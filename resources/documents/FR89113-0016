This AD requires operation of thethird IRS in the attitude mode on entire flights when intending to crossthe 180 degree meridian. This amendment is prompted by reports of FMS navigationposition jumps as high as 300 nautical miles when crossing the 180 degreemeridian. This condition, if not corrected, could result in aircraft navigationoutside the assigned airspace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>There is no applicable service information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Herb Peters, Aerospace Engineer,Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, ANM-133L, FAA, Northwest MountainRegion, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California; telephone (213)988-5353.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>An aircraft operator, whose aircraftwas equipped with dual Honeywell, Sperry FMZ-800 Flight Management Systems(FMS) and triple inertial reference systems (IRS), reported an FMS positionjump after crossing the 180 degree meridian. Investigation revealed thatthe position jump was caused by a design error in the part of the FMS'snavigation computer that determines present position when the system isreceiving position information from three IRS. The investigation also revealedthat these navigation computers operate satisfactorily when the systemis receiving position information from two or fewer IRS, and that aircraftequipped with three IRS can prevent the FMS position jump by operationof the third IRS in the attitude mode (by selecting ``ATT'' using the appropriatethird IRS mode select switch).The magnitude of the inadvertent position jump can be as high as 300 nauticalmiles, either due east or due west from the aircraft's actual position.The FMS outputs navigation information to the aircraft's course deviationindicator, flight director, and autopilot. Such an FMS position jump, ifnot corrected, could cause the aircraft to be navigated off-course. Continueduse of the erroneous data could cause the aircraft to be navigated outsideits assigned airspace.Since this condition is likely to exist on aircraft equipped with the deficientHoneywell, Inc., Sperry FMZ-800 FMS navigation computers and triple IRS,this AD requires a revision to the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual(AFM) or the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual Supplement (AFMS) to requirethat the third IRS be operated in the attitude mode on flights intendingto cross the 180 degree meridian.Honeywell has produced a family of FMS navigation computers, only someof which include the subject design error. This AD applies to any aircraftequipped with three IRS, and one or more of the deficient FMS navigationcomputers. The deficient navigation computers can be identified by thenavigation computer's part number or the navigation computer's softwareconfiguration as indicated on the FMS control display unit (CDU).This AD also provides for an optional terminating action which consistsof replacing certain software in the deficient navigation computers withmodified software. Although this action is currently optional, the FAAmay consider further rulemaking action to require the replacement of thedeficient computers in all affected aircraft.Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 with respect tothis rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in an aircraft. It has been further determined that this documentinvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
