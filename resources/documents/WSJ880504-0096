General Dynamics won the rocket job after a four-month competition with McDonnell Douglas Corp., the Air Force said. Contracts for the work are expected in coming weeks.    The medium-launch vehicles are part of a broader Air Force program to expand the space fleet and thereby lessen the military's dependence on the space shuttle or Titan rockets -- which have both experienced explosions in recent years. The 11 rockets to be built by General Dynamics will be able to lift military-communications satellites, and certain space-test vehicles, into orbit.    &quot;We're trying to build a stable of vehicles so that if something's out of commission, we can still launch,&quot; said an Air Force official.    In contracts issued yesterday, the joint venture of World Airways and Rosenbalm Aviation Inc. received a $15.3 million Air Force award for air-transportation services. World Airways' joint venture with Evergreen International Airlines also received a $12.2 million Air Force contract for air-transportation services.    Metallgesellschaft Corp., a unit of Metallgesellschaft AG, received a $13 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for gasoline and unleaded fuel.    Pan American World Airways, a unit of Pan Am Corp., was issued an $11.7 million Air Force contract for air-transportation services.    Doss Aviation Inc. got an $11.1 million Army contract for aircraft maintenance and support equipment. </TEXT></DOC>
