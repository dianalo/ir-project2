Richard M. Kovacevich, vice chairman of Minneapolis-based Norwest, said second-quarter profit would be &quot;slightly&quot; above the first quarter. He wouldn't be more specific. In last year's second quarter, Norwest posted a loss of $157.8 million because of a special $200 million reserve against troubled foreign loans.    Mr. Kovacevich also said Norwest's troubled foreign loans would decline further from the March 31 level of $108 million. Norwest has been aggressively charging off, selling and otherwise disposing of loans to troubled debtor nations.    Norwest has said the first-quarter results are &quot;sustainable,&quot; and securities analysts have projected 1988 profit in the neighborhood of $6 a share. The results mark a turnaround since 1984, when Norwest was plagued by losses on farm loans, and losses from trying to hedge its then huge mortgage-loan portfolio.    The improved earnings have been the result of far lower loan losses, reduced costs, and improved results from both Norwest's banks and its finance company, Norwest Financial.    During the record first quarter, Norwest recorded a charge against net of $14.5 million from restructuring banking operations in Nebraska, North Dakota and Montana. Mr. Kovacevich said in an interview that a second such charge is likely some time this year as the company restructures its banking operations in Minnesota and Iowa, but that the charge won't have a big impact on profit. He wouldn't elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
