Schlesinger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> C LABOR </CO><IN> AUT </IN><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp., frustrated over its inability to end a costly strike at its St. Louis area minivan plant, took the unusual step of suing the local union there.    The company, in a motion filed Friday in federal court in St. Louis, contends that the walkout is illegal because it stems from issues that should be dealt with in national bargaining, not in local negotiations. Chrysler is seeking an injunction to end the walkout, as well as damages from United Auto Workers Local 110.    A hearing on the motion is scheduled for this morning.    Analysts estimate that Chrysler loses as much as $4 million in profit each day the plant is idle, and the strike already has cost Chrysler 10 days of production. That means it has eroded fourth-quarter earnings more than 10% from Wall Street projections, which are in the range of $360 million.    Thus, the strike is a severe blow to the company's renewed efforts to maintain market share while increasing profit margins, which have been depressed by buyer incentives during the past year.    On Friday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Chrysler common was actively traded and closed at $25.375, up 37.5 cents, on volume of 1.2 million shares.    The strike by the plant's 3,200 employees began Oct.5. The extended-body Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager minivans made at the St. Louis plant are so popular that the plant has been working extensive overtime, including six-day weeks. That means there's no way the company can make up for lost production.    The work stoppage started after Chrysler's local agreement at the plant expired and talks on a new pact broke down. The union's leadership reached a tentative agreement with the company two days into the walkout, but the rank and file rejected it by an overwhelming margin.    Last Wednesday, the union leadership put the pact up for another vote without making any changes. It was rejected again, although the vote was closer.    Company officials and national union leaders say it isn't entirely clear to them why the pact is being rejected. But Chrysler, in its lawsuit, asserts that the main reason is worker dissatisfaction with protections against outsourcing, or the transfer of work to non-Chrysler employees.    Chrysler argues that outsourcing is an issue covered exclusively in the national agreement, which was signed last May. It says local contracts, which govern plant working conditions, don't have the authority to cover that issue.    &quot;We resorted to {the lawsuit} because we think the strike is improper,&quot; Anthony P. St. John, Chrysler's vice president, human resources, said. &quot;It {the strike} is attempting to address national issues.&quot;    Morris Levin, the attorney representing Local 110, responded that the specific issue doesn't matter. &quot;Expiration of the local agreement leaves them without the restriction of the no-strike provision&quot; that's in Chrysler's national contract with the UAW, he said.    Meanwhile, attempts to settle the strike outside the courtroom appear to be stalled. Mr. St. John said &quot;it's been several days&quot; since the company and the local union have met to discuss the walkout. </TEXT></DOC>
