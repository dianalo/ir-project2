(officials and employees).andO;Topic:     AttitudeInterviewCommunications IndustryTelephone Companies.andO;Person:    Harvey, George (interviews).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>George HarveyandM;George Harvey is president and chief executive officer of Unitel.andM;Harvey has presided over the company's name change from CNCPTelecommunications and its application to the Canadian Radio-television andTelecommunications Commission (CRTC) to provide public long-distance service,both of which occurred earlier this year.andM;Harvey spoke to Computing Canada communications editor Mike Edwards at Unitelheadquareters in toronto.andM;United Communications Inc.andM;United Communications Inc. of Toronto is a national facilities-basedtelecommunications carrier with fibre optic, digital microwave and radionetworks.andM;Major partners in Unitel are Canadian Pacific Ltd. and Rogers CommunicationsInc.andM;CC: Has the recent CRTC relaxation around resale of long distance servicesaffected your current business?andM;Harvey: Not yet, I mean it's only (become) effective May 29.andP;  It will growour business because the resellers tend to come to Unitel for the provisionof circuits.andP;  So we see this as very positive.andM;I think you would understand the resellers have more of an affinity withUnitel than they have with the telephone company, who fought so long to keepthem out of this business.andM;(For example), we supported CallNet all the way through and is one of ourbiggest customers now.andM;So there is nothing but goodness out of the CRTC ruling (90-3) and we see ourbusiness growing.andP;  And yes, they will take some voice business away from usbut bare in mind we haven't been really allowed into the voice business so itwill be the telephone companies that will be competing against the CallNetsof this world.andM;CC: How does Unitel serve the small business?andM;Harvey: Today with our business the only way we can really serve smallbusiness, generally speaking, is through our facsimile service, FacsRoute.andM;But small business by definition doesn't have a multitude of office buildingsor plants around the country so there is no real requirement for datatransmission, even though we supply low-speed circuits.andM;By regulation we really are prevented from servicing the small companies.andM;CC: How do you see the telephone companies recent rate reductions?andM;Harvey: Well first of all since 1985 there have been several reductions, allwhich were ordered by the CRTC.andM;So historically the telephone companies have never volunteered to come inwith rate reductions so why suddenly do they do that in 1990.andP;  They do itbecause we have made public our intention to file an application to break themonopoly in long-distance voice.andM;And one of the planks that we were using and still do use is the fact thatthere is no incentive for the telephone companies to reduce prices, it'salways ordered upon them.andM;CC: What about the assertion that your objective isn't to compete in longdistance but to skim away revenues from toll service at the expense of localrates?andM;Harvey: Well actually there are two accusations there and they are two verygood questions.andM;First of all we are not cream skimming because we will be covering the entirepopulation in all of the provinces in which we have applied, and the otherswe are not allowed to apply to.andM;So we are covering the rural areas as well as the urban areas.andP;  And you haveto understand that we have a network today that has over 900 end-points(circuit terminations) in it.andP;  Which means that we are represented in over900 different towns, villages, hamlets and cities in Canada already.andM;So we have no need to cream skim because we've got people out there.andP;  Andthat's our telex heritage .andP;  .  .  we have the network in place.andM;Now the last time around (1985) I would have to agree that the previousmanagement was so conservative in the rollout of the long-distance voicesercices that it appeared as if they were cream skimming.andM;This time we are being extremely aggressive in our roll-out plan, which hasus covering about 140 regions of the country in the first three years.andM;So that's the cream skimming side.andP;  Now what about local rates--I think thisis the biggest single issue that will be raised over the next (seven) months,and we have gone public very, very firmly indeed and said that local ratesshould not be raised a dime because of our entry into the marketplace.andM;First of all it is a stated fact that long-distance revenues do subsidizelocal rates, and that's the same everywhere in the world in the telephoneindustry.andM;So no one is disputing that.andP;  So the real argument comes down to will thetelephone companies' revenues be reduced by Unitel's entry into themarketplace?andP;  Because if they're not reduced then they have still the sameamount of revenue to subsidize from.andM;Historically the telephone companies, every time that competition has beenthreatened or enacted, starting in 1979 with the authority for CNCP then toprovide corporate networks, in 1982 when CRTC allowed what was calledterminal attachment.andM;In 1985 when we last applied and that was rejected, but the telephone companysaid yes we do admit long-distance rates are too high but local rates have noflexibility so we'll bring the one down and raise the other, raise localrates -- in 1987 when resale and sharing was first implemented, and in 1990this time around, when it was reconfirmed.andP;  They've always said local ratesare bound to go up because our revenues are going to decline because Unitelor CallNet or someone will take revenues away from us.andM;And guess what's happened--nothing.andP;  Yet our revenues have gone up, and theirrevenues have gone up because the pie has got bigger, or the market hasexpanded through choice and lower prices.andM;Now they can turn around and say well that's all very well, you're talkingabout a different marketplace, terminal attachment, PBXs, phone and hand setsor corporate network -- long-distance voice is different.andP;  I can then turnaround and say well ATandamp;T revenues in the U.S.andP;  in long-distance voice havenot decreased since 1984, and yet their market share has decreased from 97per cent to 70 per cent and prices have dropped 45 per cent.andM;But their revenues have gone up slightly.andP;  So even in the long-distance voicemarket with an almost 30 per cent lower market share and the 40 odd per centprice reduction their revenues have stayed the same or gone up.andM;And the same with British Telcom in the U.K., so it does apply tolong-distance voice as well.andM;And (another point) is we will be paying in total for all of the telephonecompany's services a majority of our revenues back to them.andP;  So that'srevenue to them.andP;  So if we are paying over 50 per cent of our revenues backto them, they've already gained over 50 cents for every dollar we take away.andO;And as we say the pie (will) get bigger anyway.andM;So that's why we say the local rates do not need to increase at all .andP;  .  . andO;(but) because they are bound to oppose competition, they (the telcos) have totry and protect their monopoly they have to come up with reasons why theyshould oppose it.andM;Cream skimming and local rates are the only two they really use -- there areone or two others like is this country big enough (such as) to build a secondhighway?andP;  Well a) the second highway is already built and we havecoast-to-coast network already, b) if this country is not big enough why hasBell Canada (Enterprises, BCE) gone into New Zealand to compete; which is acountry one eighth of the size (of Canada)?andM;I assume they think they can make money out of it otherwise they wouldn't begoing wasting shareholders value.andM;CC: So how long before long distance rates in Canada are more in line withATandamp;T rates?andM;Harvey: I would suspect you will see a gradual closing of the gap over fiveyears.andP;  I don't think, nor do I ever think we can get as low as the U.S.andP;  nordo I think people believe we can.andP;  Because they see we are a countrygeographically 25 per cent bigger than the U.S.andP;  with one tenth thepopulation.andM;So we've got an infrastructure to support but I predict a continuing closingof the price gap, and maybe in the end you'll get 30 per cent difference butthat's a lot bettern than 100, 200, 300 per cent differences.andM;I mean you could never be precise on prices because it depends upon theservice and the distance and the time of day.andM;CC: Besides the recent extra fibre route to Montreal, what are some of yourhalf billion-dollar expansion plans?andM;Harvey: Over the five-year period that we are talking about there will be afibre route across the Prairies, a continuation of the modernization of ournetwork.andP;  We want to be totally digital by 1992.andM;We are (also) building a digital network in Newfoundland beginning later onthis year and goin into 1991.andM;We now have regulatory authority to sell in New Brunswick, and we are in thefinal stages of negotiating with Maritime Tel.andP;  (At press time, thepossibility of going into Alberta was raised by Unitel officials.)andO;</TEXT></DOC>
