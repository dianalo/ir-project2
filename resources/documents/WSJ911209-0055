As a result, the unit's work force will be cut to as fewas 4,200 from 5,200 currently, a 19% drop. This step willcome as existing contracts are concluded, through normalattrition and through &quot;elimination of less essentialpositions,&quot; McDonnell Douglas said.</LP><TEXT>   The division will also consider selling portions of itsoperations. The company declined to say what assets it mightsell, but industry officials said the most likely candidatewas its ordnance line, which manufactures 30mm and 25mm gunsfor aircraft and ground vehicles.   The helicopter division, based in Mesa, Ariz., also saidit will cut its number of business sectors to seven from 10,explore options for joint ventures and possibly contract outfor certain tasks such as data processing.   &quot;We are coping with the pressures of a difficult industryand economic environment,&quot; said Tom Gunn, president of thehelicopter unit. He added that while the reorganizationshould &quot;significantly strengthen our ability to compete,&quot; theindustry has come under so much pressure that &quot;dramaticactions are required to just stay in business.&quot;   In an interview, Mr. Gunn stressed that his primary goalis to become the industry's low-cost producer. &quot;Half-measureswill avail us of nothing,&quot; he said.   The helicopter unit, which accounts for about $900 millionof the corporation's $19.5 billion in overall annual revenue,is but one of the McDonnell Douglas divisions that is lookingto retrench as military spending declines and the generaleconomy remains sluggish. Across the board, the aerospacegiant has been selling assets, laying off employees andreducing inventories. Overall, the St. Louis-basedcorporation employs about 112,000.   The helicopter unit has orders that will keep its currentproduction lines humming for the next several years, and Mr.Gunn said that the company's backlog is &quot;better than it hasbeen&quot; in some time.   But sales are definitely dwindling. At one time, forinstance, the Army had planned to purchase 1,200 Apacheattack helicopters; now it expects to buy no more than 807,of which 696 already have been delivered. The possibility ofan upgraded model of the aircraft, known as the Longbow, hasbecome more uncertain as the defense budget tightens.   Meanwhile, orders have been slowing for the company'scommercial helicopters, the MD-500E and MD-520N. There are274 potential customers that have expressed an interest inbuying a twin-engine helicopter now under development. Butthat aircraft, called the MDX, won't be produced on afull-scale basis until late 1995.   Separately, the Los Angeles Times reported that the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee has opened an investigationinto whether McDonnell Douglas improperly released insideinformation to certain investment houses before it disclosed,late last month, its tentative agreement to sell as much as40% of its jetliner division to Taiwan Aerospace Corp. Theinquiry was apparently prompted by letters received fromother investment firms, including at least one with a shortposition in McDonnell Douglas stock -- in effect, a bet thatthe stock's price would soon fall.   McDonnell Douglas's chief financial officer, HerbertLanese, said in an interview over the weekend that thecompany &quot;maintained total propriety&quot; in its disclosures ofinformation on the deal. He said that McDonnell Douglashasn't been contacted on the matter by the Securities andExchange Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, which arethe bodies that typically would investigate charges involvinginside information.</TEXT></DOC>
