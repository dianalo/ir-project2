MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   OPEC's failure to rein in production couldcontinue to weaken oil prices this week, analysts say.   On Monday, the September contract for West Texas Intermediate,the benchmark U.S. grade of crude, tumbled to a five-month low,closing at $17.91 a barrel, 12 cents lower than Friday'ssettlement. The near-term contract last closed lower on Feb. 23,when the price was $17.83.   Volume was light as many investors were unwilling to makecommitments.   ``Buyers don't want to buy this high and sellers don't want tosell this low,'' said Linda Simard, energy broker at Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.   Gasoline futures traded on the exchange also fell, with theSeptember contract finishing down 0.49 cent at 49.75 cents agallon. Heating oil for September delivery lost 0.63 cent to finishat 48.55 cents a gallon.   Crude prices have fallen more than $2.80 a barrel since July 5as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued topump more oil than the market could absorb.   Various estimates put OPEC production at 21.3 million to 21.8million barrels a day in July _ nearly 3 million barrels higherthan this time last year and about 2 million barrels more than the19.5 million-barrel ceiling set by OPEC when it met in June.   ``One clear message seems to be that the system of proportionalquota increases applied in Vienna in June just doesn't work,''Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an industry publication, said in areport released Monday.   ``Revenue needs seem just as important as OPEC rivalries insparking increased production this summer,'' it said.   The International Energy Agency estimates that world oilconsumption this year will average 52.1 million barrels a day, 2.4percent more than in 1988, but demand appears to be easing.   Too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than $5 inWTI from $18.52 on April 18, 1988, to the year's low of $12.60 onOct. 5. While analysts don't expect anything that dramatic thisyear they see prices continuing to weaken before they recover.   Some predict prices could fall to $17.50 a barrel before OPEC'snext meeting, scheduled for Sept. 23 in Geneva, to discuss whetherto raise or lower the production cap in the final three months ofthe year.   ``Eventually people feel OPEC will get it together and priceswill get strong, but in the immediate situation, there's going tobe a little bit of pain,'' said James R. Fiedler, vice president incharge of energy brokering for E.D.andamp;F. Man International FuturesInc.   Dillard Spriggs, president of New York-based Petroleum AnalysisLtd., believes prices could fall even further to around $16.50 abarrel by the time OPEC meets.   ``I see this continuing,'' Spriggs said. ``OPEC's productivecapacity is higher than people think and it's growing, particularlybecause of Iraq.''   Iraq said recently that a new export pipeline would add 1.5million barrels a day to its current capacity by next year. Therepair of oil terminals damaged in its eight-year war with Iranalso is expected to expand its capacity.   Weakness in the gasoline market also has pressured crude pricesin recent weeks.   Exaggerated estimates of strong demand and concern about supplyproblems due to the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, refinery maintenancedelays, accidents and production problems in the North Sea ledrefiners to produce too much gasoline too quickly. As inventoriespiled up because of slow demand, prices have eroded.   U.S. refineries in recent days lowered the posted wellhead pricefor WTI by 25 cents to $17.25 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
