The scramble by the Jackles to find a trustworthy sitter fortheir 5-year-old reflects the growth in two-income families amongthe baby-boom generation, which in turn has created an enormousproblem for working parents nationwide _ caring for their kids andpaying for it.   ``Nowadays, it seems if you're going to need care you'd betterget set up before you get pregnant,'' said Louise Hurst, a licensedday-care professional who watches the Jackle boy and five othersmall children in her home.   ``I've gotten lots of calls,'' said Mrs. Hurst, 43. ``I informthem I'm full until September 1991, so I don't even bother to takea waiting list.''   Demand for child care has grown so fast that costs havemultiplied, in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from asecond income.   This has crimped budgets of millions of Americans, created anunderground cash economy of unregulated care-givers, and forcedmany companies to offer allowances ranging from flexible workschedules to emergency sitters to attract or retain valuedemployees.   Some prominent employers have gone further, allowing youngmothers and fathers to work at home or take years off with fullbenefits and job guarantees. Others are building in-house day-carecenters, hiring roving nannies or subsidizing the cost of care withcash payments.   ``Certainly it's fashionable these days for corporations to getinto this,'' said Antony Ward, director of Child Care Inc., a NewYork referral service retained by many companies to assistemployees in finding help.   ``A lot of people viscerally respond to the child-care issue,''he said. ``Anyone who takes the kid to the family day-care providerto find a note on the door saying, `I have the flu,' knows whatit's like.''   First Bank System of St. Paul, Minn., for example, has donatedspace in its office this year for a public kindergarten thatdoubles as an after-school day-care center, with priority given tochildren of bank employees. NCNB Corp., a fast-growing bank inCharlotte, N.C., plans to offer up to a 50 percent reimbursement ofchild-care costs to many of its workers.   Pitney Bowes Inc., a leading maker of business machines inStamford, Conn., helped pioneer flexible working hours toaccommodate working parents, allowing them to arrive early somedays and leave early on others. Federal Express Corp., the Memphis,Tenn., overnight delivery service, offers working parents four-dayweeks and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shifts.   Last month, seven large New York-based employers announced apilot program of emergency child care for workers whose usualarrangements have been disrupted. The program is aimed at reducingabsenteeism.   ``Companies are finding that if they're not family friendly,they're losing employees,'' said Lorraine Dusky, a free-lancewriter who co-authored ``The Best Companies for Women,'' aguidebook to 50 leading American corporations. ``Companies aren'tdoing this to be altruistic. If companies don't do something, we'rein trouble.''   Nonetheless, the high-profile benefits of a relatively fewcompanies mask what critics call a deepening crisis in a labor poolcomprised increasingly of women, historically the primary familycare-givers.   Child-care activists say the majority of businesses will notconcede that it's a a work-related issue, despite evidence thatemployer assistance leads to lower turnover, higher employee moraleand improved productivity. Moreover, they say the federalgovernment isn't providing much help.   Although a bill that would vastly expand federal support forchild care is working through Congress, it faces the possibility ofa White House veto because of the estimated $22.7 billion cost overthe next five years.   President Bush has proposed more modest legislation that wouldcost $2.5 billion a year by 1993, mostly through tax credits.Still, that's less than $20 a week or about $1,000 a year, andwould only go to lower-income families.   By contrast, out-of-home, child-care costs can range from $1,500to $10,000 a year, the Conference Board business research groupsaid in a study. Other studies have shown in-home costs can go muchhigher.   ``We have a system that has not caught up with rapid socialchange in our society, in which more women are back in the laborforce and need child care,'' said Esther J. Kahn, director ofParent's Place, a San Francisco counseling and referral service.``Our society hasn't provided support for families.''   A study for the Labor Department by the Hudson Institute, anIndianapolis research organization, shows women now comprise nearlyhalf the work force, compared with 38.1 percent in 1970 and 29.6percent in 1950.   Other Labor Department figures show 57 percent of all women withchildren under 6 work outside the home, vs. 12 percent in 1950. Astudy by the Children's Defense Fund, a Washington-basedchild-advocacy group, predicts two-thirds of all preschool childrenwill have mothers in the work force by 1995.   ``Only 7 percent of American households now fit the BeaverCleaver family's mold of breadwinning father and at-home mother,''says a policy paper by the Child Care Action Campaign, a New Yorkcoalition that advocates a national system of care. ``As femalelabor force participation rates continue to climb, the demand forchild care will grow, too.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
