In Chile,the military paid import bills.   Still more money went to pad foreign bank accounts of corruptpoliticians, bureaucrats and businessmen. Estimates are that $15billion of Brazil's $115 billion debt, $20 billion of Argentina's$56 billion debt and $22 billion of Venezuela's $32 billion wentinto private accounts abroad.   Lending didn't reach a standstill until 1982, when Mexicoannounced it did not have the money to meet a monthly payment. Theannouncement sent shivers through financial circles abroad and talkarose of a world economic crisis.   U.S. banks were the most exposed, with $72 billion in Latinloans. As much as 20 percent of Citicorp profits and 25 percent ofother bank revenues were from loans to Brazil alone.   Some experts now say if banks were to write off at least part ofthe debt major financial turmoil could be avoided.   ``At best it would mean the collapse of one or two New Yorkbanks,'' said Rudigar Dornbusch, an economics professor at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology and an adviser to debtornations.   Though new money from private banks no longer financeddevelopment projects after 1982, South America's debt almostdoubled as nations rolled over payments in endless accords withcreditors as interest rates soared.   A Chilean opposition leader, Ricardo Lagos, maintains the debtwas simply ``kicked ahead'' for future governments to pay.   ``You've got a situation in which the emperor has no clothes,''Dornbusch said. ``The debt is being shown up for what it really is.It isn't payable under present terms.''   In Brazil, economic austerity measures slashed wages by 50percent in the past five years, while 25 percent of theeconomically active population can't find regular jobs. Thegovernment estimates 60 percent of the population struggles by onthe equivalent of less than $80 a month, while the country hasspent $50 billion meeting interest bills since 1984.   Argentina's annual per capita income dropped to the equivalentof $1,630 in 1988 from $1,990 in 1980, according to the World Bank.   In Chile, 38 percent of the 12 million people live below thepoverty line, according to Ernesto Tironi of the EconomicCommission for Latin America.   In smaller South American nations, the situation is moredramatic.   Cocaine earns Colombia more than coffee, its principal export.Peru and Bolivia earn more from cocaine than from all theirofficial exports together, according to a U.S. presidentialcommission.   Peru has virtually suspended debt payments by linking capitaloutflows to 10 percent of export earnings but still the economyshrank nearly 9 percent last year. Inflation is projected at 10,000percent this year and one in every three people doesn't have asteady job.   The discontent has fed the election campaigns in Argentina andBrazil.   In Argentina, Peronist candidate Carlos Menem hinted he mightimpose a five-year moratorium on debt payments if elected on May 14.   In Brazil, Leonel Brizola of the Democratic Labor Party, afront-running presidential prospect, has argued for a suspension ofpayments on the debt ``contracted in an orgy of lending between themilitary government and banks.''   Another front-runner in Brazil, Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva ofthe Workers Party, says he agrees with Cuba's Fidel Castro: LatinAmerica should pay no more. Brazilians vote Nov. 15.   If creditors do not write off part of what is owed ``democracywill be threatened and leftist alternatives will start lookingattractive to the people,'' says Brazil's President Sarney.   And that, he adds, could bring on another cycle of militarycoups.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Lisa Genasci reported for The Associated Pressfrom Brazil for 2{ years and now is an editor on the Foreign Deskat its headquarters in New York.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 30</NOTE></DOC>
