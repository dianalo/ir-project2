Levine, a former investment banker whose May 12, 1986, arrest ignited the insider-trading scandal, was released Thursday from a halfway house for federal prisoners.    He was released after serving 18 months of the two-year sentence he received after pleading guilty to securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. Michael J. Luciano, chief U.S. probation officer for Manhattan, said Mr. Levine was released after &quot;earning good time&quot; and will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Commission until Oct. 5.    Mr. Levine reportedly will be a management consultant for a non-financial related business concern. He was transferred to the halfway house on July 5, 1988, from the Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp in Lewisburg, Pa.    Mr. Levine was charged with making $12.6 million while allegedly trading on inside information in 54 securities since mid-1980 while employed at four different firms. In June 1986, he settled civil insider-trading charges by agreeing to disgorge about $11.5 million in illegal profits. </TEXT></DOC>
