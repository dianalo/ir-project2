L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy ConservationPolicy Act (NECPA), Pub. L. 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, and the National ApplianceEnergy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Pub. L. 100-12, which requiresDOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumptionof certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the testprocedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption thatwill assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test proceduresappear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. DOE has amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process, 45 FR 64108. DOE furtheramended the Department's appliance test procedure waiver process to allowthe Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy to grantan interim waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers thathave petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51FR 42823, November 26, 1986. The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy to waive temporarily test proceduresfor a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic modelcontains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing accordingto the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test proceduresmay evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its trueenergy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendmentsbecome effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of a waiver.The interim waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the AssistantSecretary to grant an interim waiver when it is determined that the applicantwill experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiveris denied, if it appears likely that the petition for waiver will be grantedand/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable forpublic policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determinationon the petition for waiver. Rheem's petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that requirea 1.5 minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the startingof the circulating air blower. Instead, Rheem requests the allowance totest using a 30 second blower time delay when testing its condensing furnacesmodels (-) GEB and (-) GKA. Rheem states that the 30 second delay is indicativeof how these condensing furnaces actually operate. Such a delay resultsin an energy savings of approximately 1.8 percent. Since current DOE testprocedures do not address this variable blower time delay, Rheem asks thatthe waiver be granted. The Department finds that it would be desirable to public policy reasonsto grant Rheem's Application for Interim Waiver. Specifically, in thoseinstances where DOE has granted a waiver for a similar product design,it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and ratedfor energy consumption on a comparable basis. Previous waivers for thistype of timed blower delay control have been granted to the Coleman Company,and to the Magic Chef Company. 50 FR, 2710, January 18, 1985, 50 FR 41553,October 11, 1985, respectively. Therefore, Rheem's Application for an Interim Waiver requesting relieffrom the DOE test procedures for its condensing furnace models (-) GEBand (-) GKA is granted.Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The petition contains no confidentialinformation. DOE solicits comments, data, and information respecting thepetition. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (e) of andSection;430.27 of the Code ofFederal Regulations, the following letter granting the Application forInterim Waiver was issued to the Rheem Manufacturing Company.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, June 17, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.

Waiver is requestedfrom the condensing furnace test procedure found at Appendix N to SubpartB of Part 430. This test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay betweenburner on and blower on. Rheem is requesting authorization to use a 30second delay instead of 1.5 minutes. Rheem will be manufacturing a seriesof condensing furnaces which include the (^)GEB upflow models and (^)GKAdownflow models. Maximum energy efficiency is achieved by fixed timingcontrols installed in these models that activate the circulating air blower30 seconds after the burner is on. Under the Appendix N procedures, thestack temperature is allowed to climb higher than its equilibrium temperatureallowing a substantial amount of energy to be lost out the vent system.This waste of energy would not occur in actual operation. If this petitionis granted, the true blower on time delay would be used in the calculations.Proposed ASHRAE Standard 103-1982R of 9/25/87 paragraph 9.5.1.2.2 specificallyaddresses the use of time blower operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The current test procedures do not give Rheem credit for the energysavings which averages approximately 1.8%. This improvement is an averagereduction of 20% of the energy loss. Rheem is of the opinion that a 20%reduction is a significant energy savings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Current prescribed test procedures prohibit Rheem from taking creditfor the saved energy, thus providing inaccurate comparative data. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Confidential comparative test data is available to you upon your request,confirming the above energy savings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">  Sincerely, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Daniel J.
