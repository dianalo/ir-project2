Ralph Tyler III of the Maryland attorney general's office plansto argue before the high court Tuesday that the importance ofprotecting an endangered child outweighs the constitutional claimof Jacqueline Bouknight, who has been jailed in Baltimore for 18months for contempt of court.   Her lawyers say the case could affect whether courts may usetheir contempt powers to persuade defendants to produce evidencethat could help convict them.   ``If Ralph were right ... we wouldn't need a criminal code. Wecould just hold people in contempt until they produce theevidence,'' said George Burns Jr., a state public defender who isrepresenting Bouknight.   City social workers have not seen Bouknight's son Maurice, now 3years old, for more than two years and fear he may be dead.   Maurice, born on Oct. 3, 1986, was hospitalized twice before hewas 4 months old with pneumonia and a broken leg. Social workerssaid his mother was seen shaking the baby and dropping him into hishospital crib. According to prosecutors, X-rays revealed the childhad previous bone fractures.   The state took protective custody of the child for severalmonths, but his mother regained custody in July 1987, afterpromising not to physically punish him and to undergo training inparenthood.   Nine months later, after social workers said Bouknight hadceased to cooperate with them and would not show them her son, ajuvenile court issued a civil contempt order that she be jaileduntil she revealed his whereabouts.   Bouknight, now 23, remains in the Baltimore City Jail. Herattorneys refused to allow her to be interviewed, saying she ishampered by severe learning difficulties, although she meets legalstandards of mental competency.   ``She's sort of a lost soul,'' Burns said, noting that he couldnot find any relatives of Bouknight's. ``I know of no real workbackground. I think she's probably lived from place to place.''   Maurice's father, who had been jailed for distributing cocaine,was shot to death in March 1988, and Bouknight had a history ofdrug use, according to testimony in juvenile court.   Defense attorneys say if the child has been harmed or killed,Bouknight would be the most likely suspect, even if someone elsewere responsible.   ``If she said, `I can't produce the baby, the baby's dead andgone,' it doesn't take a very imaginative prosecutor to add up thefacts,'' Burns said. ``... You can have successful prosecutions ofinnocent people.''   The Fifth Amendment forbids authorities from compelling peopleto testify against themselves but does not prohibit courts fromordering them to perform certain actions, Tyler said. For example,courts have held that suspects can be required to provide samplesof their blood, handwriting and voice, and to stand in a policelineup.   ``Here, Ms. Bouknight can comply with the juvenile court's orderand produce Maurice without uttering a sound to any representativeof the state,'' Tyler said in written arguments. ``... Maurice'sright to freedom from bodily harm and the state's obligation toprotect that right are fundamental societal values which outweighMs. Bouknight's marginal Fifth Amendment claim.''   Dan Goldstein, a Baltimore criminal defense lawyer and formerfederal prosecutor, said the state's argument that the rightagainst self-incrimination should be balanced against the need tosafeguard children provokes an ``unnecessary constitutionalconfrontation.''   If the state's only object were to protect children, the GeneralAssembly could pass a law granting immunity from prosecution toparents in Bouknight's position, he said.   ``The state's attack goes to the very heart of the FifthAmendment,'' Goldstein said. ``This case really poses the risk forthe first time that the absolute protection of the Fifth Amendmentcan be breached.''   The Maryland Court of Appeals, voting 5-2, ruled Dec. 19 thatjailing Bouknight for refusing to produce Maurice violated herconstitutional rights and that she should be released immediately.But the same day, U.S. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist set asidethat decision, pending review by the full Supreme Court.</TEXT></DOC>
