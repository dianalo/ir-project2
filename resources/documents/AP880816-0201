Humayun Khan identified the airman as Col. AlexanderVladimirovich Rudskoi and said his Su-25 fighter was shot down by aPakistani F-16 fighter Aug. 4 near the village of Miranshah, lessthan 15 miles from the Afghan border.   Khan charged Rudskoi was on a combat mission, and the plane was``fully armed and equipped with cluster bombs.'' He said Rudskoiwas captured after he parachuted from the plane.   He also alleged that the Kremlin and Afghanistan's communistgovernment have staged other air raids in Pakistan in violation ofa U.N.-mediated plan for peace in Afghanistan.   There was no immediate comment from Soviet diplomats inIslamabad.   The foreign secretary said members of a U.N. observationwitnessed the airman's release to the Soviet Embassy. Pakistanasked the team to look into the incursion into Pakistani airspace.   Under the Geneva accords, signed in April, the Soviets said theywould pull their troops out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989.Soviet, Afghan and U.N. officials said half the troops had beenwithdrawn by a Monday deadline. Soviet forces intervened inAfghanistan in December 1979.   The Soviet Union says Pakistan is a conduit for arms to Afghanguerrillas and allows guerrilla bases on its territory in violationof the pact.   Khan said the Soviet plane was shot down while Foreign MinisterSahabzada Yaqub Khan was in Moscow meeting with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze.   ``I might mention that, in (that) meeting, both sides assuredthe other of their continued compliance with the Geneva accords.''   On Aug. 3, four people were killed when an intruding Soviet orAfghan fighter jet bombed Pakistan near Miranshah, Khan said.   In October 1986, Pakistan captured six helicopter pilots wholanded in Pakistani territory. They later were released to theSoviet Embassy, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
