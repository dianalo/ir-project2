He'd run through it in less than a couple ofweeks.   It seems there just aren't enough rich people, no matter whatyou've heard. They don't have enough money, either. And if you takeit all in one year, there'll probably be even fewer of them the next.   Based on 1986 tax returns, 35,875 individuals had adjusted grossincome of more than $1 million. That might seem like a lot, but in arelative sense it isn't _ just 0.03 percent of all taxpayers.   Examining the data, the Tax Foundation, which describes itself asa nonprofit research organization, determined that the group'sadjusted gross income was $82.3 billion, taxable income was $66.3billion and tax owed totaled $33.7 billion.   That taxable income was the result of an effective tax rate of 41percent. Had the rate been 100 percent, it would have put another$32.6 billion into Uncle Sam's pockets. It would have lasted him 12days.   There just aren't enough millionaires to accomplish what thesoak-the-rich folks desire. They must dig deeper for pay dirt. The``rich'' category must be expanded to include those with taxableincome of $500,000 or more.   Now we're talking, you say. But, no, we're really not.   Based on the foundation's examination, 92,621 individual returnsshowed taxable income of $500,000 or more in 1986. Had they beentaxed 100 percent, it would have provided an additional $53.7billion, sufficient for 19.8 days.   There just aren't enough half-millionaires either. The categoryof ``rich'' must be expanded again, this time to include the ``welloff,'' or those with taxable income of $200,000 or more. Now we'rereally talking.   Really? In 1986 there were nearly 400,000 of them. Had they beentaxed 100 percent, the government would have been $88.4 billionricher. Those are big bucks in any comparison, but Uncle Sam wouldhave run through them in a month.   Efforts to dig deeper into the tax lode produces similarlyfrustrating returns. To attempt doing it inevitably would have aneffect opposite to that intended. Take all a person's taxableincome, and the person will stop producing it.   And, though they appear wealthy, some of these taxpayers probablyaren't. Some, for example, are ``rich'' just once in a lifetime _when they sell the farm or the family business. Their wealth is theresult of years of work.   To dig deeper is, eventually, to strike the middle classes _upper and lower _ whence most of the revenues already come. Theyhave no more to give. Already, the buck has stopped at the middleclass.   If the rich can't help then certainly the poor cannot either.How, therefore, do you relieve the middle class of its burden?   You probably cannot. America is a nation of middle-classcitizens; no other nation has produced more. A big middle class haslong been one of the nation's proudest boasts.   It is the nation's strength, its symbol of accomplishment, itsproof of the system, its stability. It is also the nation'staxpayer, and aside perhaps from a bottle of aspirin or some othertoken, relief is not in sight.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv AMs Tuesday, Sept. 26.</NOTE></DOC>
