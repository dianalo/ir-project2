In Los Angeles, the government will ask a U.S. judge to extradite London stockbroker Anthony Parnes for his alleged role in a possibly illegal share-support operation during the British brewing and distilling giant's bid.    If the extradition effort fails, the British government loses more than the chance to prosecute a key suspect. It also could lose access to an important source of evidence against other accused individuals. Five other prominent British businessmen, including former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders, have been arrested and charged as part of the government investigation.    In addition, the Parnes hearing will offer the first courtroom test of the strength of the government's criminal case in the Guinness scandal. &quot;It'll be the first look at the evidence by a judge, albeit not English,&quot; says a high-ranking official at Scotland Yard.    It isn't a cut-and-dried case. Most allegations in Britain's extradition request relate to Mr. Parnes's purported role in finding friendly buyers of Guinness shares during the #2.53 billion ($4.68 billion) bid. Since December 1986, the government and police have been probing whether improper share-price manipulation or other possible illegal tactics helped Guinness's bid, made up mainly of stock, to succeed. A 25% jump in Guinness's share price during late stages of the bid drove the offer's value above a competing bid by Argyll Group PLC.    But stock-market manipulation isn't an extraditable offense in the U.S. So, the British government's extradition request relies on charges that Mr. Parnes stole money from Guinness. These charges may be harder to prove. Yesterday, a London attorney reiterated Mr. Parnes's denial of any wrongdoing, saying he &quot;has always maintained his innocence of the charges laid against him and has instructed us to contest the extradition vigorously.&quot;    Even if the U.S. judge agrees to extradite Mr. Parnes, the stockbroker can appeal, a process that could take years. In at least one previous instance, Scotland Yard failed to extradite a corporate fraud suspect from the U.S., despite several years of efforts.    A second Scotland Yard official said police hope the U.S. government's repeated refusal to grant Mr. Parnes bail may discourage him from undertaking the lengthy appeals process. The stockbroker has been imprisoned since his arrest in Los Angeles last September as he stepped off a plane from the United Kingdom with his wife and children.    Mr. Parnes's presence at a later trial in London could prove crucial to the British government. According to a pre-hearing memorandum the U.S. government filed in court on Britain's behalf, the stockbroker allegedly played a key role in the purported share-support operation. He acted as liaison between Guinness and several friendly share purchasers, the memorandum said. He also allegedly helped conceal secret Guinness payments rewarding buyers for their support. And he was allegedly paid #3.35 million for his own assistance, through a possibly nonexistent Swiss company.    Mr. Parnes likely wouldn't testify for the government. But if he chooses to testify for himself, his defense could help the government's case against other defendants. The stockbroker's courtroom testimony could corroborate that of probable government witnesses, such as Olivier Roux, another former Guinness executive.    Mr. Parnes's pre-hearing memorandum contained some surprises. He asserted that Ephraim Margulies, chairman of Sandamp;W Berisford PLC, a large British food and commodities concern, also was paid by Guinness for participating in the share-support operation.    Messrs. Parnes and Margulies &quot;discussed the possibility of fabricating evidence&quot; they intended to give to British government inspectors, the U.S. government said in its pre-hearing memorandum. U.S. officials based their assertion on Mr. Parnes's statements to British investigators.    In a statement earlier this week, Mr. Margulies said &quot;there is no truth in any suggestion that I have been a party to any wrongdoing whatsoever.&quot;    The Parnes hearing also may prove a bellwether for other possible extradition proceedings. In an unrelated court case, Guinness's new management has alleged that former executives made secret payments to Thomas Ward, a former director and a U.S. lawyer, for work related to the Distillers takeover.    British police want to question Mr. Ward, although they have not charged or attempted to extradite him. If they tried to do so, failure to extradite Parnes would set a bad precedent. &quot;It's important that we don't lose&quot; the Parnes hearing, the first Scotland Yard official said.    ---   Distribution Unit in Japan   Special to The Wall Street Journal -   LONDON -- Guinness PLC said it has set up a company in Japan to handle distribution of some of its liquor brands.    The company estimated that the value of Guinness's business in Japan directly under its control will be #430 million ($795 million) a year.    The British drinks group's Japan unit will begin operating April 1 and will employ 135 people. It will handle distribution in Japan of Johnnie Walker and Old Parr whiskeys and various other liquor brands. </TEXT></DOC>
