Although the Japanese still will put up some cash for the767-X and some of their profits will be tied to the overallsuccess of the plane, the tentative arrangement means thatBoeing essentially will be funding the estimated $3 billiondevelopment program out of its own pocket.</LP><TEXT>   The setup also means that there is likely to be more workleft on the 767-X for U.S. companies, particularly defensecontractors that are looking for ways to keep their factoriespumping in the face of the declining military budget. Boeingsingled out Lockheed Corp., Grumman Corp. and RockwellInternational Corp. as finding themselves with a shrinkingnumber of Pentagon contracts.   The Japanese firms, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy IndustriesLtd., have for 12 years supplied Boeing with major parts forthe 767, including fuselage panels, landing-gear doors anddrag-reducing forms called fairings. All told, those partsare equivalent to about 15% of the value of the twin-jet'sairframe.   On the 767-X, the companies will build the same sorts ofequipment, equal to as much as 20% of the plane's structure.In addition, Japanese representatives will be stationed inthe 767-X program office in Seattle, which will give them anexpanded insight into how the plane is coming along.   &quot;It's a step up from what they're doing on the 767, butnot a big step,&quot; said Lawrence Clarkson, senior vicepresident, government and international affairs, at Boeing'scommercial aircraft unit.   Indeed, unlike true equity participants, the Japanesewon't be entitled to straight revenue-sharing on the 767-X,which is to be designated the 777 once orders are placed,launching what could well emerge into an entire family ofmedium-range to long-range planes. They also won't beentitled to peruse Boeing's books.   Most important, the Japanese firms won't be privy to keytechnological procedures from which they could glean how allthe subassemblies of the 767-X will be integrated to make thecomplete plane. And although they will be aware of theairlines with which Boeing is haggling over 767-X orders,they won't attend meetings with those carriers or be allowedto come to internal marketing sessions.   In short, the Japanese will be observers, notdecision-makers. Many industry-watchers and news reports hadfor months asserted that the Japanese role would be muchgreater, though sources indicated to this newspaper severalweeks ago that the possibility of partnership on the 767-Xwas growing more remote.   The final outcome is welcome news to those who worriedthat if the Japanese had been granted more to do on the767-X, they could have used it to begin building their ownformidable aerospace industry. Aircraft-making remains one ofthe few high-tech areas in which the U.S. has a leg up on itseconomic competitors around the globe, and General DynamicsCorp.'s recent co-development pact with Mitsubishi on the FSXfighter consequently drew the ire of many Washingtonlawmakers.   Yet Mr. Clarkson dismissed such fears as largelyxenophobic and short-sighted, maintaining that technology isinevitably &quot;a fleeting thing.&quot; And he said those concernsplayed no part in the Japanese refraining from an equitypartnership, which would have given them practicallyunfettered access to all phases of the project.   &quot;We told them that if they wanted to be equity partners,they would have to put up 25%,&quot; Mr. Clarkson said. &quot;Theythought it was just more than they could handle right now&quot;given their commitments on the FSX, as well as on a recentlystruck, open-ended joint venture agreement between Mitsubishiand Daimler-Benz AG, West Germany's largest industrial group.Officials at the three Japanese companies couldn't be reachedimmediately.   Mr. Clarkson said that while he believes Japan has its eyeon space and will be an important contributor of supersonictransports one day, Japan is content for now to play secondfiddle in the commercial airliner market. &quot;This is not likeselling cars,&quot; he said, citing the ill-fated attempt by Japanin the 1960s to develop a 60-seat propeller plane, the YS-11.   But Clyde Prestowitz Jr., a former senior CommerceDepartment official, attacked such thinking as misguided.&quot;Boeing is either being arrogant, ignorant or just blowingsmoke,&quot; he said.   &quot;Aerospace is probably the Japanese single most importanttarget,&quot; Mr. Prestowitz said, noting that also last week,Japan's Toray Industries Inc. announced that one of itsadvanced carbon-reinforced plastics had been approved byBoeing for use in the primary structure of its aircraft.   Mr. Prestowitz, who now serves as president of theEconomic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank, alsoscoffed at the notion that the Japanese companies or theirgovernment sponsor, the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry, didn't feel comfortable coming up with a 25%position in the 767-X. &quot;They spill a billion dollars atbreakfast,&quot; he said, adding that the Japanese had no troublepledging a 25% stake in the 7J7, a potentially multibilliondollar 1986 venture with Boeing that has been put on the backburner.   But Mr. Clarkson countered that the 350-seat 767-X, whichis bigger than the 767 but smaller than the 747 jumbo jet, isof a different scale than the 150-seat propfan 7J7. In fact,he said, one of the engine casings on the 767-X will be ofroughly the same diameter as the body of the 7J7.   ---   Steve Wilhelm contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
