The Recapitalization Act authorized the former FederalHome Loan Bank Board (``FHLBB'') to charter a corporation known as theFinancing Corporation. The Financing Corporation has issued and will continueto issue debt securities (``Obligations'') in the capital markets, andwith the net proceeds thereof, it has purchased and will continue to purchasecapital certificates. Such capital certificates (along with capital stock)were issued by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (``FSLIC''or ``Corporation'') prior to the enactment of the Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (``FIRREA'') on August 9,1989. Subsequent to enactment of the FIRREA, only capital certificateswill be issued by the FSLIC Resolution Fund. Pursuant to FIRREA the FinancingCorporation is now under the authority of the newly established FederalHousing Finance Board (``Board'') which oversees the twelve (12) Federalhome loan banks (``banks'').The Board today is adopting regulations to clarify the manner in whichthe Financing Corporation will continue its operations and to clarify themanner in which it will exercise its assessment authority with respectto institutions insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (``SAIF'').At the time the Recapitalization Act was enacted, it was not anticipatedthat the provisions of the Act applicable to banks whose contributionsto the Financing Corporation were in excess of the maximum amount limitationset forth in the statute would come into effect. Now, in light of the banks'required contributions to the Resolution Funding Corporation (``FundingCorporation'') and the Financing Corporation, it is necessary to promulgateregulations implementing procedures for ``deficient'' and ``remaining''banks, as such terms are defined in the regulations adopted today. Theother regulations regarding the operations of the Financing Corporationmerely codify, for the most part, FHLBB resolution numbers 87-933, 87-934and 87-935, which granted to the management of a three person directorate(``the Directorate'') of the Financing Corporation the authority to engagein certain operations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>These regulations are effective September 13,1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>K.

General</ITAG>The Recapitalization Act was enacted as Title III of the Competitive Equalityin Banking Act of 1987, Public Law 100-86, 101 Stat. 552. Section 302 ofthe Recapitalization Act amended the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (the ``Act''),12 U.S.C. 1421 <T3>et seq., </T3>by adding a new section 21 concerning the Financing Corporation.The FIRREA, title V, further amends section 21 of the Act by placing theFinancing Corporation under the authority of the Board and by amendingthe Financing Corporation's thrift industry assessment authority.Pursuant to section 21 of the Act, the FHLBB chartered the Financing Corporationon August 28, 1987. The Financing Corporation was, and will continue tobe, under the management of the Directorate. Section 21(b)(8) of the Actprovides that: ``[t]he Directorate shall be subject to such regulations,orders, and directions as the Board may prescribe.'' Additionally, section21(c) of the Act provides that the exercise by the Financing Corporationof its statutory powers shall be subject to such regulations, orders, anddirections as the Board may prescribe. Finally, section 21(j) of the Actauthorizes the Board to ``prescribe such regulations as may be necessaryto carry out the provisions of (section 21) including regulations definingterms used in (section 21).''The Financing Corporation is authorized by the Recapitalization Act, overtime and in series, to issue Obligations having an aggregate outstandingprincipal amount not to exceed $10.825 billion at any one time. The FinancingCorporation, to date, has issued a total of $7.5 billion in Obligations.The net proceeds from the issuance of these Obligations have been usedto purchase nonvoting capital stock and nonredeemable capital certificatesof the FSLIC. As a result of the FIRREA, the Financing Corporation willonly purchase capital certificates of the FSLIC Resolution Fund. The bankshave capitalized and will continue to capitalize the Financing Corporationthrough the purchase of nonvoting capital stock issued by the FinancingCorporation. The Financing Corporation will use these funds to defeaseits outstanding Obligations.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Administrative Expenses</ITAG>In addition to capitalizing the Financing Corporation, the banks shallpay the administrative expenses of the Financing Corporation. Each bankis required to pay an amount determined by multiplying the total administrativecosts for each period by the percentage calculated by dividing_(i) The cumulative amount such bank has paid (or should have paid) to theFinancing Corporation pursuant to section 21(b)(7) of the Act; by(ii) The aggregate of the cumulative amounts the Financing Corporationhas required all banks to pay as of the date of the determination.This determination will not take into account the fact that certain banksmay have actually made the investments in the Financing Corporation contemplatedby section 21(d)(6) of the Act on behalf of another bank whose investmentwould have been in excess of the limitation set forth in section 21(d)(3)of the Act.Annually, the Directorate will seek Board approval for a budget which detailsthe Financing Corporation's expenses for the coming year. The approvedbudget will allow the banks to provide for the anticipated administrativeexpenses included as part of the budget. The Financing Corporation willcoordinate the collection of such administrative expenses from the bankson a periodic basis, but not less often than semi-annually.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Capital Assessments for the Financing Corporation</ITAG>The Financing Corporation has issued Obligations totalling $7.5 billionof the $10.825 billion which the Recapitalization Act authorizes the FinancingCorporation to have outstanding at any one time, and has caused the banksto purchase the necessary capital stock of the Financing Corporation todefease such Obligations. The regulations enacted today detail the mannerin which the banks will continue to be assessed by the Financing Corporationthrough investment in its capital stock. The regulations provide that,without further action by the Board, the banks shall collectively purchase,when and as instructed by the Directorate, an amount of nonvoting capitalstock of the Financing Corporation, which, when added to the amount ofsuch stock previously purchased by the banks, shall not exceed, in theaggregate, the amount necessary to defease $10.825 billion of Obligationsof the Financing Corporation.The regulations promulgated today also codify the par value per share ofFinancing Corporation capital stock at $1.00 and provide that the sharesare only transferable among the banks. In addition, the regulations clarifythat any investment by the banks in the Financing Corporation, in any year,in excess of the three hundred million dollar ($300,000,000) aggregateannual limit on the banks' investments in the stock of the Financing Corporationand the Funding Corporation shall be credited as a payment already madeby the banks in the following year, or years, as the case may be. Therefore,the Directorate shall coordinate with the Oversight Board, establishedpursuant to section 21A of the Act, or its designee the capital contributiondemands of the Financing Corporation and the Funding Corporation.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Establishment, Maintenance and Funding of Reserve Accounts</ITAG>The amount of any bank's allocation of the funds to be provided to capitalizethe Financing Corporation may exceed the maximum amount limitation applicableto such bank under section 21(d)(3) of the Act. In such instances, suchbank will become a ``deficient bank'' and the ``remaining banks'' willbe required to pay, in addition to the amount required under section 21(d)(5)of the Act, a prorated portion of the deficient bank's excess amount. Aremaining bank's prorated portion of the excess amount will be includedin the maximum amount limitation for that bank under section 21(d)(3) ofthe Act, so that a remaining bank will not also become a deficient bank.The regulations promulgated today require that a deficient bank set asidein a reserve account, separate from the reserve accounts required for reimbursementof deficiencies in Funding Corporation contributions, on a quarterly basis,twenty percent (20%) of its net earnings, or the amount of the deficiencyif such deficiency is less than twenty perent (20%) of net earnings. Notwithstandingthe foregoing, the aggregate of the amounts set aside in the reserve accountprovided for herein, and the amounts set aside in the reserve accountsfor deficiencies for Funding Corporation investments and interest payments,shall not be required to exceed twenty percent (20%) of a deficient bank'snet earnings. With respect to deficiencies for Financing Corporation investments,a deficient bank may set aside more than twenty percent (20%) of its netearnings in its reserve account. Until such time as a deficient bank makesits required stock repurchases in the Financing Corporation, such deficientbank is prohibited from making dividend payments of no more than one-halfof its net earnings.A deficient bank shall continue to set funds aside in its reserve accounteach quarter until the deficiency has been repaid. Annually, the Directorateshall direct the disbursement of reserve account funds to the remainingbanks for the sole purpose of purchasing from the remaining banks suchcapital stock of the Financing Corporation as was purchased on behalf ofthe deficient bank. The remaining banks shall be repaid in the order oftheir investments on behalf of a deficient bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Authorization of Establishment of Investment Policies and Procedures</ITAG>The regulations authorize the Directorate to establish investment policiesand procedures from time to time with respect to funds of the FinancingCorporation which are not required to be transferred to the FSLIC ResolutionFund. Such policies and procedures are to be consistent with the provisionsof section 21(g)(1) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Book-Entry Procedure for Financing Corporation Obligations</ITAG>The regulation pertaining to book-entry procedure for Financing CorporationObligations is being removed from 12 CFR part 592, and is being republishedin andSection; 950.5.<ITAG tagnum="84">G. Minority Participation in Public Offerings </ITAG>The Recapitalization Act required the Directorate and the Chairman of theformer FHLBB to take measures to provide an opportunity for minority entitiesto participate to a significant degree in any public offerings of the FinancingCorporation. To fulfill this mandate, the Directorate, has from time totime, adopted procedures to ensure minority participation in such publicofferings. The regulations promulgated today require the Directorate tocontinue to take such measures. <ITAG tagnum="84">H. Industry Assessments </ITAG>a. Assessment Authority Holders of Financing Corporation Obligations are entitled to receive paymentof interest on such Obligations on a semi-annual basis. In order to ensurethat the Financing Corporation will continue to be able to satisfy itsobligation to pay issuance costs, custodian fees, and interest to the holdersof Financing Corporation Obligations, section 21(f) of the Act providesthe Financing Corporation with an income stream. Such income stream iscomprised of the amount of any remaining assessments from FSLIC insuredinstitutions prior to the enactment of FIRREA and the amount of assessmentsagainst SAIF members. To the extent the amounts available from the twoincome sources identified above are insufficient to cover Financing Corporationinterest payments, issuance costs and custodian fees, the liquidating dividendsand payments made on claims of the FSLIC Resolution Fund may be used tomake interest payments. These last amounts are only available if the fundsare not required by the Funding Corporation Principal Fund. Pursuant to its assessment authority under FIRREA, with the approval ofthe Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''),the Financing Corporation may assess each SAIF member, in the manner inwhich the FDIC makes assessments, up to the maximum amount which may beassessed against SAIF members under section 7 of the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1811, <T3>et seq., </T3>(``FDIA''.) The Financing Corporation has first priorityto make these assessments over the other users of SAIF members' insuranceassessments. b. Transition Period The FIRREA requires the FDIC to insure and assess savings associationspreviously insured by the FSLIC. Under prior regulations, each FSLIC insuredinstitution paid an assessment of \1/12\ of 1 percent of its deposit baseand was billed for its assessment amount on the annual anniversary of theinstitution becoming FSLIC insured. FSLIC insured institutions were alsosubject to special annual assessments of up to \1/8\ of 1 percent of theirrespective deposit bases, to be assessed at the FHLBB's discretion. The FDIC assesses its insured institutions in a manner different from thatof the FSLIC. Each FDIC insured institution is required to pay one-halfof its annual assessment on January 31 and the other one-half on July 31.Additionally, FDIC insured institutions were not subject to special assessments,unlike FSLIC insured institutions. As the new insurer of former FSLIC insured institutions, the FDIC mustprovide a mechanism to switch the billing cycles of FSLIC insured institutionsfrom the ``anniversary date'' cycle to the semiannual cycle used by theFDIC. Also, institutions formerly insured by the FSLIC will no longer besubject to special assessments, but will be subject to one assessment ratewhich, during the transition period, is substantially a blend of the formerregular and special assessment rates. The FDIC will coordinate the transitionrules and assessments with the Financing Corporation and the Funding Corporation.To accomplish the transition of SAIF members from the old to the new billingsystem, the FDIC has promulgated regulations set forth at 12 CFR part 327.Such regulations provide for the assessments to be made by the FinancingCorporation during the transition period. As a procedural matter, the FDIC,the Funding Corporation and the Financing Corporation will coordinate thetransition period assessments through a joint collection agent using thedirect debit system. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLBDM)has served as a joint collection agent of the Financing Corporation andthe FSLIC since September 1987, and will continue in this capacity forthe FDIC, the Financing Corporation and the Funding Corporation. The FHLBDMwill collect from each SAIF member an assessment on behalf of the FDIC,the Financing Corporation and the Funding Corporation. This mechanism willensure that the sum of the amounts billed does not exceed the statutorylimitations. c. Post-Transition Regulation Prior to the conclusion of the transition period noted above, the FDICwill promulgate regulations implementing its authority to assess SAIF memberson an on-going basis. Such regulations will take into account the assessmentauthority of the Financing Corporation set forth at section 21(f) of theAct. It is anticipated that the FHLBDM will continue to serve as the jointcollection agent after the transition period.  d. Exit FeesPursuant to section 5(d)(2)(E) of the FDIA, the FDIC and the Secretaryof the Treasury, prior to January 1, 1997, and thereafter the FDIC solely,are to determine the amount of the exit fee to be assessed in the caseof a conversion transaction involving a SAIF member in which the resultingor acquiring institution is not a SAIF member. Such fee is to be depositedin the SAIF, or shall be paid to the Financing Corporation if the Secretaryof the Treasury determines that the Financing Corporation has exhaustedall other sources of funding for interest payments and orders that suchfees be paid to the Financing Corporation. The regulations promulgatedtoday establish the procedure for the Financing Corporation's request forexit fee funds as provided by FIRREA.e. Non-Administrative ExpensesSAIF members are required to fund anticipated non-administrative expensesof the Financing Corporation. Such anticipated non-administrative expensesinclude issuance costs, custodian fees, and interest expenses for the outstandingObligations of the Financing Corporation. Pursuant to the Financing Corporation'sapproved budget and pursuant to its determination as to the amount of interestexpense, the Financing Corporation shall notify the FDIC of the percentageof the semiannual assessment of SAIF members required to meet such anticipatedexpenses. Thereafter, the Financing Corporation shall request such fundsfrom the joint collection agent.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Reports to Board</ITAG>The regulations promulgated today require the Financing Corporation tosubmit quarterly reports to the Board. The purpose of such reports is toallow the Board to monitor the affairs of the Financing Corporation inorder to properly exercise its authority over the Financing Corporation.<ITAG tagnum="84">J. Deletion of Bank Board Regulations</ITAG>Part 592, subchapter H of title V in chapter 12 of the Code of FederalRegulations contains the current operating authority for the FinancingCorporation. This regulation has remained in effect because of the FIRREAsavings provision in section 401(h)(2). Now that the Board is repromulgatingthe Financing Corporation's procedures in 12 CFR part 950, it is no longernecessary to retain the Bank Board's regulations. Part 592 is deleted bythe action taken today.<ITAG tagnum="84">K. Administrative Procedure Act</ITAG>The Board is adopting this regulation as a final rule effective September13, 1989. The Board finds that, for its adoption of these rules, observanceof the notice and comment procedures, prescribed by the AdministrativeProcedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553 (1982) and 12 CFR 508.11 and 508.12 (1987),may be waived pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).The Board for good cause finds that notice and comment procedures are impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest with regard to its adoptionof the Financing Corporation operation rules (12 CFR part 950). The reasonsin support of this finding are as follows:First, the Board is of the view that notice and comment procedures areunnecessary because the rules set forth in part 950, as amended today,generally only codify in the Board's regulations the statutory rules alreadyapplicable under the Recapitalization Act and FIRREA. Therefore, the newrules impose no new legal burden on insured institutions. Similarly, providingnotice and comment procedures and a delayed effective date would be contraryto the public interest because the Board could not immediately dischargeits statutory responsibilities.Secondly, the Board believes that it is contrary to the public interestto have the adoption of the rules delayed in order to provide for suchnotice and comment procedures. The Board finds that it is in the publicinterest for the Financing Corporation to continue its operations and tohave the banks' investments and investment limits clearly established.In connection with this finding, the Board notes that further funds raisedby the Financing Corporation will be contributed to the capital of theFSLIC Resolution Fund. The Financing Corporation's contributions to theFSLIC Resolution Fund's capital will permit the maintenance of public confidencein the nation's depository institutions and will enable the FSLIC ResolutionFund to meet its obligations under FIRREA.Finally, the Board finds that these regulations relate to agency managementwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553 and are therefore exempt from the noticeand comment provisions set forth therein.<ITAG tagnum="84">L. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this regulation,the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) do not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 592 and 950</ITAG>Federal home loan banks, Financing Corporation, Resolution Funding Corporation,Savings Associations, Securities.Accordingly, the Board hereby amends title 12, chapters V and IX, Codeof Federal Regulations as set forth below:1.
