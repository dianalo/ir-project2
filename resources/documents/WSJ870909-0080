Surma, said at a news conference after the union made its presentation. &quot;We're looking it over and have indicated we would be getting back to them.&quot;    The proposal &quot;at this point provides for an absolute guarantee&quot; of current employment levels regardless of circumstances such as a drop in sales, UAW President Owen Bieber said at a separate news conference. Sources have said, however, that the union may be willing to compromise on that point as bargaining progresses.    Mr. Bieber said the exact number of jobs guaranteed during the three-year contract would depend on the reference date, but said it could be as high as 107,000 workers. In 1979, Ford employed 190,000 hourly workers. Positions created in the future also would be covered by the guarantee.    In addition, the union is asking for a renewal of the 1984 ban on plant closings, and a moratorium on outsourcing -- the transfer of work to other companies -- Mr. Bieber said.    The current contract expires at midnight Monday. The talks heated up last week, when the union picked Ford over General Motors Corp. as its target for a settlement or possible strike. GM negotiations are currently on hold, and the union will try and get a pact there similar to the Ford contract.    In Toronto, Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit said it plans to make a contract offer today to the Canadian Auto Workers union. The union said it expects Chrysler's proposal to address pivotal economic issues, including wages and pension benefits. Last week, the Canadian union picked Chrysler as its target for a contract settlement or strike. The union's current contracts with the Canadian units of the Big Three auto makers, including Chrysler Canada Ltd., expire at midnight Monday. </TEXT></DOC>
