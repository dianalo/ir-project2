The negotiations could lead to a European joint venture, reflecting Texaco's intentions to sell assets partly by placing them in new joint ventures. The proceeds from any asset shedding will help finance Texaco's settlement with Pennzoil and its plan to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.    Texaco is expected to announce details of a restructuring plan soon, perhaps as early as today in connection with a scheduled meeting of its board, said a source close to the company. The source said the restructuring program will include asset write-downs and other special charges that might be recorded against the company's fourth-quarter earnings.    Texaco's largest shareholder, investor Carl Icahn, who owns 12.3% of Texaco's stock, has been clamoring for the company to be &quot;seriously restructured or sold&quot; as a way of bolstering Texaco's long-depressed share value.    &quot;Management has to show it's in charge,&quot; said the source close to the company.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco closed at $38.875 a share, up $1.    Texaco officials have long promised to launch a major restructuring effort but have refused until now to disclose any details of the plan. The White Plains, N.Y., oil giant has said it will sell some assets to help finance a $3 billion payment to Pennzoil Co. to settle the companies' long and bitter $10.3 billion litigation. The companies' settlement agreement, reached last month, is the cornerstone of Texaco's proposed Chapter 11 reorganization plan, in which it will pay an additional $2.6 billion to other creditors.    Two people close to Texaco said that while Texaco, as part of its restructuring, is likely to sell assets, including certain U.S. refining operations that would be identified within the next few months, some of the assets might be contributed to ventures that Texaco would operate jointly with partners. Such a strategy would enable the company to maintain a foothold in major marketing and refining areas. A leading candidate to become a joint-venture partner is Petroleos de Venezuela, whose talks with Texaco are &quot;fairly well advanced,&quot; one of the sources said.    A highly placed official of the Venezuelan national company said his concern is interested in establishing equal partnerships with any number of oil companies in the U.S. and Europe. &quot;We are interested in a whole range of possibilities, and it's obvious we are looking at companies which have refineries,&quot; the official said. Petroleos de Venezuela already has established joint refining ventures with Southland Corp. and Union Pacific Corp. in the U.S. and with Veba AG in West Germany.    Venezuela, in fact, is but one oil exporter coveting refining assets of other oil companies -- including those of Texaco. In a recent interview, James Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive officer, said Kuwaiti oil officials recently have expressed interest in looking at any Texaco assets that might be for sale, although Mr. Kinnear indicated that no serious talks have been held.    Speculation about the sale of Texaco assets has centered on its controlling interest in Texaco Canada Ltd., in which Husky Oil Ltd. and at least two other suitors have expressed interest, and on Texaco's half of a joint venture with Chevron Corp., in which the companies operate a refining and marketing business in the Far East under the trade name Caltex. But Mr. Kinnear has said that Texaco wishes to sell only underperforming assets, and both Texaco Canada and Caltex are among the company's most profitable operations.    However, sources close to the company say Texaco management is still considering selling its 78% stake in Texaco Canada because it can be easily sold and would raise a lot of money. And although Caltex isn't high on the list of assets Texaco would like to sell, it hasn't completely ruled it out. Chevron has the right of first refusal on Texaco's half of Caltex, and Chevron Chairman George Keller has said he would be interested in purchasing it. According to a source close to Texaco, there is at least one major U.S. oil company ready to challenge Chevron, and it's waiting in the wings with its own bid.    Saudi Arabia also is seriously, but discreetly, seeking refining and marketing operations in the U.S. The Saudis also seem to prefer a joint-venture approach similar to Venezuela's rather than an outright acquisition. When asked what companies Saudi Arabia would be interested in, Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said, &quot;We are talking to everybody.&quot;    ---   Caleb Solomon contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
