The State Department said that the proposal, which was submitted yesterday at the arms-control talks in Geneva, reflects &quot;a different set of circumstances&quot; following Soviet acceptance last month of the U.S. proposal that both superpowers totally eliminate these weapons systems in Europe and Asia. Previously, each side had talked about keeping a force of 100 medium-range warheads, which the U.S. insisted would require more stringent verification procedures.    But other administration officials said another reason for the changed position is that U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as European allies, objected to the idea of Soviet inspection teams having access to Western military facilities. The Soviets traditionally have opposed on-site inspections, but recently surprised American officials by agreeing to proposals for such inspections. Yesterday, U.S. officials said they believe the Soviets will accept the latest proposal.    Nevertheless, the new U.S. proposal doesn't clear the way for an arms pact with Moscow. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday reiterated his complaint that American and West German insistence on retaining 72 Pershing 1-A missiles, based in West Germany, is a stumbling block to an agreement. The German missiles have American warheads, which Moscow argues should be part of the arms-destruction agreement under negotiation.    Also yesterday, stepping up his arms-control public relations campaign, Mr. Gorbachev proposed that the United Nations Security Council meet to discuss how money saved by disarmament could be spent on economic development.    Mr. Reagan's new inspection proposal has created fresh tensions with conservatives, who, distrustful of the Soviets, have pushed hard for stringent verification procedures. The plan to cut back on inspections is &quot;a major retreat from the strong position the president has taken in the past,&quot; said James Hackett, an arms-control expert at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy organization.    Earlier this month, Mr. Reagan infuriated hardliners when he announced a bipartisan Central America peace plan that linked a suspension of U.S. aid to the Contra rebels to a cease-fire and certain political reforms in leftist Nicaragua. Conservatives view the plan, as well as a subsequent regional peace plan proposed in Guatemala and tentatively endorsed by the administration, as a sellout of the insurgents.    The president, in a 20-minute speech today in Los Angeles, is expected to specify benchmark actions he wants from the Soviets to demonstrate the credibility of their interest in relieving world tensions. The speech will ask the Soviets, among other things, to withdraw from Afghanistan, dismantle the Berlin Wall and allow self-determination in Europe.    The administration said it made two major changes in the on-site inspection proposal, first disclosed in Monday's Washington Post. It altered a &quot;suspect site inspection proposal&quot; under which either side could have inspected any facility if it believed a violation had occurred. Under the new proposal, such inspections would be limited to certain ground-launched ballistic missile facilities in the U.S. or Russia.    The new proposal also drops the requirement for regular monitoring of production and assembly facilities for medium and short-range missiles.    However, officials noted that several procedures remain and would be used to verify any agreement, including an exchange of data on the location of missile-support facilities, initial &quot;baseline&quot; inspections to verify the number of missiles at a facility, and on-site inspections to verify the destruction of missiles. The U.S. plan calls for the elimination of medium-range missiles over three years and shorter-range missiles within a year.    State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley yesterday insisted that the U.S. hasn't &quot;softened or backed off&quot; on verification measures. Administration officials have broadly hinted in recent weeks that on-site inspections weren't nearly as important in a treaty in which the Soviets agreed to eliminate all, rather than most, intermediate-range missiles. At a breakfast with reporters recently, National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci said that verification is &quot;infinitely&quot; easier under such a treaty.    ---   Gerald F.
