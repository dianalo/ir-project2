A group of 190 producers have already rejected threepricing proposals as too low and turned down a plan to handover talks to arbitrators. A fourth offer is expected toreach producers today. The most recent pricing agreementexpired at midnight last night.</LP><TEXT>   Without the extension, San Francisco-based Pacific Gas andamp;Electric Co. and its gas procurement arm, Alberta andamp; SouthernGas Co. of Calgary, would have had to pay up to 1 millionCanadian dollars (US$868,280) in fines daily to keep gasflowing to northern California. About one billion cubic feetof Canadian gas is shipped to California daily, meeting 50%of Pacific Gas's needs.   It is the second time in as many years that Pacific Gasand its Canadian suppliers have needed an extension to workout an acceptable gas price.   While gas prices have fallen as much as 50% across NorthAmerica, many Canadian producers say California regulatorsand Pacific Gas are taking advantage of low prices forshort-term supplies to force long-term suppliers to takehefty cuts as well.   Pacific Gas's original proposal called for an averageprice of $1.30 per thousand cubic feet of gas, which wasraised to $1.50 in subsequent offers. In the contract yearjust ended, Pacific Gas paid an average of $1.80 per thousandcubic feet for Canadian gas.   &quot;We expect the fourth offer to be raised about 5 or 10cents, to $1.55 or $1.60,&quot; says J.C. Anderson, chairman andchief executive officer of Calgary-based Anderson ExplorationLtd. &quot;That's probably still too low, but it could getapproved. Everyone's fed up.&quot;   Anderson Exploration sells more than 70% of its gasproduction to California, with those sales generating about80% of the company's revenue. Mr. Anderson says he believesRick Orman, Alberta's energy minister, should have consideredcutting off gas supplies to California once the pricingagreement expired.   Pacific Gas &quot;has to get some of their gas from Canada,they can't make up those volumes anywhere else,&quot; Mr. Andersonsaid. &quot;If the gas quit flowing, it would make them think.&quot;   Other producers say Mr. Orman was right to extend theagreement and that the next price offer could be the finalone.   &quot;We're resigned,&quot; said Jack Sandercock, manager ofresources for Shell Canada Ltd. of Calgary. &quot;You have to facereality, the market is soft. At Shell, we accept we have tobe in the market and we'll do what we have to to becompetitive.&quot;   Some gas producers said an offer could be acceptable ifthe average price is about $1.60 per thousand cubic feetwithout any changes being made to the minimum amount of gasthe company agrees to buy.   In 1990, Alberta shipped C$800 million of natural gas toCalifornia under the long-term contracts. A spokesman forAlberta andamp; Southern said the company is preparing a new priceoffer to be made to producers. He declined to discussdetails, but said it has been designed in response tofeedback from producers.</TEXT></DOC>
