In a study, the blood test proved more accurate indetecting cancer than a rectal examination, the standardmethod doctors use to diagnose the disease. In seven out of10 cases, rectal exams fail to discover the disease until ithas spread to other parts of the body. The blood testincreases the chances of detecting prostate cancer 20%, theresearchers said. In combination with a rectal exam, itincreases the chances 34%.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, the blood test may make preventive exams muchmore common because it is more acceptable to many patientsthan rectal exams. Some researchers urge that the blood testbe used for early detection of prostate cancer, much asmammograms are used to screen for breast cancer in women.   &quot;It's a valuable new tool for diagnosing prostate cancer,an area where we're not doing very well,&quot; says William J.Catalona, chief of urologic surgery at Washington UniversitySchool of Medicine and Barnes Hospital, St. Louis. He saysall men age 50 and over should have annual blood tests tocheck for prostate cancer. He and his colleagues report onthe test in today's New England Journal of Medicine.   But doctors are divided over how effective any broadscreening program might be. It isn't known, for instance,whether early detection of the disease will lead totreatments that actually prolong life. Moreover, some studiesbased on autopsies show that more than 30% of men over 50have evidence of prostate cancer that remains latent andnever causes clinical problems. Some researchers worry thatscreening programs might pick up many of these men.   &quot;The detection of such tumors exposes these patients tothe risks of treatment without any potential for benefit,&quot;Gerald W. Chodak and Glenn S. Gerber of the University ofChicago School of Medicine said last month in the Journal ofthe National Cancer Institute.   About 100,000 cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed inthe U.S. each year, and about 30,000 men die annually of thedisease. One in 10 men will develop the cancer at some point;the risk increases with age, and among men with other familymembers with the disease. Remedies include surgical removalof the prostate as well as hormonal and radiation treatmentsand chemotherapy.   One big reason the disease often goes undetected until ithas spread, Dr. Catalona says, is that &quot;most men arereluctant to have a rectal exam&quot; unless they already havesymptoms. But most people readily accept blood tests forcholesterol levels, for instance, and he thinks that theblood test will make preventive exams much more acceptablefor prostate cancer.   But, he emphasized, &quot;the test is not a substitute -- itshould be used in combination with a rectal exam.&quot; Nor is itperfect. It is only an indicator of problems -- a biopsy isrequired to determine whether cancer is present -- and itmisses some abnormalities that show up in rectal exams orwith ultrasound, another diagnostic tool. In the study, itmissed 20% of the cancers that were present and showed falsepositives in 16% of cases -- a significant error rate thatlends support to those who say the evidence doesn't back up abroad screening effort.   Nearly 2,000 men were included in the study, financed inpart by Hybritech Inc., a San Diego, Calif., company thatmakes the blood test. The test is used to monitor theprogress of prostate cancer, and some doctors already use itin diagnosis.   Researchers took blood tests of 1,653 healthy men over 50,with no evidence of cancer or benign prostate disease, andmeasured levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, aprotein produced by prostate cells. PSA is produced ingreater quantity as the prostate increases in size,indicating that cancer may be present. Results were comparedwith those for 300 men who had undergone biopsies to examineabnormal prostate tissue and who served as experimentalcontrols.   The researchers found that 92% of the 1,653 men in thestudy had normal PSA levels; 6%, or 107 men, had mildlyelevated levels; and 2%, or 30, had high levels. Overall, 112men had biopsies, of whom 37, or 33% had cancer.   A high PSA level was a major predictor of cancer: 22% ofmen with mildly elevated levels, and 67% of those with highlevels, had cancer. Men with elevated PSA but no cancer hadbenign prostate disease or inflammation of the gland.   The researchers said that among the 37 men with cancer, arectal exam alone missed 12, or one-third, of the cancers.Ultrasound alone missed 43%, they said.   The blood test &quot;is not going to detect every prostatecancer out there,&quot; Dr. Catalona said, &quot;but it will be a lotbetter than it is now.&quot; He said that if widely used, perhapsseven in 10 cases could be detected before they spread beyondthe prostate itself.   Though he acknowledged that no study has proved earlydetection will prolong life, prostate tumors, like those inthe breast in women, grow relatively slowly -- meaning earlytreatment has a chance to be more effective. &quot;Logic tells youthat the reason prostate cancer is a major killer is becauseit's picked up late,&quot; he says.   The National Cancer Institute plans a major study of theeffectiveness of screening and early treatment, but resultswon't be known until late in the next decade.</TEXT></DOC>
