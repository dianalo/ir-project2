(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A defense company, two former executivesand a defense consultant pleaded guilty Tuesday to bribing a MarineCorps official in a scheme to get electronic contracts worth $7.7million.   Whittaker Command and Control Systems, a Whittaker Corp.subsidiary, agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines and penalties forits part in the scheme to bribe Marine Corps contracting officialJack Sherman.   Guilty pleas were also entered by Scott M. Lamberth, formerpresident of the Whittaker subsidiary, John F. Van Tassel, theoperations director of its Fayetteville, Ark., facility and SanDiego defense consultant Donald Illeman. All three men agreed tocooperate with the FBI's continuing investigation dubbed``Operation Ill Wind.''   A federal grand jury investigating the case, meanwhile, indicteddefense consultant Thomas E. Muldoon and another former WhittakerCommand executive, Leonard L. Ingram, on charges of participatingin the same bribery scheme.   Muldoon, targeted by investigators as an important figure in thecase, and Ingram were charged in the 16-count indictment withconspiracy, bribery and interstate travel in aid of racketeering.   In its guilty plea, the company admitted funneling more than$80,000 to Sherman between 1982 and 1988 through three defenseconsultants, including Illeman. The scandal stemmed from theawarding and expansion of contracts to provide electroniccomponents for a battlefield air traffic control system.   The guilty plea by Whittaker Command and Control Systems is thethird by a corporation in the continuing investigation of Pentagaonprocurement fraud that has resulted in convictions of more than 20officials, consultants and businessmen.   Teledyne Electronics and Hazeltine Corp. have both pleadedguilty for their roles in the procurement scandal.   According to a company lawyer and court papers, Whittaker Corp.officials were unaware of the bribery scheme, which began when thesubsidiary was a private company called Lee Telecommunications.   The bribery scheme was conceived in 1981 when LeeTelecommunications started having financial troubles, according tocourt papers filed in the case in U.S. District Court.   Whittaker Corp. acquired Lee Telecommunications in 1986, latermerging it with another subsidiary to form Whittaker Command andControl Systems. Lamberth and Ingram were stockholders of LeeTelecommunications and became, respectively, president and vicepresident of the Whittaker subsidiary.   Lamberth, 59, deliberately hid the bribery scheme from officialsof the parent company after the acquisition, the court papers said.   ``The board of directors and the present officers of the companydo not have first-hand knowledge of he facts,'' Whittaker'sattorney Daniel H. Bookin told U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton.   ``No one who is involved in those activities is currently withthe company,'' Bookin said, but the corporate officers ``seesufficient evidence to conclude that a guilty plea is appropriate.''   Sherman, who received an 18-month prison term for taking otherbribes, helped Lee Telecommunications get a $600,000 contract in1982 to build computers for the battlefield traffic-control system.He subsequently authorized several modifications that increased itsvalue to more than $2.6 million, according to court papers.   He also increased the value of another contract from $540,000 to$3.6 million by authorizing additional work. Sherman laterauthorized the transfer of a $1.6 million worth of additionalcomputer software work to Lee Telecommunications from a firm thatcould not perform its contract.   Lamberth faces a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to$500,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery.   Illeman, 64, and Van Tassel, 53, could each be sentenced up to15 years and fined $250,000 for their pleas to bribery charges.   Hilton scheduled sentencing for Lamberth and Van Tassel on Dec.15 and for Illeman on Jan. 12.   The indictment charged that the company paid more than $200,000to Muldoon, Illeman and another defense consultant, John Marlowe,who is cooperating with the government, to share with Sherman.   Ingram is accused in the indictment of submitting _ after the``Ill Wind'' investigation became public _ a phony invoice to theMarine Corps to obtain reimbursement for $30,000 paid to Illeman,who told investigators he shared part of it with Sherman.   Muldoon's attorney, Albert Ahern Jr., said his client refused agovernment offer to plead guilty, and will fight the charges incourt. ``Muldoon denies it all, denies there was any criminalintent on his part at any time,'' Ahern said.   Ingram's attorney, Marcus Topel, vowed to fight the charges incourt. ``I think this is a classic case of guilt by association,''the San Francisco lawyer said. ``I think the trial will show he hadabsolutely nothing to do with any of these wrongful activities, andat most was present at various times when they were discussed anddid nothing further than that.''</TEXT></DOC>
