The company said the two-month-long dispute restricted delivery of merchandise to Philadelphia area customers and will result in &quot;significantly&quot; lower revenue in the first quarter ended yesterday.    It said it also expects the dispute to have &quot;a negative impact&quot; on the unit's and company's fiscal first-quarter operating results. A spokesman wouldn't elaborate.    The company, which also designs and makes electronic devices and energy conversion equipment and produces fiber-optic cable, said it expects to regain some of the lost revenue during the second quarter.    In the year-earlier period, the company earned $325,000, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $14.8 million. </TEXT></DOC>
