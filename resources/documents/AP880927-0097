SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 1990 Census, with a price tag someestimate as high as $3 billion, may have problems hiring enoughworkers to do the massive national head count, Census Director JohnG. Keane said Tuesday.   Keane told the House census and population subcommittee that hegenerally is optimistic about plans for the 1990 count. But heexpressed concern over hiring 300,000 part-time workers, as well asover the general attitude of the populace toward surveys andcensuses.   On nights when he can't sleep, Keane said, ``I wonder if Censuscan get enough good people to work well enough and long enough in1990.''   The problems will vary from area to area, and regions with astrong economy and many two-worker families will have few peopleavailable to take temporary or part-time jobs at pay ranging from$5.50 an hour, he explained.   ``One of the bureau's major management challenges ... isacquiring and retaining a sufficient number of competent temporaryemployees,'' agreed Gene L. Dodaro of the congressional GeneralAccounting Office, also appearing before the subcommittee of theHouse Post Office and Civil Service Committee.   In 1980 there were times when the bureau could fill only 70percent of its openings in many areas, Dodaro said, particularly inlarge cities such as New York, Dallas, Philadelphia and Denver.   Thus far, Dodaro noted, the Census Bureau has been on scheduleand under budget in its planning and dress rehearsals for the 1990count, despite occasional technical problems.   Dodaro warned, though, that with inflation the overall cost ofthe 1990 count could top $3 billion.   The Census Bureau has estimated the census will cost about $2.6billion, well over twice the $1.1 billion it cost to count thenation in 1980.   But Dodaro said he expects the final costs to outrun theplanning estimates.   In addition to hiring, Keane expressed concern about Americans'attitude toward being counted.   ``The climate has deteriorated in this nation for takingcensuses and surveys. How much it has deteriorated, we don'tknow,'' Keane said. He cited as problems ``junk mail, junk phonecalls and sometimes questionable door-to-door businesses.''   For most of the nation, the Census will come in the mail,although Census takers will visit many homes in rural areas wheregood mailing lists are not available.   Congress is considering legislation requiring the bureau toadjust its final figures to compensate for people who may be missedin the national head count.   The bureau has resisted this in the past, contending that itcould not produce accurate estimates of people who are missed andwarning that changing the count would damage public confidence inthe numbers.   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., asked how the bureau wouldrespond if the bill passes.   ``If ordered to do something we would do the best we could underthe circumstances. It might not be as good as some would like,''said Peter Bounpane, who is directing planning for the 1990 count.   Asked about a bill to require the bureau to count militarypersonnel overseas for purposes of congressional reapportionment,Bounpane said that poses some problems.   Counting those people and asking their home state can be done,he explained, but it isn't always easy to assign military people toa hometown within a state. Thus, a state population total could addup to more than the sum of all the local populations in the state,and that can cause difficulty in drawing congressional districtlines within a state, Bounpane said.   Counting illegal aliens in the Census has also become apolitical question, but Keane explained that the bureau must countthem. The Constitution and the 1790 Census law require the agencyto count everyone residing in the United States, he explained, notjust citizens.</TEXT></DOC>
