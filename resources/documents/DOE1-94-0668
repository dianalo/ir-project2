Generation methods for saturated vapor atmospheresand exposure systems are described. The determination of the nominalconcentration gives in most cases sufficient information on the concentrationin the inhalation atmosphere. The temperature at which the saturationoccurs and the exposure time are parameters which influence the testresults. The determination of the LT/sub 0/ (the exposure time at whichno animals die) is used to compare substances with different inhalationhazards. A classification system is proposed to differentiate the toxichazard of volatile substances. The IHT is an appropriate method to characterizethe acute inhalation hazard of volatile substances. It requires feweranimals and is less elaborate than the LC/sub 50/.</TEXT></DOC>
