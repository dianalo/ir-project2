The climb last month in the Labor Department's Producer PriceIndex wiped out consecutive price declines of 0.4 percent in Augustand July and 0.1 percent in June.   The September reversal brought the annual wholesale inflationrate for the first nine months of the year to 5.1 percent andmarked a return to the high inflation of the early part of the year.   Although wholesale inflation is not nearly as bad as fearedafter prices advanced at a 10.1 percent annual rate in the firstquarter, it is still significantly higher than the 4.0 percent rateposted in all of 1988.   Contributing to the big September jump was a statistical glitchin the measurement of auto prices, which were skewed becausemanufacturers offered their end-of-the-model-year price incentivesearlier in the summer than usual.   When month-to-month increases were adjusted for normal seasonalvariations, auto prices rose 3.8 percent in September. Whenseasonal adjustments are factored out, auto prices actuallydeclined 0.5 percent.   ``We were due for a big rebound ... after several months ofdeclines,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. ``... Iwould not be particularly alarmed about this one-month spike upgiven the seasonal effect in autos and the spike in energy, whichwill probably be a one-time event.''   The stock market at first showed little reaction to the news aswell as to a separate report showing stronger-than-expected retailsales last month. But by noon, the Dow Jones average of 30industrial stocks fell 19.88 points to 2739.96. Traders interpretedthe reports as a sign the Federal Reserve would not soon lowerinterest rates.   According to a Labor Department analyst, roughly 0.8 percentagepoints of the 0.9 percent monthly rise in the inflation index wasattributable to motor vehicles and energy.   Energy prices, which had fallen in June, July and August, shotup 6.5 percent last month. Fuel oil rose 16.3 percent; gasoline,10.6 percent, and natural gas, 3.4 percent.   In good news, the department said food prices dropped 0.6percent. Vegetables were down 16.1 percent; turkeys, 4.9 percent;pasta, 4.4 percent; and beef, 4.0 percent. Prices for pork, fish,fruit and rice also fell.   Excluding the usually volatile food and energy categories,prices rose 0.7 percent in September following a 0.5 percentincrease in August.   The cost of home furnishings, health products, magazines, floorcoverings, tobacco and alcoholic beverages all rose.   In another economic report today, the Commerce Department saidretail sales rose 0.5 percent in September, the seventh consecutivemonth without a decline. Overall sales increased to a seasonallyadjusted $145.2 billion last month following a 0.7 percent gain inAugust and a revised 0.7 percent rise in July.   The 0.9 percent gain in the overall wholesale price index leftit at 113.5, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing$100 in 1982 would have cost $113.50 last month. In advance, manyeconomists were predicting a 0.7 percent or 0.8 percent rise.   The return of wholesale inflation in September was likely todampen financial market speculation that the Federal Reserve Boardwould soon lower interest rates.   Traders had been hoping the central bank would cut rates to curbthe rise in the value of the dollar, which is hurting U.S. chancesto improve its trade deficit.   However, in a speech at a conference in Washington on Thursdaynight, Fed Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson said, ``We have to focusour attention in monetary policy on domestic inflationaryimplications.''   The inflation news was not particularly encouraging in Septembermeasures of prices earlier in the production process. Intermediategoods rose 0.4 percent after three successive drops and crude goodsjumped 1.1 percent. Examples of the three processing stages _finished, intermediate and crude _ are bread, flour and wheat.   The Federal Reserve in recent months has been walking atightrope, hoping to keep interest rates high enough to dampeninflationary pressures but low enough to avoid a recession, saidWashington economic consultant Michael K. Evans.   The Fed fought inflationary pressures through this spring bydriving short-term interest rates up. Then, after signs of economicsoftness emerged, the central bank eased a bit in June and July.But it has since held steady as a string of economic reportsportrayed a resilient economy.   Last week, in the first broad look at economic activity inSeptember, the Labor Department reported manufacturing lost 103,000jobs _ the biggest drop in seven years _ as the unemployment rateedged up from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent.   Many analysts took the report as a sign of renewed weakness,possibly giving the Fed room to lower interest rates further. ButEvans said the Fed is still concerned that inflation is too high.   ``The Fed is going to say `If there are signs of softness,that's too bad. Our first priority is to beat back inflation,''' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
