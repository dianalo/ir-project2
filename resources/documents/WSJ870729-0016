In secondary markets, prices of most Eurodollar bonds were little changed. Participation has declined because of the summer holiday season, dealers said, and U.S. Treasury bonds traded within a narrow range, lending little direction.    Dealers lauded the 3% coupon indicated by Mitsubishi Metal Corp., a large smelter of non-ferrous metals, on its $300 million of Eurobonds with equity-purchase warrants, and the 3 1/4% coupon indicated by Showa Denko K.K., a chemical producer, on its $200 million of such bonds.    Both issues were similar in other terms, with five-year maturities and par prices. But they offered coupons about a point higher than the coupons on some other recent issues. That helped them get a much better reception than other recent offerings, dealers said, although demand centered on the warrants, which can be traded separately.    Mitsubishi Metal's issue was led by Nikko Securities Co. (Europe) Ltd.; Showa Denko's was led by Nomura International Ltd. Demand generally remains muted for equity-linked bonds by Japanese companies because of the volatility in Japanese equity markets, bankers said.    Showa Denko, in particular, took pains to boost demand for its issue, according to syndicators. In moves uncharacteristic of Japanese borrowers, Showa Denko officials gave advance presentations in Europe and consulted with Eurobond participants about the terms and timing of the offering, even delaying it for a week until the Tokyo market firmed.    SmithKline Beckman Corp., the U.S. pharmaceutical concern, found modest demand for its $100 million of 8 3/4%, five-year Eurobonds. &quot;The Eurodollar bond market, like other fixed-coupon markets, isn't having the easiest time of it,&quot; said an official at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., the lead manager. &quot;We've had some good sales on the Continent, particularly in Switzerland, but not much interest elsewhere.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
