Late Wednesday, the rebels reiterated that they were willing toparticipate in a cease-fire in fighting that began 11 days earlier,providing the first steps toward fundmental political, social andeconomic reform be made. They also demanded internationalverification.   There was no immediate reaction from El Salvador's right-winggovernment.   On Wednesday morning, the U.S. soldiers, carrying their luggage,rifles and grenades, ran from the hotel when the rebels apparentlyabandoned it. Waiting police pickup trucks then sped off with theminside.   The raid on the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel began before dawnTuesday as part of a larger attack on the capital's wealthiestneighborhood. Numerous foreign guests, including the chief of theOrganization of American States, were evacuated, but the GreenBerets remained until Wednesday morning.   President Bush said Wednesday an elite Army unit ``liberated thehotel,'' but the administration said later the special unit neverentered the building.   Reporters who spent the morning with the soldiers saw no specialoperation, although security was heavy around the hotel andincluded a few U.S. soldiers.   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said 12 Green Berets and threecivilians were trapped inside the hotel overnight.   The El Salvador Sheraton is not now part of the U.S.-based chain.   Union chief Felix Blanco, secretary-general of the 40,000Salvadoran Worker's Central, asked the nation's guerrillas onWednesday to ``forget the armed struggle,'' saying the war impededeconomic progress for the common people.   Blanco spoke in Caracas, Venezuela, where he was attending aworld labor conference and where President Carlos Andres Perez waspreparing to meet Salvadoran guerrilla leaders on Thursday to tryto stop the fighting.   Perez has scheduled talks with representatives of the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, the coalition ofguerrilla armies in El Salvador.   The FMLN late Wednesday expressed its ``immediate acceptance''of a truce that, if agreed, would be monitored by U.N.peacekeepers. The communique was mainly a reiteration of therebels' negotiating position during two sessions of peace talksearlier this year that had ended in deadlock.   However, it also indicated that the rebels renewed their demandto negotiate directly with the armed forces. They had earlier givenup their insistence of an armed forces presence on the governmentdelegation, saying the move was a concession indicating flexibility.   The Green Berets told reporters before leaving that they neverconsidered themselves hostages, although they barricaded themselvesbehind mattresses. They said they never exchanged fire with theguerrillas.   Walker and Bush said the Salvadoran government negotiated forthe soldiers' release, but the Green Berets said most of the rebelassault force simply walked out of the building at dusk Tuesday.   The hotel facade was sprayed with thousands of bullets. TwoSalvadoran bodyguards of OAS chief Joao Baena Soares were killed.   ``We're all OK. We got some sleep during the night, but therewas sporadic firing,'' said one U.S. soldier.   All the guerrillas had abandoned the building by dawn, althoughisolated shots indicated a lone rebel sniper may have remained inthe area after daybreak.   The soldiers, dressed in sneakers, jeans and sport shirts orT-shirts, waited three more hours to make their dash.   The Green Berets declined to give their names but confirmed theywere from Fort Bragg, N.C., and were in El Salvador on a 13-daytraining mission.   U.S. advisers who spend less than two weeks here are not countedin the 55-trooper limit on military advisers set by Congress.   The raid was the latest act of an 11-day offensive by the FMLN.The day broke without heavy gunfire or air attacks for the firsttime since Nov. 11. At least 1,000 people have been killed in theoffensive.   Guerrilla chiefs said Tuesday in Escalon the objective was totake control of the zone around the hotel as a demonstration ofstrength to Baena Soares, who was in El Salvador on a peace mission.   The guerrilla assault began at 4 a.m. (5 a.m. EST) Tuesday whenat least 100 rebels entered the western neighborhood of Escalon.   They established tentative control around the Sheraton, butgovernment troops backed by tanks surrounded the area.   That frustrated a guerrilla plan for Facundo Guardado, a toprebel army leader, to meet personally with Baena Soares, guerrillaleaders said.   Baena Soares, a Brazilian, was trapped for hours before beingevacuated by an armored personnel carrier. He then flew toWashington.   The guerrilla action _ besides bringing the war to the frontdoors of the rich and partially destroying a four-star hotel _appeared to achieve little.   The capital was almost completely quiet Wednesday and reports ofcalm from the provinces indicated the Escalon assault might havebeen the offensive's last gasp.   Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of SanSalvador, said a church delegation would meet with PresidentAlfredo Cristiani and with guerrillas in mediation efforts.   More than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in thecivil war.</TEXT></DOC>
