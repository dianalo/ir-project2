(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At least five groups of Insilco Corp.shareholders have filed suit against the company, seeking to thwarta $950 million management-led leveraged buyout they consider``grossly unfair and inadequate.''   Insilco's board of directors accepted the $29-a-share offerearlier this month in what some analysts described as ananti-takeover defense for the high-technology and specialtyconsumer products concern.   In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely withboreowed money repaid from the target company's profits or assetsales.   Stockholders want to prevent that deal from being completed. Incomplaints filed in New Haven Superior Court, they charge Insilcowould be worth a lot more in ``an open auction for the company.''   ``The directors have the duty to maximize shareholder value,''William Barnes, an attorney for Sam and Marilyn Pill of Brooklyn,N.Y., wrote in one of five civil suits filed Tuesday.   Insilco disclosed in filings with the Securities and ExchangeCommission last week that it received several unsolicited buyoutoffers since the management bid. It said it entered intoconfidentiality agreements with certain groups but declined toidentify the parties.   Insilco Vice President and Treasurer Malcolm Todt said Thursdaythe company believes the tender offer from management is fair.   Named as defendants were Insilco, 12 directors and ISC HoldingsInc., the new holding company created by Insilco management toacquire the Meriden-based company.   In recent years, Insilco, once known as the International SilverCo., has restructured itself into an industrial holding companywith operating companies that make products for high-technologyindustries and speciality consumer markets.   Insilco makes Red Devil paints, Rolodex rotary files, metalcartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry andDual-Lite emergency lighting equipment.   Insilco earned $11.7 million, or 55 cents per share, in thesecond quarter, compared with $11 million, or 52 cents a share,last year. Revenue totaled $196.4 million, up from $154.3 million.</TEXT></DOC>
