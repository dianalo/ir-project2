Richard Secord, says SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell.   The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on why some WhiteHouse documents on the Iran-Contra affair were not turned over toCongress does not warrant reopening the overall inquiry, Mitchellsaid Sunday.   ``There is no basis at this time, in my judgment, for aresumption of the investigation or for the creation of a newinvestigation,'' Mitchell said.   ``Obviously, there are loose ends,'' he said in an interview onNBC's ``Meet the Press.''   ``Not every single question has been answered and every one maynot be answered,'' said the majority leader, who served on thespecial Iran-Contra investigating committee. ``But there comes aquestion of balance in terms of whether one should or should notreopen the investigation.''   Mitchell said more about Reagan's role in the funneling ofproceeds from arms sales to Iran to the Contras likely will surfaceduring the trials of Poindexter, who succeeded Robert McFarlane asnational security adviser, and Secord, a former Air Force general.   The Maine Democrat had asked the Senate panel to examine whycongressional investigators never saw the six previously undisclosedWhite House memos when copies surfaced during the trial of formernational security aide Oliver North.   The intelligence panel reported Friday that the White Housesometimes handled documents in a chaotic and haphazard manner whenCongress sought them for its Iran-Contra hearings two years ago. Butthe committee said there was no evidence of a calculated cover-up bythe Reagan administration.   Among those documents was a Feb. 19, 1985, memo to formerPresident Reagan from then-National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane.   The memo recommended that Reagan write Honduran President RobertoSuazo to reaffirm U.S. support for Contra rebels in Nicaragua andpledge U.S. help in defending Honduras if Nicaraguan troops crossedits border.   Located in an informal ``heads of state'' file in a box of papersat Reagan's presidential library in California, the documentsuggested a ``quid pro quo'' arrangement with Honduras that has beendenied by President Bush. At the time, Congress had banned directU.S. aid to the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
