(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan went horsebackriding Sunday at his mountaintop ranch, relaxing after a weekendsummit in Mexico with President Miguel de la Madrid.   After breakfast with his wife Nancy, Reagan saddled up for aride along the trails of his 688-acre spread in the Santa Ynezmountains. Skies were clear and temperatures were warm, in the 70s.   The Reagans, who left Washington on Friday, will remain at theranch until Wednesday when they return to the White House on theeve of the unveiling of the budget proposal being sent to Congressfor the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   As Reagan relaxed, White House chief of staff Howard Baker flewback to Washington, leaving deputy chief of staff KennethDuberstein, national security adviser Colin Powell andcommunications director Thomas Griscom as the senior officials withReagan.   Powell and Griscom are to return to Washington on Tuesday, a dayahead of the president. The staff members stay at a Santa Barbarahotel, about 25 miles from Reagan's ranch.   Reagan arrived here Saturday evening after spending about fourhours at a summit with de la Madrid at the Pacific coast resort ofMazatlan.   The annual meeting _ the sixth and final summit of the twooutgoing presidents _ was marked by de la Madrid's bluntly wordeddefense of Mexico's campaign to curb the production and traffickingof illegal drugs.   De la Madrid said Mexico's efforts were not appreciated, andthat the United States must do more to curb the demand for drugs,which is at the source of the problem.   Reagan replied, ``The people in the United States are nowturning away from drugs,'' a step he said should ``curb the demandthat fuels the trafficking.''   As Reagan flew to his ranch Saturday evening, senioradministration officials who accompanied him departed on their own,flying back to Washington or other sites. Secretary of State GeorgeP. Shultz, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Treasury SecretaryJames A. Baker III and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter hadjoined Reagan at the meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
