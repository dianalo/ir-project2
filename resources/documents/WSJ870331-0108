The ministry's package for the year starting April 1 covers imports and intermediary trade. The program, one of about 20 bills approved by parliament last Friday, also expands coverage on manufacturers' overseas investment to commercial, as well as political, risks, and enables Japan to participate in international insurance packages.    &quot;The plans are based on the idea of Japan's helping to reduce the debt crisis in developing countries by increasing purchases from them and capital flow to them,&quot; said Naoyuki Haraoka, deputy director of MITI's export-insurance division.    The program is meant mainly to boost sales from developing countries to Japan and other industrialized nations. If fully subscribed and used as intended, the plan could bring as much as $9 billion of new capital to developing countries starting April 1, Mr. Haraoka said.    Japanese trading companies and embassy officials of exporting countries familiar with the program are generally optimistic about it. But they have no projections for the aid or export sales it might generate because Tokyo has yet to provide details on how it would work. MITI hopes to settle specifics, such as fees and risk assessment, through discussion with Japanese companies during the next six months. The new system is scheduled to take effect in October.    The details likely will be similar to those in Japan's current export-insurance program, such as an average insurance fee of 0.4% to 0.5% of total value of the contract, Mr. Haraoka said.    The import-insurance program allots $3.1 billion in the coming financial year to cover pre-paid contracts for as much as 97.5% of their value. MITI records show that about 10% of all import contracts include an advance payment of more than one-half of the contract's value.    Trading companies and embassy officials of exporting countries say the 97.5% ceiling on coverage is an attractive aspect of the plan, but they don't foresee a sudden surge in relevant imports.    Other traders say that relations with their usual suppliers in developing countries are such that they don't require prepayment. &quot;The program may be more useful for opening new avenues with smaller general-merchandise firms,&quot; said Masahiro Akechi, a spokesman for Marubeni Corp., a Japanese trading company. </TEXT></DOC>
