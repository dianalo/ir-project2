The exhaust gas heat with an output of 243 kW is used directly (withouta heat exchanger). The exhaust gas is mixed with the furnace air fromthe cooling zone of the furnace and is taken directly to the air systemof the drier. A gas blower burner was also installed to cover the peakload. The electrical output of 350 kW is used in parallel with the mainssupply to supply the whole brick works. If there is a mains failure,the cogeneration plant takes the electricity supply over in island operation.</TEXT></DOC>
