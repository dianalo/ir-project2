(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The failures of the U.S. space programover the past 30 years are highlighted in an unusual exhibit.   The exhibit at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center featuresthe remains of the Mercury-Atlas I, the ill-fated, unmanned rocketthat exploded less than one minute after liftoff on July 29, 1960.   The remains were retrieved from the floor of the Atlantic Oceanmore than 20 years ago and previously were housed in a museum inOrlando, Fla.   The exhibit, which opened Monday, also includes a backup unit forProject Vanguard, the U.S. response to the Soviet Sputnik. Vanguard,launched Dec. 6, 1957, rose six inches and collapsed.   But the display is not only about failures. ``This shows thedifficulties we faced in getting man, and rockets, into space,''said Max Ary, executive director of the space museum.   There is a wall-sized mural of President John F. Kennedy. An oldRCA television sitting in a recreation of a 30-year-old livingroomplays Kennedy's speech to Congress in which he proposed the Apollomoon-landing program.   ``I believe that this nation should commit itself to achievingthe goal before the decade is out of landing a man on the moon andreturning him safely to Earth,'' Kennedy said.   A brief video called ``39 Percent Success Rate'' provides a lightlook at some of the 80 U.S. unmanned satellite launches, 49 of whichended in failure.   A block house blast window _ a 250-pound chunk of glass thatshielded the launch crew at Cape Canaveral _ sits in the middle ofthe exhibit.</TEXT></DOC>
