Though the Nikkei's advance Thursday had been expected tobe twice as big, the move was still viewed as a reasonableone, given the steady selling pressure linked to margin callsand investment trust redemptions.   And though the Nikkei didn't regain its closing level oflast Friday, which was 22814.37, participants said marketconditions had essentially returned to the condition theywere in before the Soviet coup attempt caused stocks toplummet.   In London, shares climbed on market enthusiasm aboutprospects for accelerated reform in the Soviet Union. TheFinancial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 21.1points to 2623.0, breaking the previous record of 2621.0posted last Friday, the last trading day before the Sovietcoup. The FT 30-stock index jumped 22.4 points, or 1.1%, to2033.7. Volume was 539.3 million shares, compared with 544.9million shares a day earlier.   Demand in London fizzled at the day's highest levels, inresponse to Wall Street's lackluster opening and signs thatthe rally in Britain was running out of steam after havingpulled the 100-share index up 82.5 points since Monday.Still, the Soviet Union's removal of opponents to economicreform was viewed in London as bullish, easing fears aboutmilitary budgets and trade with Eastern countries. Amongfundamental factors, the market got modest support fromBritish trade data for July that were less bearish than hadbeen expected.   In Frankfurt, stocks closed around their intraday highs.The DAX index soared 60.01 points to 1630.83, which was justoff the intraday high of 1631.18. The market eased atmid-session on profit-taking, but was generally bolstered asSoviet President Mikhail Gorbachev reasserted control afterthis week's failed putsch. Moreover, the German central bankpresident said last week's interest-rate increases weresufficient for now, damping speculation about a furtherboost. The market also was considered to have more climbingroom as it continued to retrace losses from Monday's debacle.   Propelled by news of the failed Soviet coup, stocksrecorded strong gains throughout Asia. Sydney posted a 1%rise but is still below pre-coup levels. Hong Kong sharesskyrocketed 4.7% to their level before the Soviet crisis.Singapore's 4.9% jump defied expected profit-taking. Taipeishares jumped 6.8%, despite caution in buying byinstitutions. Manila prices soared 3.9%. Wellington stocksbounded up 2.9%. Seoul logged a 3.9% advance. Europeanshares' climb was broad but not as strong as that in Asia. Acalmer atmosphere pervaded big bourses on the Continent,replacing the volatility in the wake of the Soviet coup andits failure. Gains on many European exchanges were modest.Paris logged its third rise in a row.   Among corporate developments, in Tokyo, Sony rose as muchas 270 yen during the day but finished with an increase of 80yen, or 1.4%, to 5,750 yen ($42.15), its low for the day, onexpectations of a poor earnings report. The big consumerelectronics maker's consolidated pretax profit for its firstquarter ended June 30 dropped 20% to 56.2 billion yen ($412million) from a year earlier, citing stagnating economies inthe U.S. and Europe and sluggishness in the Japaneseaudiovisual equipment market and the yen's strengthening inforeign exchange markets. Sony also revised its earningsprojection for fiscal 1992 ending March 31, sayingconsolidated operating profit should be flat at 300 billionyen, down from its earlier forecast for an 8% increase. Sonycited the yen's appreciation and intensifying pricecompetition.   Honda Motor climbed 50, or 3.7%, to 1,400. The automaker's consolidated pretax earnings for its first quarterended June 30 rose 6.3% to 46.23 billion yen, partly becauseof lower manufacturing costs. But net income dwindled 9.3% to21.35 billion yen, partly as a result of growing incometaxes. Sales rose 2.4% to 1.15 trillion yen, mainly becauseof strong motorcycle sales.   In Frankfurt, Veba jumped 12.50 marks, or 3.7%, to 353.50marks ($203.40). As the slump in Germany's chemical industrycontinued, the big petrochemical, utility and trading groupsaid first-half net income rose 1.8% to 398 million marks($229 million), despite a 14% increase in sales to 29.75billion marks. The results matched analysts' expectations.Strength in its secondary sectors wasn't enough to overcomeweakness in chemicals, said Veba, Germany's fourth-largestindustrial company.   In Amsterdam, DAF closed at 22.7 guilders ($11.57),unchanged. The truck maker, crippled by its heavy reliance onthe slumping British market, posted a first-half loss of179.1 million guilders ($91.3 million), widening from ayear-earlier deficit of 32.1 million guilders. Though theresults were worse than most expectations, the market washeartened by DAF's forecast for a better second half, thoughsome analysts were skeptical. DAF also announced plans tosell preference shares, to raise at least 200 millionguilders.   In Stockholm, LM Ericsson Class B shares added 2 Swedishkronor, or 1.1%, to 177 kronor ($28.04). Thetelecommunications giant reported that second-quarter pretaxprofit plunged 37% to 766 million kronor ($121.3 million), atthe low end of expectations. The weak results were attributedmainly to increased research and development costs, despite asharp decline in Ericsson's orders because of recessions inseveral key markets. The Stockholm bourse was relieved byEricsson's upbeat mood about its aggressive productdevelopment.   In Hong Kong, Hang Seng Bank advanced 1.25 Hong Kongdollars, or 3.9%, to HK$33.25 (US$4.28). The bank, thecolony's No. 2 financial institution behind its parent,Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking, said first-half profit climbed22% to HK$794 million ($102.2 million), exceeding mostanalysts' expectations, and it proposed a 20% increase in itsinterim dividend to 27 cents a share.
