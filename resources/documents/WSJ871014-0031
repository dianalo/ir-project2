The food-industry giant of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said net income edged up to $59.3 million, or 72 cents a share, from $59 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier when there were more shares outstanding. Sales rose 15% to $1.33 billion, from $1.16 billion, triggered by volume gains in CPC's consumer foods business.    The flat earnings reflected &quot;a significant increase in financing costs&quot; stemming from acquisitions and a stock buy-back, said James R. Eiszner, chairman and president. Financing costs more than doubled to $27.7 million, from $12.1 million a year earlier.    Pretax operating profit rose 13% to $132 million, from $117 million in the year-earlier period.    Although the company declined to estimate total earnings for the year, it said it expects per-share profit to rise about 20% to about $2.76, excluding a second-quarter special pretax operating gain of $176 million. Last year, the company earned $2.30 a share. The improvement partly reflects restructuring moves that involved, among other things, the sale of a 50% stake in CPC's subsidiaries in six Asian countries to Ajinomoto Co. of Japan.    Based on this year's nine-month average of about 82 million shares outstanding, a 20% increase in per-share earnings would indicate 1987 net income of $226.3 million, or about a 3% increase from $219.2 million for all of 1986. The company noted, however, that it continues to buy back shares and that the calculation is subject to change. Since last November, CPC has purchased about 16 million of the 20 million shares it expects to repurchase.    For the first nine months, CPC said net surged 91%, to $277.8 million, or $3.38 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier. But excluding the second-quarter gain, which partly reflected restructuring activities, net inched up 4%, to $151.8 million, or $1.85 a share.    Excluding the gain, operating profit for the nine-month period rose 18%, to $344.1 million, from $291.8 million. Operating profit for the quarter and nine-month period included a $10.2 million fourth-quarter operating loss from its European corn-milling operations, which the company sold last month. CPC has said it expects grocery products to account for about 80% of its 1988 revenue, compared with more than 60% currently, as a result of the sale. </TEXT></DOC>
