Supporters include President Bush's new Education PolicyAdvisory Committee, a diverse group of educators andbusinessmen that has endorsed national testing in the fourth,eighth and 12th grades.</LP><TEXT>   Advocates say children won't study harder until thefederal government -- or somebody with federal blessing --tells their parents how they rank on a reliable test thateveryone takes. As a further motivation for students, manyproponents say, scores on the test must matter in decidingsuch things as high school graduation or the kind of job astudent can get. Schools, districts and states also could beranked using national test data.   National tests drive the efforts of students in countriessuch as Britain, Japan and West Germany, but would representa radical break with U.S. traditions of local control. Theyalso raise the possibility of a person's educational futureand career options being decided at an early age. In an Aug.8 background paper, the U.S. Education Department's staffcalled the concept a &quot;dramatic shift from the last twocenturies of practice in education in the U.S.&quot; that wouldrepresent a &quot;de facto national agreement on what should betaught.&quot;   Among the ideas favored by some on the president'sadvisory group is a national high school graduation test. Avariation on that theme was recommended in June by theCommission on the Skills of the American Workforce, afoundation-funded group of education and labor leaders. Thecommission proposed that all 16 year olds take a test to gaina certificate that employers could require as a jobcredential.   &quot;My own view is that we ought to have a strict nationaltest that students have to study for, much as Europeans andAsians do,&quot; says Thomas E. Kean, a former governor of NewJersey and a member of both the advisory and work forcegroups. &quot;A lot of us are terribly frustrated with the currentsystem and feel we need to do something radical to changeit.&quot;   Paul O'Neill, chief executive officer of Aluminum Co. ofAmerica and chairman of the presidential advisory group, sayshe favors a national test because current indicators,including report cards and scores on existing standardizedtests, give parents an overly rosy impression of students'achievement. Says Mr. O'Neill, &quot;The education world is fullof jargon and soft ideas, and we need to harden up.&quot;   Mr. O'Neill and other members of the advisory group arguethat national tests are the only way to fulfill the &quot;nationaleducation goals&quot; set by the president and governors in amuch-ballyhooed exercise last March. The chief goal is thatstudents will show &quot;demonstrated competency in challengingsubject matter&quot; by the year 2000 in English, history,geography, mathematics and science.   Other support has come from Albert Shanker, president ofthe American Federation of Teachers union and a member ofboth groups. In a memo to the presidential panel earlier thismonth, Mr. Shanker proposed &quot;an initial national investmentof between $200 million and $300 million to develop nationalexaminations.&quot;   Many testing critics disagree with these supporters of themovement. They counter that the country is alreadyover-testing students. Walt Haney, a Boston College professorand testing specialist, says his reaction is &quot;largelyunfavorable&quot; to the idea of mass tests. Mr. Haney says, &quot;Whentests on individual students are used to measure the schools,the results can be easily corrupted&quot; by teachers who promptstudents on test questions and give them more time to finishitems.   It isn't yet clear what will emerge from currentproposals. Mr. O'Neill says the panel is still preparingspecific recommendations about which students would betested, which subjects would be treated and who would pay forit. The Education Department, prompted by the group, also hasbegun studying possibilities. Among other things, U.S.researchers are looking at ways to report a standard nationaltest score that would give parents a new measure of theirchildren's school progress.   At the same time, behind-the-scenes debate on monitoringnational education goals has exposed a potentiallyembarrassing problem for the Bush administration.   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is opposed to federalsponsorship of a national test to monitor the goals, arguingin a private Aug. 8 letter to Mr. O'Neill that &quot;it wouldalter two centuries of tradition&quot; of states' educationcontrol.   Others in the administration have been taken aback thatthe O'Neill panel, laden with conservative businessmen andRepublicans, has proposed something Mr. Kean calls &quot;not avery conservative idea.&quot; At a July meeting of the O'Neillgroup, according to people who were there, White Housedomestic-policy adviser Roger Porter exchanged angry wordswith David Kearns, chairman of Xerox Corp., when Mr. Kearnssuggested the Bush administration was dragging its feet onfollowing through with effective monitoring of the goals.   The Education Department's background paper, whileendorsing no particular option, suggests that the Bushadministration would accept some form of national testing, solong as the federal government's role was limited. The papersaid alternatives to complete federal sponsorhip include aschools' consortium similar to the ones that run collegeentrance tests or a specially chartered group partly fundedby the states and federal government.   Under its most ambitious configuration, the paper said anational testing program would have a huge impact on schools,and take several years to implement. More than nine millionstudents in three grades -- roughly six times the number thattake the Scholastic Aptitude Test -- would be tested eachyear. The paper warns, however, that curriculum variety couldnarrow rapidly, as students and teachers focus on subjectscovered by the exam.   Under the only current federal examination program, theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, about 220,000students will be tested this year. But NAEP merely measureswhether the nation's students as a whole are making progressover the years and isn't used to measure individual students.In its background paper, the Education Department says itmight be possible to expand NAEP into a national examination,or to calculate a standard report to parents that wouldequate state-mandated tests that students are already takingwith NAEP scores.   Chester E. Finn Jr., chairman of the panel that runs NAEPand also a member of the presidential panel, says he hasn'tdecided whether a new test is needed. But he adds that he'sconvinced parents need new information because most of themfalsely believe their children are doing well. &quot;Right now youcan't find out how your kid or school stands vis-a-visnational goals, and if you can't find that out, you won'tchange your behavior toward your kid, and nothing is going tochange.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
