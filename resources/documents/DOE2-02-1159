General views are presented first concerning economic circumstances,safety concerns, environmental impacts and technology transfer. Fromthese considerations, it is insisted that the characteristics of futureSMPR must include simplicity of system, inherent safety and modular design.Considerations are also made of the current and future energy consumptionand supply in Taiwan. It is concluded that there will be a very strongdemand for nuclear power in Taiwan in the years to come. The favorablefactors of SMPR that attract developing countries include: (1) the easeof matching the uncertain load growth, (2) less economic risk in investment,(3) shorter construction leadtimes, (4) less environmental impacts, (5)simpler system with reduced potential hazard and less maintenance effort,(6) less impact to the existing grid system, (7) easier technology transfer,(8) easier establishment of fabrication capability for small and standardizedcomponents, (9) more local participation and (10) simpler licensing procedure.But the difficulty in new site exploration to meet the need of growingnumber of units may represent a problem to be resolved especially fordensely populated countries.
