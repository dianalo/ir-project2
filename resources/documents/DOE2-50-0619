<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0619 </DOCNO><TEXT>The upper Mozambique Fan includes a stable down-stream region, with anorth-south channel flanked by thick (1.5 sec two-way traveltime) asymmetriclevees, and a migrating upstream region where at least two main feedingpaths have been successively dominant. From the Oligocene to early Miocene,the north-south Serpa Pinto Valley acted as the main conduit for thenorth Mozambique terrigenous sediments. From the middle Miocene, thewest-east Zambezi Valley became the dominant path and supplied the fanwith sediments transported by the Zambezi River from the central partof Mozanbique. The transfer from one sediment-feeding system to the otheris related to the abandonment of the Serpa Pinto Valley because of grabenformation along the Davie Ridge, which trapped the sediments, and theincrease of the Zambezi River sediment supply because of the creationand erosion of the East African Rift. 13 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
