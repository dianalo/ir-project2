Net income for the first three months was $668 million, or62 cents a share, from $594 million, or 55 cents a share, ayear earlier. Revenue rose to $8.89 billion from $8.66billion in the 1989 quarter.</LP><TEXT>   While earnings were slightly below analysts' expectationsof 68 cents to 70 cents a share, ATandamp;T posted a strong 21%increase in operating profit in the quarter, to $1.18 billionfrom $977 million the previous year, indicating that itsstruggle to control costs is paying off.   Net income was hurt by several factors including increasedinterest expenses, a higher tax rate and costs associatedwith last January's network disaster, when a software problemshut down the company's nationwide long-distance network fornine hours. In addition, ATandamp;T's telecommunications-equipmentbusiness continues to suffer from increased price competitionand a softening of orders for switching equipment from localtelephone companies.   Despite these problems, ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen saidthe New York-based company's results showed it was off to &quot;astrong start toward making 1990 an even stronger year than1989, which was our best.&quot;   Mr. Allen, who made his comments at the company's annualmeeting at the convention center here, added that ATandamp;T hasset a goal for itself of increasing its earnings by at least10% to 12% annually. &quot;We were clearly ahead of that in thefirst quarter. Typically, the first quarter is a weak one forus.&quot; (Profit in the first quarter actually rose slightly morethan 12%.)   However, ATandamp;T received a boost from businesses that hadnot been a part of the company a year earlier, includingIstel Group Ltd., a U.K. information services companyacquired in the fourth quarter of 1989, and two divisions ofPacifiCorp Financial Services, which were purchased by ATandamp;TCapital Corp. during the first quarter.   ATandamp;T's revenue from product sales, including telephone andcomputer equipment, increased a meager 1.2% to $2.72 billionfrom $2.69 billion the year before. Mr. Allen blamed thelackluster sales on the &quot;rather weak economy&quot; and a backlogin computer-systems sales &quot;due to customer demand and ourinability to fill that demand.&quot; To improve shipments, ATandamp;Trecently began manufacturing personal computers to augmentsupplies from Intel Corp.   Mr. Allen said the company is banking on new products toboost sales. These include its recently announced creditcard, in which orders so far &quot;have exceeded our wildestexpectations . . . customers are calling us by the tens ofthousands.&quot; In addition, he announced that ATandamp;T will beginselling switching equipment based on an optical computerprocessor developed by Bell Laboratories, within five years.   Analysts reacted favorably to the company's results. &quot;Theearnings masked what was probably ATandamp;T's best quarter sincedivestiture,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebberInc. Long-distance &quot;volume is up 7% and operating marginswere 13.2%, two points higher than a year ago. That's a lotof expansion for a company this size.&quot; He estimated that thenetwork outage alone cost ATandamp;T about three cents a sharebecause of lost revenue and remittances to business customerscovered under ATandamp;T's 800 Assurance Plan.   Robert B. Morris III, telecommunications analyst atGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said ATandamp;T earnings were about threecents less than his estimate. And sales, general andadministrative expenses were 35.2% of revenue &quot;when I hadexpected 34%.&quot; But Mr. Morris said, &quot;I wouldn't characterizethis as a disappointing quarter.&quot;   At the shareholder meeting, Mr. Allen defended thecompany's previously reported decision to withdraw itsfunding of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ATandamp;Tannounced the move on March 26 following pressure applied onthe company by shareholding anti-abortion activists.   Referring to protests by Planned Parenthood, Mr. Allensaid: &quot;I'm disappointed in their actions. If someone weresupporting me for 25 years, I would say `thank you.' In thelast 25 years, we funded them to the tune of $600,000, and wenever heard a word of thanks from them.&quot;   Mr. Allen added that ATandamp;T will spend $2.5 million thisyear supporting teen-pregnancy prevention programs similar tothose they had been supporting at Planned Parenthood.   Mr. Allen said Planned Parenthood has elevated theabortion issue to political advocacy and that &quot;this causedour opponents and proponents to say that we are supportingabortion. I concluded -- I should say the {ATandamp;T} foundationconcluded -- that abortion or opposing abortion shouldn't besupported by the corporation.&quot;   A first-time shareholder proposal that ATandamp;T stop fundingorganizations that advocate abortion managed to win 5.5% ofthe votes cast at the company's annual meeting, insuring itsinclusion on the ballot for a second time at ATandamp;T's 1991meeting. Another resolution, calling on ATandamp;T to drop itsaffirmative action program, garnered 8.8% of the vote, lessthan the 10% it needed to be included for the fourth timenext year.   ATandamp;T common stock fell $1 yesterday to close at $41 ashare in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</TEXT></DOC>
