Edwin W. Edwards plunge toward Saturday's runoff election.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CHRISTIANITY AN ISSUE IN RACEDUKE'S CONVERSION CALLED FRAUD IN BID FOR BIBLEVOTE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See related article this page  </MEMO><TEXT>     Duke, a Republican state legislator, seems to have gotten the worst of theexchange, which features allegations of blasphemy against Edwards and claimsthat Duke's religious conversion is a fraud.;   Tuesday, Duke's candidacy wasdealt a serious blow as news spread that a top aide had quit the campaignbecause of his strong doubts about &quot;David's relationship with Jesus.&quot;;   Duke,a former Ku Klux Klan leader and American Nazi, has begun quoting Scripture ashe campaigns for the state's highest office as a born-again Christian. Thetheme of religious redemption, while a new one for Duke, is closely related tohis claim that he has changed and no longer holds extreme racist andanti-Semitic views.;   But Bob Hawks, a campaign aide who Duke publiclythanked from the podium at his election-night celebration Oct. 19, believesDuke is lying about his religious conversion.;   &quot;The straw that broke thecamel's back,&quot; Hawks said, came during an interview Duke gave to a Christiantelevision station in West Monroe, La.;   &quot;Duke was asked what church hebelonged to, and after hesitating for at least a 20-second delay, he namedsome Church of Christ, which later proved to be untrue,&quot; Hawks told a NewOrleans television station.;   &quot;When Duke had to lie about his churchaffiliation, he certainly would lie about his relationship with Christ oranything else,&quot; concluded Hawks, a former Tennessee state legislator who hadbeen the Duke campaign's statewide coordinator.;   Duke denies the allegationand claims Hawks was planted in his organization by Democrat Edwards.;   Thephony conversion charge threatens to undermine support for Duke fromfundamentalist Christians, a crucial segment of his coalition of alienatedwhite voters.;   The controversy could drive away as much as 2 percent or 3percent of Duke's support, analysts said, at a time when he seems to befinding it increasingly difficult to reach 50 percent.;   Duke's supportershave distributed glossy leaflets depicting Duke's opponent as a blasphemer.;  Duke has criticized Edwards' views on the crucifixion, in an attempt toundermine his political support from voters in heavily Catholic southernLouisiana, a traditional Edwards stronghold.;   Edwards dismissed the attacksas a rehash of old charges.;   &quot;Duke should not be concerned about myrelationship with my Jesus and my Christ, because the one that I know and loveand respect is totally alien to the philosophy that Duke has. So he must beworshiping a different Christ,&quot; Edwards said.;   Edwards, who is divorced,described himself as &quot;a practicing member of the Catholic Church.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Baltimore Sun  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Livingston, La.  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  487  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 13, 199100318078,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
