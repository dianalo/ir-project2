It is shown that implantation of As leadsto a greatly increased rate of oxidation in a dry O{sub 2} ambient. Oxidationof a silicide implanted with inert Ar{sup +} ions showed that the effectis not solely due to ion-induced damage but depends on the presence ofAs in the film. The microstructure of these films, before and after oxidation,was studied using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy andRutherford backscattering. Also, the morphology of As{sup +}-implantedfilms after rapid thermal annealing will be discussed. Under certainconditions, the morphology is substantially affected by the implant.</TEXT></DOC>
