BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines and the Transport Workers Unionreached agreement in principle Tuesday on a contract for thecarrier's 23,000 ground service workers after 2{ weeks of mediation.   Details of the contract were not released pending agreement onfinal language and a vote by the membership.   A company news release said the agreement was reached after 27hours of continuous bargaining.   The release said American Vice President Charles Pasciuto andTWU International Vice President John Kerrigan ``said the agreementbenefits both the company and the union and will enable American tocontinue the growth plan that has made the airline an industryleader.''   The mediation was requested after union members turned downAmerican's $610 million offer.   The offer included raises of as much as 99 percent for someworkers, but union leaders objected to a two-tier wage scale underwhich it takes new hires as long as 12 years to reach top pay. Theunion had sought to reduce that to about five years.   The union also objected to provisions under which employeeswould contribute to the company health plan for the first time.   Airline officials complained that the contract was a victim ofunion politics because several locals were in the midst of electioncampaigns and candidates used the contract as an issue.   The four-year pact became amendable on March 1.   Under federal law, airline contracts do not expire. If the twosides cannot reach agreement, a mediator is called in to sparknegotiations; if the mediator declares an impasse in the talks,there is then a 30-day cooling off period. A strike can be calledonly after that period expires.   The TWU represents about 23,000 of American's 67,000 employees.Its members include the airline's mechanics, bag handlers, groundcrews, stock clerks, guards, meteorologists and aircraft cleaners.   Also Tuesday, American's parent company, AMR Corp., confirmed itis on the verge of ordering about 100 new commuter aircraft in a``several hundred million dollar'' deal.   The aircraft, seating 30-40 people, would be used for thecompany's AMR Eagle Inc. subsidiary that feeds some of its majorhubs.   Published reports have said the company is leaning towardSwedish manufacture Saab, although others mentioned as possiblesuppliers include Boeing Canada-DeHavilland Division, based nearToronto, and ATR, a French-Italian company.   Fort Worth-based AMR is coming off its most profitable yearever, during which it became the nation's largest carrier. AMRposted a 1988 profit of $476.8 million, a 140.3 percent increasefrom 1987 and 37.9 percent higher than the previous record of$345.8 million in 1985.   The company also reported a first-quarter profit of $101million, a 47.7 percent jump from 1988's first three months.Operating revenues were $2.45 billion.   The purchase would be the fourth by American this year. InMarch, American announced a $3.09 billion deal with Dutchmanufacturer Fokker for 75 F-100 planes and options for another 75;and an approximately $2 billion purchase of 25 Boeing 757s and 10Boeing 767s.   On Feb. 7, American announced another $7 billion deal to buyeight McDonnell Douglas Corp. jets with options for another 142.</TEXT></DOC>
