After bottoming out at 9.37% in mid-February, rates on30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 9.6% last week,according to HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., firm that tracksmortgage rates. &quot;I feel strongly that we're at the bottom or,in fact, past it,&quot; says Barry Havemann, HSH president.   David Berson, chief economist at the Federal NationalMortgage Association, agrees: &quot;I think it will be difficultto get much below where we were a few weeks ago.&quot;   Consumers are reacting as if they fear missing the bottom.Mortgage originations in February rose 44% from December,according to a recent survey by the Mortgage BankersAssociation. About 40% of the loans represent refinancings,as borrowers move to lock in at low rates (see related story&quot;Your Money Matters:&quot; -- WSJ March 21, 1991)   But many analysts say rates won't shoot back up quickly.&quot;The window of opportunity may well have closed a little, butI think it will remain open for a while longer,&quot; Mr. Bersonsays.   Treasury bond rates, which mortgages parallel, shouldrange from 8% to 8 1/2%, says Lyle Gramley, chief economistfor the Mortgage Bankers Association. That would keepfixed-rate mortgages below 10 1/4%, he says.   Adjustable-rate mortgages, however, continued to ease lastweek, reaching a low for the year of 7.4%. Lenders are tryingto lure borrowers to ARMs, which carry less risk to the bank.                                                                                                          Federal Government   Saves on Leases                                                                                                          THE COMMERCIAL real-estate slump is costing tax payersbillions through the federal thrift bailout, but it's alsomaking for some bargains on federal leases in the overbuiltWashington, D.C., office market.   &quot;A large inventory&quot; of leases signed by the federalgovernment in the 1960s and 1970s are expiring, says RobertGoodman of the Washington regional office of the GeneralServices Administration, which negotiates leases for thefederal government. &quot;That puts us out into the marketplace ata very auspicious time.&quot;   Office vacancy rates in Washington are about 12%, and insuburban Maryland and northern Virginia they exceed 18%,according to Cushman andamp; Wakefield, a real-estate firm.   The federal government leases 34.7 million of the 190million square feet of office space in the metropolitan areaand owns an additional 33.3 million square feet, Mr. Goodmansays, with leases on 19.7 million square feet of spaceexpiring between last September and September 1994. That addsup to a lot of leverage. And the government has begun towield it much better than in the past, say commercial brokersin the area.   When government leases come due, the GSA runs newspaperadvertisements soliciting bids for space, then bargains withdevelopers. &quot;They'll scour the market to make darn sure therearen't other options that are cheaper&quot; than renewal, saysJohn Lienhard of the Washington office of Coldwell BankerCommercial.   The GSA's Mr. Goodman says that because the governmentleases such large spaces, developers are willing to offerdeeper discounts. In addition, he says, the government'scredit-worthiness gives developers &quot;a triple-A rating theycan take to the bank.&quot; The result, he says, is often dealspriced below market.   The slumping market also seems to have gained thegovernment more respect. &quot;Developers used to look to the GSAas tenant of last resort,&quot; says Ray Ritchey, a senior vicepresident in the Washington office of Boston Properties, adevelopment company. &quot;Now they're looking at them as one ofthe best.&quot;                                                                                                          Big Investors Make   Room for Apartments                                                                                                          AFTER SEVERAL years of deteriorating investmentperformance, apartment buildings appear poised for acomeback.   Many of the nation's biggest owners of multifamily housingadded to their portfolios last year, according to theNational Multi Housing Council, a trade group for therental-housing industry.   NHP Inc. in Washington, D.C., the nation's largest ownerof multifamily housing, increased the number of units inwhich it has an ownership interest to 90,316 as of Jan. 1from 81,418 a year earlier.   Over the past year, Lincoln Property in Dallas, thenation's fourth-largest owner, bought 1,100 units in Phoenix,Ariz., and 800 in Denver, increasing its portfolio to 65,807units from 63,206.   &quot;We think the market in most areas has bottomed out,&quot; saysPreston Butcher, president and chief executive of Lincoln'sWest Coast operation. &quot;Our portfolio ought to increasesubstantially over the next three years.&quot;   Ivan Faggen, director of Arthur Andersen Real EstateServices Group, says the multifamily market &quot;is the productline with the strongest potential for the next decade.&quot;   Though the national vacancy rate for buildings with fiveor more units is 9%, Mr. Faggen says he expects it to fall to6% within a few years. He says demand is sufficient to absorbsome 400,000 new units a year, but only about 250,000 units ayear are being built. The result, he predicts, will be risingrents and values.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          IN THE LAST quarter of 1990, a 2,200-square-foot home inCorpus Christi, Texas, would have fetched $82,338, the lowestprice of 219 cities surveyed by Coldwell Banker ResidentialGroup. A similar house would have sold for $1.5 million inBeverly Hills, Calif., the country's most expensive market. .. . Hotel deals slumber: The number of hotel rooms sold lastyear plunged 65% from 1989 to 24,000, reflecting the hotelindustry's poor health.</TEXT></DOC>
