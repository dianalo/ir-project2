Holdings Inc., a Denver-basedhome-builder with ties to several failed thrifts, arescheduled to plead guilty today to a federal conspiracycharge related to illegal political campaign contributions.   Because the units are pleading guilty, federal prosecutorswon't seek any campaign-related charges against the parentcompany or its other affiliates, said U.S. Attorney MarvinCollins of Dallas, who is overseeing the investigation.</LP><TEXT>   M.D.C. Holdings has been the subject of severalinvestigations since the December 1988 failure of SilveradoBanking, Savings andamp; Loan Association, the Denver thrift thathad President Bush's son, Neil, on its board and that gainednotoriety for its questionable lending practices. M.D.C.Holdings was an investor in and a borrower at Silverado and aborrower at other failed thrifts, including the now-defunctLincoln Savings Association of Irvine, Calif., andDenver-based Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association.   Neither M.D.C. Holdings nor its units have been chargedwith any criminal wrongdoing in connection with the thriftdealings. Most of the investigations, including probes by theU.S. attorney's office, the Denver Election Commission andthe Colorado attorney general's office, have focused onallegations that the company and some of its units solicitedand even pressed for political campaign contributions fromconstruction subcontractors.   Two of the company's units, M.D.C. Construction Co. andRichmond Homes Ltd., are scheduled to plead guilty in federaldistrict court in Denver to a charge that they conspired tosolicit $23,500 in campaign contributions from subcontractorsand then reimburse the subcontractors, concealing the actualsource of the contributions from the Federal ElectionCommission. Three former officers and employees of the unitspreviously pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations.   The M.D.C. Holdings units face maximum possible fines of$500,000 each for the conspiracy charge. The company said it&quot;regrets that the misconduct which is the subject of thisplea agreement occurred.&quot;   The bulk of the contributions covered in the pleaagreement, $12,000, went to Gary Hart's unsuccessfulpresidential campaign in 1988. U.S. Sen. Hank Brown'scampaign received $10,000 of the contributions, and another$1,500 went to a campaign fund of the Democratic NationalCommittee.   &quot;There is no suggestion that any of the candidates ortheir campaigns were aware of the source of thecontributions,&quot; said Mr. Collins, the U.S. attorney inDallas. Mr. Collins took over the Silverado-relatedinvestigations because the U.S. attorney in Denver hadreceived contributions in a previous congressional campaignfrom M.D.C. Holdings Chairman Larry Mizel.</TEXT></DOC>
