Shearson is an equity partner in a group that has made a $1.69 billion, or $60-a-share, hostile tender offer for Koppers. The group, called BNS Inc., is led by British builder Beazer PLC.    Koppers, a construction-material and chemical company, was hoping to have Shearson disclose additional information concerning conflicts of interest that could arise from its role as a suitor, unprecedented for an investment bank.    But Judge Maurice B. Cohill decided to act on the advice of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which told him in a letter, &quot;Shearson's role in the tender offer does not create any conflicts of interest that cannot be remedied.&quot;    The letter added: &quot;The tender offer should not be further delayed by the taking of additional discovery relating to the conflicts question.&quot;    Yet a stumbling block remains in the Pittsburgh case. Judge Cohill -- who has issued a preliminary injunction halting the bid -- still must grapple with whether Shearson's disclosure that it might have violated certain bank-borrowing regulations, known as margin rules, is adequate. He has scheduled an attorneys status conference for Friday, after which he will decide if additional hearings are needed on that issue.    BNS asserts that because the case before the judge relates purely to disclosure, an admission of possible violations is satisfactory under the law; the group argues that it's up to regulatory agencies, not the judiciary, to determine if the violations have taken place.    Some people close to the case, however, suggest that the court might expand on the meaning of disclosure, trying to determine for itself if violations have occurred and the impact they might have on investors.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Koppers closed Friday at $54.125, unchanged.    In a related development, Shearson has acknowledged in a filing with the Pennsylvania Securities Commission that &quot;call reports&quot; had been sent to a Shearson mergers-and-acquisitions executive from a Shearson investment banker who was trying to solicit business from Koppers.    A spokesman for the firm emphasized that the reports contained no information that affected the tender offer. He added that the passage of reports from an investment banker to a mergers and acquisitions official wasn't a violation of Shearson's &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; policy, which tries to isolate stock-trading activities from investment banking. Shearson declined to provide a copy of the policy, however.    &quot;Call reports, as a practical matter, contain no market-sensitive information,&quot; the spokesman said and, therefore, will continue to be sent from investment bankers to mergers and acquisitions officials. </TEXT></DOC>
