Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the Judiciarysubcommittee on criminal justice, said in an interview that hesupported stiffer fines, but added, ``We have to discuss how much toraise them.''   Bush is proposing an increase from $1,000 to $25,000 a day formost violations of banking regulations but up to $1 million daily ifthe violation was made with reckless disregard for the safety of theinstitution.   Edward L. Yingling, executive director of government relationsfor the American Bankers Association, in testimony to Schumer'spanel, said such ``extraordinarily harsh penalties'' could preventbanks and Sandamp;Ls from attracting qualified managers and directors.   ``Increasing civil money penalties to such a substantial amountsets a dangerous precedent giving regulators the power to assesspenalties that could threaten the stability of an institution,'' hesaid.   Yingling also objected to provisions of the Bush proposalpermitting regulators to decide when a violation was committed withreckless disregard, triggering the $1 million penalty. He said finesshould be capped at $2,500 a day.   Schumer, during a break in the hearing, said, ``I think that'stoo low, but I think you could find a happy medium.''   After the House Banking Committee acts on legislation next month,other panels, including Schumer's, likely will amend sections comingwithin their jurisdiction.   Officials of the General Accounting Office, a congressionalinvestigative agency, told the subcommittee earlier that most of themoney lost by failed thrifts is attributable to fraud rather thanadverse economic conditions or deregulation. They said the GAOexamined 26 insolvent savings and loans in eight states and foundevidence of fraud or abusive insider dealing in each.   As part of a broader bill to bail out the insurance fund backingSandamp;L deposits, Bush is proposing spending $50 million a year ondiscovering and prosecuting fraud at banks and Sandamp;Ls.   Schumer suggested that more spending might enable the JusticeDepartment to prosecute a greater proportion of the 4,000 pendingfraud cases involving losses of $100,000 or more.   But the acting associate attorney general, Joe Whitely, declinedto ask for an appropriation larger than recommended by the president.   Meanwhile, David Lewis, a New York attorney representing theNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the Bush billrepresents ``a permanent threat to the rights of the people of thisnation'' and a ``blatant attempt to avoid the Constitution inexchange for a quick economic score for the government coffers.''   He specifically criticized provisions that would give financialinstitution investigators greater access to grand jury testimony,which is normally considered secret, and that would extend thestatute of limitations for bank fraud from five years to 10 years.   The ABA's Yingling complained that a proposal to pay rewards ofup to $100,000 for information leading to bank fraud convictionscould ``lead to widespread abuse by disgruntled employees ordisappointed customers.'' He predicted that overworked authorities``would be inundated with tidbits or hunches.''</TEXT></DOC>
