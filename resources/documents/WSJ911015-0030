Despite thin holiday trading in the U.S. futures market,heating oil for November delivery surged 1.54 cents a gallonto settle at 69.08 cents. That helped push the price ofNovember crude oil 37 cents a barrel higher to $23.46 on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.</LP><TEXT>   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, futuresprices of gas oil, Europe's version of heating oil, climbedby between $2.50 and $4.50 a metric ton. In the IPE'scrude-oil pit, Brent blend futures prices were up as much as38 cents a barrel.   In other petroleum markets, leading U.S. refiners raisedtheir field posting prices for West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark crude, by 50 cents a barrel. And in Vienna, theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reported thatthe average price of OPEC's reference basket of seven crudesclimbed to $20.30 a barrel last week from $19.91 thepreceding week.   Yesterday's higher prices in the futures markets caughtsome oil market participants by surprise. They had expected adownward correction after the strength of recent days.   However, many traders again called it a technical rally,citing breaches of important pricing levels. There was littleevidence of fundamental factors to support the pricing surge-- just the continuing uncertainty over the Soviet Union'soil exports and a nagging worry that this could mean tightsupplies of heating fuels, particularly in Europe, if thewinter is very cold.   Although crude-oil exports by the Soviet Union are downsharply, there has been little direct impact on the flow ofgas oil to Europe so far, according to studies by RobertBoslego, a Winchester, Mass., oil consultant. &quot;The evidencehas yet to show any marked decline in gas oil exports,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Boslego said Europe imports only about 5% of its gasoil supplies from the Soviet Union. His analysis of data fromthe Paris-based International Energy Agency shows thatEurope's net imports of gas oil from the Soviet Unionaveraged 230,000 barrels a day over the past six quarters. Inthis year's second quarter, those imports ran 254,000 barrelsa day.   Still, based on his estimates, at the end of SeptemberEurope's inventories of distillate fuels, including gas oil,were five million barrels lower than a year earlier. &quot;Withthe weather uncertainty, I believe European distillate stocksare too low,&quot; Mr. Boslego said. &quot;If we get colder than normalweather, we could have price spikes.&quot;   So far, the U.S. isn't sending heating oil cargoes toEurope as it did last winter during the Persian Gulf crisis.U.S. inventories of distillate fuels remain comfortably aheadof those of a year ago.   According to figures released yesterday by the U.S. EnergyInformation Administration, however, propane stocks as ofSept. 27 totaled only 51.8 million barrels, the lowestend-of-September level since 1970. &quot;Severe weather early inthe heating season, before normal peak inventory levels arereached, could lead to temporary spot shortages, supplydislocations and/or higher prices for propane,&quot; the agencysaid in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Rumors that China is poised to makeits first purchase of U.S. soybean oil using governmentexport credits supported soybean futures prices in thintrading. The soybean contract for November delivery rose 21/2 cents to settle at $5.48 a bushel. The Bushadministration has granted China export credits good toward60,000 metric tons of soybean oil, which is a byproduct madeby crushing soybeans. A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. For thepast few days, U.S. grain companies have been floating offersto sell the Chinese their allotment of oil, and rumors werecirculating at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday that thecountry is poised to make the purchase, said Daniel W. Basse,market research director for AgResource Co., Chicago. No suchoptimism surrounded talk about the possibility of the Bushadministration granting additional export credits to theSoviet Union, however. Most analysts expect a delay of a weekto 10 days before any new package of credits is announced.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell. Copper for October deliveryended 1.3 cents a pound lower at $1.059; the actively tradedDecember contract fell 1.35 cents to $1.042. Richard Hirsch,vice president of Sharps Pixley in New York, attributed thedecline to selling by funds early in the day and generalweakness in all the base metals. Trading was relatively thin,he pointed out, because of holidays in Canada and the U.S.,although the Commodity Exchange, where copper is traded, wasopen. The fact that copper didn't close below $1.04 wasencouraging, he said, adding he believes prices will holdabove that level.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and platinum prices fell. Gold forOctober delivery ended at $358.90 an ounce, down $1.00; theactively traded December contract finished at $361.30, down$1.10. October and the actively traded January platinum bothlost $4.20 an ounce, ending at $371.70 and $374.20,respectively. December silver lost five cents an ounce tofinish at $4.097. George Milling-Stanley, an analyst atShearson Lehman Brothers, said light profit-taking in a thinmarket caused the prices to decline. James Kneafsey,president of Cambridge Financial Management, a Cambridge,Mass., institutional money management firm, said astronger-than-expected dollar also pushed gold lower. For therest of the week, gold will react to the dollar's movements,he said, but it probably won't fall below $355. Disclosuresthat the Soviet Union doesn't have as much gold as previouslythought will provide a prop to gold prices, he said. Mr.MillingStanley said platinum prices could decline further,perhaps reaching parity with gold. Silver was hit by sellingby Middle Eastern investors yesterday, he said. Lookingahead, he sees silver testing $4 within the week. That wouldpresent a buying opportunity, he said, because improvingindustrial demand will cause prices to rise by 30 to 40 centsbefore the end of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
