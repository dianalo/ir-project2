Boundaries are obtained fortemperatures between 300/sup 0/C and 500/sup 0/C. These are comparedwith two design rules, both of which are shown to be conservative. Additionally,the temperature at which the transition from the characteristic roomtemperature behaviour of continued ratchetting to the 'shakedown' observedat elevated temperatures is investigated. Preliminary results indicatesuch a transition at approximately 150/sup 0/C.</TEXT></DOC>
