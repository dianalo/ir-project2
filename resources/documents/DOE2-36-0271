<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-36-0271 </DOCNO><TEXT>The first principles of fish behaviour in flow fields, and why fish enterwater intakes are considered, together with how they can best be excluded.Possible solutions are discussed where fish exclusion is a priority butthe ability of fish to detect intakes is likely to be poor due to highturbidity. These involve the use of sound, light or hydraulic stimuli.However, results are likely to be site-specific and field trials wouldbe required. The fish-attractant properties of offshore intake structuresare considered. Designers of many existing intake structures have unwittinglyincorporated features which are now recognized as fish attractants, inparticular, open steelwork superstructures and boulder rip-rap. Suchfeatures can be expected to add to the problem of fish ingress.</TEXT></DOC>
