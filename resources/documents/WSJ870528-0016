An Allegis spokesman confirmed that the board will discuss the New York investment firm's announcement that it owns 13% of Allegis's shares and plans to seek control of the board.    &quot;A fight is inevitable,&quot; a company official said.    Meanwhile, Allegis shares soared again in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The price jumped $3 a share to $79.125.    As reported, Coniston said it plans to solicit shareholder consent to remove 13 of Allegis's 16 directors. If successful, it said it would consider breaking up the company's assets, which include United Airlines, Hertz Corp. and its chain of Westin and Hilton International hotels, or selling Allegis whole.    Responses from directors could range from a public statement to a lawsuit to more drastic measures. Earlier this month, the company wove an anti-takeover defense into an aircraft financing pact with Boeing Co., and there have been reports that Allegis may consider similar arrangments with other companies.    Coniston officials, meanwhile, said they had preliminary talks with representatives of the United pilots union, which is seeking to buy the airline. Coniston also contacted the union that represents the carrier's machinists, who are seeking stock ownership as part of a new contract with Allegis. </TEXT></DOC>
