The creation of a workers' state in the eastern part ofGermany has had a fundamental effect on the history of postwarEurope and has influenced the course of world history.   In an historically short period the leadership of the GermanDemocratic Republic brought about a deep social and economicrestructuring. By the 1960s the German Democratic Republic hadfound a firm place among the top 10 industrially developed nationsof the world and its economy continues to grow. And everyone knowsthe successes that have been achieved in everyday life. ...   Of course, the German Democratic Republic, like all countries,has its own problems of development, demanding well thought-outsolutions. They are determined by the internal needs ofmodernization and renewal, which the whole socialist world has nowgotten down to.   All governments are going through a process of integration,restructuring of international politics and the economic order.Nobody can avoid taking part in the global problems and demands ofthe world technological revolution. ... There is no doubt that theSocialist Unity Party has the intellectual potential, richexperience and political authority to cooperate with all forces insociety to answer the questions placed on today's agenda.   The Soviet Union is sincerely interested that East Germanycontinues to grow and develop.   The relationships between socialist countries are characterizedby equality, self-reliance and solidarity. Diversity is no obstacleand is, in contrast, a further important reason for the developmentof cooperation.   We have heard demands for example that the Soviet Union shouldtear down the Berlin Wall because only then could one finallybelieve in our peaceful intentions. Recently in West Germany voiceshave been heard suggesting the reunification of Germany within theborders of 1937. And Silesia in Poland also has been mentioned. OurWestern partners should understand that questions regarding theGerman Democratic Republic are solved not in Moscow but in Berlin.The German Democratic Republic is a sovereign state whichundertakes its own independent actions in defense of its interestsand its domestic and foreign policy.   If one believes recent polls in West Germany, many young peoplebelieve that the Soviet Union was responsible for the division ofGermany after the war. But they must be reminded that the SovietUnion's position was just the opposite. It argued for the unity ofGermany.   We don't idealize the order that has come about in Europe, butthe most important thing is that we now recognize the realities ofpostwar Europe to ensure peace in Europe.   Every time the West has attempted to change the postwar map ofEurope it has led to renewed international tension and an increaseddanger of nuclear war and never contributed to a solution to actualproblems that touched the interests of people.   We look optimistically at the chances for progress in Europeanand world politics. The agreements just reached in Wyoming are goodnews for the world. President Bush in his speech to the UnitedNations talked of his readiness to jointly work toward solving abroad range of international problems and undertakings that faceus. I welcome this announcement and attach great importance to thenew Soviet-American summit meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
