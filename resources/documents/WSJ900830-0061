If the program succeeds, a new half-hour series producedby CBS News could remain on the air to compete with ABCNews's &quot;Nightline.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The show could be anchored by CBS News correspondentCharles Kuralt. Company insiders said that chief White Housecorrespondent Lesley Stahl also might have a role. Theexperiment began last night with a special CBS News broadcastfeaturing an exclusive interview by anchorman Dan Rather withIraqi President Saddam Hussein.   In an interview, Eric Ober, who was named president of CBSInc.'s news division last week, confirmed the plans. Talksabout a half-hour CBS News program that would be aired at11:30 p.m. in most time zones began last week when CBSBroadcast Group President Howard Stringer decided to removeCBS News President David W. Burke and replace him with Mr.Ober, who was president of the CBS-owned television stationsdivision.   &quot;CBS News is looking seriously at time periods forexpansion, and 11:30 p.m. is one under consideration,&quot; Mr.Ober said.   Mr. Ober declined further comment, but other people at CBSNews, who didn't want to be quoted by name, said CBS has nofirm plan for a regular nightly series at 11:30. The divisionis taking a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude, they said.   CBS News's plans come as network news divisions aredevising new ways to boost revenue. For example, ABC News isconsidering an overnight newscast, perhaps to begin onElection Day in November. ABC News said it was exploring thispossibility at the request of its more than 200 affiliates.   CBS's television network long has been frustrated in thefinancially lucrative late-night arena, most recently by itsbig-budget flop, &quot;The Pat Sajak Show.&quot; With itsaction-adventure shows, CBS runs a poor third behind &quot;TheTonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; on General Electric Co.'sNBC network and &quot;Nightline&quot; on Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABCnetwork.   At stake is a share of the $429 million in ad revenueearned by the three major broadcast networks in the 11:30p.m. to 2 a.m. period.   It was another crisis facing U.S. citizens, the hostagesituation in Iran more than 10 years ago, that wasresponsible for the creation of &quot;Nightline.&quot; ABC News'sseries of nightly reports on the 1979-80 Iranian hostagecrisis evolved into the highly respected late-night newsprogram.   The ratings of &quot;Nightline,&quot; which generally finishes No. 2in its time period, soar when a major news event occurs. Forinstance, A.C. Nielsen Co.'s ratings for &quot;Nightline&quot; haveclimbed 27% since the Middle East situation began.   CBS News already produces a two-hour overnight program,&quot;Nightwatch.&quot; When Mr. Burke was removed last week after justtwo years, CBS officials said privately that he wasn't&quot;creative&quot; enough and didn't &quot;energize&quot; the beleaguered newsdivision, which has suffered rounds of layoffs and budgetcutbacks since 1985.   But individuals at CBS said that CBS News's annualoperating budget, estimated at $340 million, will increasenext year.   CBS News had been hoping for millions of dollars in adrevenue from a new series, &quot;Face to Face With Connie Chung,&quot;which the network scheduled for one of its best time periods,Mondays at 10 p.m.   But last month, Ms. Chung unexpectedly canceled her ownseries, and instead would like to air periodic specials,because she wants to try to have a child. That move cost CBSNews millions of dollars, insiders have said.</TEXT></DOC>
