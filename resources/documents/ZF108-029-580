 Meanwhile in the opposing camp, the Open Software Foundation wasflourishing, and made its final choice of technologies for its Motifgraphical user interface, choosing a combin ation of the submissions from DECand Hewlett-Packard.andP;  Visix Software Inc introduced the Looking Glass userinter face manager, set to clash head on with X.desktop from UK rival IXI Ltdof Camb ridge.andP;  DEC confirmed its increasingly serious Unix aspirations bylaunching a new line of non-VAX workstat ions running Ultrix and using theMIPS Computer Systems Inc RISC processor.andP;  And young workstation pretenderSol bourne Computer Inc, a front for Matsushita Electric Ind ustrial Co ofJapan, threw down a challenge to Sun Microsystems with the first Sparc-basedsystems outside of Sun's own.andP;  Another start- up, Network Computing DevicesInc, came out with early examples of a new class of intelligent terminalbased on the X Window System and dub bed X-Stations - many more were tofollow throughout the year.andP;  Prime Computer Inc was still battling against ahos tile takeover bid from MAI Basic Four Inc, while UK Unix house Sphinx Ltdwas reported to have been put up for sale.andM;February:andM;ATandamp;T had to work hard to regain industry confidence in its future plans forUnix after the Open Software Foun dation was formed in 1988, and this month46 of its sup porters formally announced Unix International, to plot thefuture course of Unix in conjunction with the Unix Software Operation.andP;  Bynow, MIPS Computer Systems was on a roll that was to last all year,introducing new syst ems, signing up Siemens and NEC to fabricate its RISCprocessors, and signing up Sony Corp to use its chip in the face ofcompetition from Motorola's 88000 and Sun's Sparc.andP;  After handing Xenix tothe Santa Cruz Operation a couple of years ago, Micro soft bought back intothe Unix business by acquiring a substantial stake in the com pany.andP;  PyramidTechnology Corp revealed its challenge to the mainframe market with amulti-processor system rated at 140 MIPS running Unix, whilst Amdahl releasedversion 2 of its Unix-compat ible UTS operating system.andP;  Unisys continued itsspending spree by signing a $250m OEM deal with Sequent Computer Systems Inc,while Norsk Data began its rush into Unix fol lowing big financial losses.andM;March:andM;The UniForum trade show in San Francisco saw previ ously stubborn opensystems opponent Data General begin to fightback with its first RISC-basedMotorola 88000 AViiON workstations, and DEC's showstopper was a mul ti-userversion of its new DECstation line.andP;  Intel caused a stir with its 80860 RISCprocessor, claiming that workstation vendors that had already chosen theirnext generation of CPUs would now think again.andP;  ATandamp;T, Olivetti, Prime andConvergent began work on a multi-processing version of Unix for Intelprocessors - and rashly prom ised it for the end of the year.andP;  ATandamp;T hoped tosteal a yard on the Open Software Foundation's Motif interface by shippingsource code for its Open Look graphical user interface.andP;  Santa Cruz Operation - with a little help from its friends - announced a desktop graphicsand data base bundle for Unix called Open Desktop at less than $1,000 in achallenge to OS/2.andP;  The Japanese Nippon Mining Co sold Gould Comput erSystems to Encore Computer Corp - but Gould had to lend Encore $140m to dothe job - while minisuper makers Cy drome Inc and Scientific Com puterSystems fell under mar ket pressure, and the oper ating systems vendor Microport Inc was put up for sale.andM;April:andM;Intel Corp's predictions for the 80860 seemed to be borne out as StratusComputer Systems Inc changed tack and abandoned Motorola's 88000 in favour ofthe new chip - but Motorola shrugged it off by attempting to steal the thunder of Intel's much-awaited 80486 launch with a preview of its own 68040processor - it's still not formally &quot;ann ounced&quot;, while Tektronix launchedits 88000-based XD88 workstation line.andP;  Sun Micro systems held its firstmajor hardware launch for a year, with a blitz of new Sparc andMotorola-based systems, but again this was somewhat over shadowed by the newsthat Hewlett-Packard had put in an agreed bid for workstation pioneer ApolloComputer for $476m - pushing it ahead of Unisys and just behind DEC in size.andO;Franco-Italian giant SGS-Thomson Microelectronics bought up the UK'spromising Transputer technology with the acquisition of Inmos In ternational.andO;But while Control Data was shutting down its ETA supercomputer business,stirrings at the low-end of the market looked more encouraging, with &quot;mass-market&quot; dealerships for Bus inessland and MicroAge for IBM's AIX systems,newly an nounced for the PS/2.andP;  Bus inessland also took the NeXT computerfrom Steve Jobs.andP;  The Open Software Foundation issued its second Request forTechnology for a method of distributing software in a singlehardware-independent format.andP;  Following the virus scares at the end of 1988,trusted Unix grew hot, with Addamax and SecureWare offer ing new secureoperating sys tems technology.andP;  Pegasus Group stepped in as the last minutebuyer for Sphinx.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
