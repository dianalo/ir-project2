While that has never happened at Chrysler, which doesn't yet have a profit-sharing plan, it has been a contentious issue at General Motors Corp., which has done just that in the past two years.    &quot;We are sympathetic with the UAW's concern over the apparent disparity of treatment at General Motors,&quot; said Anthony P. St. John, Chrysler's top negotiator, at a news conference after the opening session. In a rare slap at another company for its labor-relations practices, Mr. St. John added, &quot;There is a public perception that it is unfair and we tend to agree with that.&quot;    A GM spokesman said only that, &quot;We do not think it would be appropriate for General Motors to comment on the Chrysler-UAW contract negotiations.&quot;    A UAW spokesman said the concept was &quot;generally appealing&quot; but the union needed to see specifics before it could respond.    While the Chrysler proclamation might sound statesmanlike, it might not mean that much in practice. First, Mr. St. John said the No. 3 auto maker disagreed with a union suggestion to tie the size of worker profit-sharing payments to executive bonuses, thus, at least theoretically, executives could still get huge bonuses while workers got minuscule profit sharing.    Besides, GM recently adopted a profit-sharing formula, which, if retroactively applied, would have generated payments to workers over the past two years. Chrysler will likely adopt that same formula in this set of talks.    Chrysler may also be trying to blunt criticism certain to come from the union today when the corporation releases its proxy statement that includes executive salaries and bonuses.    In addition, there are many ways executives can cash in besides receiving bonuses. During the company's bankruptcy brush, for example, Chairman Lee A. Iacocca gained national attention for getting paid only $1 in a year when workers were asked to take concessions.    But the following year he was reimbursed for that, and last year he took home a whopping $20.6 million, largely from stock grants promised during the troubled period, and from stock options awarded at that time.    Nonetheless, the announcement was an example of the symbolism, especially under the master promotional skills of Mr. Iacocca, which Chrysler uses so well.    Last year, the auto maker was embarrassed by government charges that it disconnected odometers during test drives, then selling them as completely new.    Mr. Iacocca called a news conference to admit the policy &quot;went beyond dumb and reached all the way out to stupid,&quot; and to extend warranties for the affected cars. That didn't satisfy all of the customers, however, and the company later had to pay $16.4 million to settle various criminal and civil charges.    Earlier this year, Chrysler tried to defuse the furor over its plans to close its Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant by promising to channel all profit from Wisconsin sales to affected workers. Chrysler, of course, stood to benefit by reviving sales lost in the state as a protest against the company.    In addition to making the bonus/profit-sharing pitch, Mr. St. John acknowledged that while he might like to break some new ground in the negotiations, &quot;We are realists at Chrylser and obviously a pattern has been set which establishes a framework from which (we) are going to be working.&quot; He was referring to contracts signed last year at Ford Motor Co. and GM. The UAW has made it clear it wants to duplicate those.    UAW President Owen Bieber said at a separate news conference that he expects to wrap up negotiations &quot;in the next two to three weeks.&quot; The current pact doesn't expire until September, but both sides wanted to open discussions early. The negotiations cover an estimated 60,000 hourly and salaried workers. </TEXT></DOC>
