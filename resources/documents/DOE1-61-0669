The development of mesophase andcrystalline order and the influences of coke optical texture on cokestrength and reactivity were discussed. The behavior of the free radicalin coking process of coal tar pitch has been studied using electron spinresonance analysis. 10 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
