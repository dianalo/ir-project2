Presenting an annual report on anti-dumpinginvestigations, a spokesman for the commission said thedocument proves that allegations the EC is using dumpingduties to &quot;build a fortress Europe&quot; are unfounded. Dumping isthe selling of a product in a foreign market at a price lowerthan the home-market price or the cost of production. He saidEC dumping policies were &quot;applied impartially to protect ECindustry against the practice of dumping, which is illegalunder GATT {the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, aGeneva-based trade regulator}.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The spokesman said the EC dealt with dumping cases fromstate trading nations in Eastern Europe as frequently as fromAsia. In 1988, the year covered by the report, the EC opened11 cases against Eastern European countries and the samenumber of cases against Japan and South Korea together.   But EC dumping actions against Japan and South Korea inrecent years have sparked disputes, because they tended toinvolve the lucrative consumer electronics industry, in whichEuropean companies are struggling to stay competitive.Dumping cases against Eastern Europe focus on metals,chemicals and plastics.   Also, the commission has been accused by Japanesecompanies, as well as some trade specialists, of using unfairmethods of calculation that lead to high dumping duties onJapanese products. As a result, the EC is under pressurewithin GATT to make its anti-dumping rules more transparent.   The report showed that 79 dumping investigations wereopened or under way during 1988, resulting in the impositionof 18 definitive and 28 provisional duties.</TEXT></DOC>
