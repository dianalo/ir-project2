The suits were brought on behalf of the state byCalifornia Attorney General Dan Lungren, by state assemblymanLloyd G. Connally and by the Environmental Defense Fund, arespected environmental group.</LP><TEXT>   The companies sued generally said that their productsdon't pose any health risk.   The actions are another effort by California regulatorsand environmental groups to change the way manufacturers maketheir products to eliminate potentially dangerous substances-- in this case lead in the glaze that goes on everythingfrom humble dinner plates to elegant teacups. Through suchregulatory actions, California exerts tremendous influence onhow industries respond nationwide to environmental problems.   But the plate case is touchy because it could reachvirtually every American household and because recent newsstories and scientific research have focused new attention onthe dangers of lead. David Roe, a senior attorney for theEnvironmental Defense Fund, emphasized that the allegationsdon't mean that &quot;it's plate-smashing time.&quot; Still, themanufacturers named in the suit accused their accusers ofinviting consumer panic.   The nine defendants include the some of the biggest namesin the plate industry, such as London-based Josiah Wedgewoodandamp; Sons Ltd. and a U.S. unit; Fitz andamp; Floyd Inc.; Lenox Inc., aunit of Brown-Forman Corp., Louisville, Ky.; and PfaltzgraffCo., York, Pa. Although there are thousands of ceramictableware manufacturers, the companies targeted make up a bigportion of a U.S. plate and fine-china market estimated at $2billion a year.   The suit alleges that products made by the companies leaklead that can contaminate food or beverages. It seeks toforce manufacturers either to meet California's lead limits-- which are 10 times more restrictive than recentlytoughened norms established by the federal Food and DrugAdministration -- or to put labels on their products warningof the hazards of lead.   But the suits were short on specifics. For example, theplaintiffs didn't list which products made by whichmanufacturers exceeded California's lead limits. Nor do thelawsuits say what impact on human health may come from usingthe products of the companies named. While there are severaldocumented cases of humans suffering lead poisoning fromceramicware, none have involved products made by thecompanies targeted by the suits. The companies generally saidthat their products meet federal guidelines.   Indeed, Mr. Roe said that the plaintiffs can't be surewhich products violate the California standards. He said thestate had requested that the companies provide data on leadlevels in their products, but that they refused. Thecompanies acknowledged that, but said they didn't provide theinformation because the Environmental Defense Fund wasattaching unacceptable conditions.   Mr. Roe said defense-fund testing showed that someproducts made by the defendants exceed even federalstandards; he cited a Wedgewood plate that tested at 3,400parts per billion of lead, nearly 15 times the state standardand 13% above the new federal mark of 3,000 parts perbillion. Wedgewood officials couldn't be reached for comment.   &quot;We're not saying every plate in every cupboard isdangerous, but we are saying that there is a considerablelead problem in some ceramic and china products, and we'renot sure which ones,&quot; Mr. Roe said.   Nonetheless, some targets of the suit complained that thecase could promote consumer hysteria. &quot;I'm concerned that theway this is presented will promote fear and panic that couldmean chaos,&quot; said William H. Simpson, president of closelyheld Pfaltzgraff. &quot;It conveys the impression to consumersthat there's a danger here that in fact does not exist.&quot;   The Environmental Defense Fund and some of the companiessued agree that new, lead-free glazes can be used on someproducts to reduce lead content. And some companies arebetter positioned to get the lead out than others: Thedefense fund said all the ceramicware sold by Corning Inc. inCalifornia already is lead-free. Industry executives saidthat's because Corning specializes in so-called glassceramics, which don't require the same type of manufacturingprocesses that some other products do.</TEXT></DOC>
