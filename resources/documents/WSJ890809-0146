Nicholas Rowe, who was assassinated by Philippines communists in April: I'd like Mr. Banko to know that not all of us pick our heroes according to the amount of press they generate. Although I'm in my 20s and may never know the feeling of being in a war, I feel a tug in my heart every time I read of a true hero such as Nick Rowe, who paid the ultimate price for his love of America.    It may be somewhat heartening for Mr. Banko to understand that there are Americans and, perhaps more important, young Americans who love this country just as much. We would never confuse the ramblings of a &quot;lovable guy&quot; like Abbie Hoffman with the silent convictions of a Nick Rowe, convictions that form the very backbone of America.    Mark J.McCall    Tampa, Fla.    ---   It's strange how we often come to idolize those covered in the media.    Mr. Hoffman, a popular, left-wing radical of the 1960s died of a drug overdose after serving a sentence on a drug-abuse charge. His death inspired numerous editorials and significant network coverage. Col. Rowe's death received but a fraction of the attention. Yet, here was a man who quietly carried out his orders; believed in and loved his country, despite serving as a POW for five years in a war few care to remember. That's a hero in my book.    In the end, Abbie Hoffman died as a burned-out symbol of an era's mostly bankrupt philosophy. Col. Rowe died in the continuing fight against communism and trying to uphold those democratic values that shall endure.    Keith R. Cook    Laguna Niguel, Calif.    ---   Mr. Banko presents a provocative juxtaposition of lives, but he fails to understand why Mr. Hoffman's passing earned so much publicity. He can only attribute the coverage to Mr. Hoffman's &quot;fascination with the media.&quot;    I was one of millions in the U.S. and Europe in the '60 and '70s who believed America's war in Vietnam was immoral and pointless. Mr. Hoffman, despite his eccentricities, helped provide us with a much-needed alternative viewpoint on the war than that promulgated by our heads of state. We can thank Mr. Hoffman for his courage and leadership, and for putting his personal liberty at stake by his protests.    None of Mr. Hoffman's insight diminishes the heroics and selflessness of Col. Rowe, whose career Mr. Banko justly extols. But Mr. Banko should realize that Mr. Hoffman and Col. Rowe shared the qualities Mr. Banko and all of us hold dear: deep love of country, and the willingness to sacrifice for its behalf.    Paul K. Penniman    Washington </TEXT></DOC>
