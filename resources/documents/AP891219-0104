A spokesman for the military command in Lima said one armysergeant was killed and two soldiers were wounded in the battlewith rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.   The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the battletook place Sunday in a remote jungle region along the IscozacinRiver, 175 miles northeast of Lima in Pasco department.   The spokesman said army troops recovered arms and explosives aswell as radios, medicine, tents, uniforms and food.   Sunday's battle was the most serious defeat for the rebels sinceApril 28, when an army patrol wiped out a column of 62 guerrillason a mountain road near Jauja, 105 miles east of Lima.   The guerrilla movement, which advocates a Cuban-style Marxism,has been fighting Peru's elected government since 1984. Estimatesof the size of the organization range from 500 to 1,500.   It is smaller and considered less violent than the Shining Path,a fanatical, Maoist guerrilla group that launched its insurgency in1980.   The government says more than 17,000 people have died in theviolence since 1980, including police, soldiers, rebels, governmentofficials and civilians.  </TEXT></DOC>
