Ltd. last year.andM;The result is the Dual SX-16 which has the ability to run in either NEC- orIBMcompatible mode  but not both at the same time).andP;  The backplane ports(parallel, serial, and mouse) are afl 9801-compatible and there is onededicated slot for a 9801 graphics controller (still a separate card in theNEC and not integrated like the VGA controller in many American PCs).andP;  Butall of the other seven board connectors (two 8-bit and five 16bit slots) areISA-compatible and will only take American expansion boards.andP;  In other words,for a Japanese customer, you get a mixed bag - a little PC compatibility anda little NEC compatibility, and no clear definition of the value of themachine.andM;The manufacturers justify the dual-mode machine on the basis that it runsAmerican software unmodified  in the PC mode) so that Japanese customers canget access to both Japanese and American software.andP;  I've heard the notionthat Japanese customers want American software from a variety of parties -Microsoft when it was &quot; to sell the concept of the AX standard (aKanji-capable PC compatible), Proside and others when it originallyintroduced the idea of a dual-mode machine, as well as companies that havesimply tried selling American PC-compatibles to Japanese trading houses.andP;  Andyet japanese customers keep buying japanese machines that only run Japanesesoftware (including modified Japanese software).andP;  I wonder why.andP;  And Lotusmanaged to make the number-one software product in Japan, despite the factthat Microsoft had already established a significant presence for arelatively unmodified product (Multiplan), by heavily modifying its Americanprogram specifically for the japanese market  1-2-3j).andP;  1 wonder why.andM;What's fascinating about the Japanese market is the degree to which it issimiliar to the U.S.andP;  market, despite the differences in custom, businesspractice, and language.andP;  When Digital introduced the Rainbow computer in 1982with a dual-BIOS design (including MS-DOS- and CP/M-compatibility), customersrejected it as they have rejected every single computer designed to becompatible with two standards.andP;  And the reason they rejected it is that sucha computer is designed for the convenience of the manufacturer, not theconvenience of the customer.andP;  In Japan, customers have consistently expresseda preference for NEC-compatible computers by buying 60% or more of thecomputers sold for the last four years in an NEC-compatible configuration.andO;They have already rejected the idea of a dual-compatible machine twice.andP;  Andit is hard to imagine that they will take a chance on a relatively smallAmerican PC manufacturer selling a machine containing p@ components that werefeatured in two computers that have already failed in the market.andM;If AST Research were to offer a real NEC-compatible machine under their ownlabel and use their extensive engineering resources to turn it into aperformance computer, then there's a good chance that Japanese customersmight well be willing to take a chance on a relatively small Americanmanufacturer.andP;  The company still has the opportunity to do this, since theintroduction of even manufacturing protob&quot;s of the Dual SX-16 is still atleast 60 days away, according to AST.andP;  How about it, Safi and Tom?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
