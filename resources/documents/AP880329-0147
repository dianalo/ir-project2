(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart today wasbarred from the pulpit for at least a year and ordered not toappear on his television show for a year in connection withallegations he hired a prostitute to pose naked.   The Assemblies of God suspended Swaggart as a minister for twoyears, effective immediately, said a church spokeswoman. That meanshe cannot preach until he has undergone at least a year ofrehabilitation and may be required to limit his preaching longer,she said.   Swaggart was ordered to undergo rehabilitation for two years.   The Pentecostal church's General Presbytery had the final say onthe fiery preacher's punishment. Its decision was more severe thanthe three-month suspension recommended by the Louisiana branch ofthe church.   Gus Weill, a spokesman for Jimmy Swaggart Worldwide Ministriesin Baton Rouge, La., declined immediate comment.   People approved by the church would supervise Swaggart'srehabilitation, the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendentof the church, said at a news conference. He provided no otherdetails about the sanctions.   The rehabilitation period would begin when Swaggart agreed tothe terms in writing. He has 30 days to respond.   Carlson said he had notified Swaggart of the decision.   ``He thanked me,'' Carlson said. ``He expressed thanks, and Ihad prayer with him over the telephone.''   A member of the General Presbytery, H. Maurice Lednicky, saidmost of the discussion in its two-day meeting was over the power ofthe 13-member Executive Presbytery to impose punishment.   The Louisiana District had imposed a three-month suspension fromthe pulpit for Swaggart and had refused to reconsider that onrequest of the Executive Presbytery, which sought a stifferpenalty. The executive board noted that every other Assemblies ofGod minister who has confessed to moral failure has been barredfrom the pulpit for at least a year, officials said.   At the meeting, it was agreed that the Executive Presbytery hadconstitutional authority in the case, and the punishment givenSwaggart was the same that the Executive Presbytery had originallyrecommended, said Lednicky, president of the Assemblies of GodCentral Bible College in Springfield.   The 206 presbyters present from the 232-member body reconvenedat 9 a.m. after working late Monday and ended their meeting twohours later.   ``This is not a meeting to determine the guilt or innocence ofJimmy Swaggart; he has already confessed,'' church spokeswomanJuleen Turnage said earlier. ``They are here to make a decision onwhat will be done with his credentials.''   The Assemblies of God, the nation's largest Pentecostaldenomination, is headquartered in Springfield.   Swaggart tearfully stepped down from his Baton Rouge, La.,pulpit Feb. 21, admitting unspecified sins. Published reports havesaid he paid a prostitute to pose naked.   Debra Murphree, who says she is the woman who posed, will appearin the July issue of Penthouse magazine, a spokeswoman for thepublication said Monday.   ``From what I understand, the photographs will recreate theprecise poses and actions that Jimmy Swaggart paid for,'' LeslieJay, vice president and director of public relations for Penthouse,said in a telephone interview from her New York office.   Jay said she had not seen the pictures or an interview withMurphree. She said she didn't know how much Murphree was paid.   The General Presbytery was directed by the Executive Presbyteryon March 3 to take up the Swaggart case.   Three representatives of the Louisiana district attendedMonday's meeting, which was chaired by Carlson.   Mrs. Turnage said Carlson briefed the presbyters on Swaggart'stransgession and the presbyters were given documentation. Nowitnesses were called and Swaggart did not appear.</TEXT></DOC>
