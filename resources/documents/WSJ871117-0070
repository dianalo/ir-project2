Boone Pickens Jr., disclosed that it owned 4.8% of Homestake Mining Corp. and 4.5% of KN Energy Inc. as of Sept. 30.    It isn't clear whether Mesa still holds its stakes in Homestake or KN, and Mesa officials declined to elaborate on the filing. But if Mesa raised its stake in those companies to 5% or more, it would be required to file with the SEC within 10 business days of reaching that level of ownership.    Mesa, an Amarillo, Texas-based oil and gas partnership, also said it had reduced its Boeing Co. stake to 6,100 shares from 250,000 shares.    Mesa made the disclosures in a quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing, required when a filer's marketable securities exceed $100 million.    The filing said that on Sept. 30, Mesa managed a partnership that owned 2,250,000 Homestake shares. Mesa, by itself, owned 404,900 KN shares, more than double the 163,400 shares it held as of June 30.    Mesa had $823 million in marketable securities as of Sept. 30, a sharp increase from the $123.5 million it held as of June 30.    In San Francisco, Harry M. Conger, Homestake's chairman and chief executive officer, said he had only just learned of the Mesa stake and declined to comment until the company had more details. &quot;We have the customary&quot; anti-takeover measures, Mr. Conger said, citing a poison-pill shareholder rights plan and staggered terms for directors. But, he said, &quot;until we've read (the filing), I'm not going to speculate&quot; on their potential for deterring a hostile suitor.    In Lakewood, Colo., a KN spokesman said the company hasn't seen the Mesa filing and didn't have any comment. Mesa has invested in KN off and on since 1983. In Seattle, a spokesman for Boeing, which has 155.4 million shares outstanding, declined comment.    In the first nine months of 1987, Homestake's net income, helped in part by a $5.7 million gain from sale of mineral properties, more than tripled to $34.4 million, or 71 cents a share, from $10.8 million, or 22 cents. The company has said it expects to post a $95 million gain in the current quarter from the public offering in Europe and Australia of a 20% stake in its Homestake Gold of Australia Ltd. unit.    Homestake's board, citing increased earnings, the outlook for continuing strong gold prices and the Australian unit's offering, in September approved a 2-for-1 stock split, payable yesterday to holders of record Nov. 2.    Homestake has interests in mining and oil and gas. KN Energy operates natural gas and mineral businesses.    As of Sept. 30, Mesa's holdings also included about half of a 9.95% stake in Newmont Mining Corp. Mesa, as part of a group known as Ivanhoe Partners, has extended a tender offer to acquire 28 million Newmont shares to Nov. 19. But Ivanhoe has been effectively defeated in its bid to buy more Newmont shares because of a &quot;street sweep&quot; conducted last month by Consolidated Gold Fields PLC. The sweep, completed in only two days, allowed Gold Fields to boost its Newmont stake to 49.7% from 26% of the company's shares outstanding.    Mesa on Sept. 30 also held about one million shares, or 4.9%, of Singer Co. As previously reported, Mesa has since more than doubled its Singer stake to 2.1 million shares, or 9.9% of the company. But Mesa has said it doesn't plan to acquire Singer, which is the target of a $50-a-share hostile offer by Florida investor Paul Bilzerian.    Nor could it be learned how much, if anything, Mesa had in losses on its various stockholdings as a result of last month's market crash. The Sept. 30 market value of the Mesa-led partnership's Homestake holdings was $102.4 million, or $45.50 a share.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Homestake closed yesterday at $28.75 a share, down 37.5 cents, on volume of 120,400 shares. However, it wasn't known what Mesa paid for its Homestake shares, which between July 1 and Sept. 30 traded between $35.375 and $48.125. According to previous filings, Mesa didn't hold its Homestake shares prior to July 1.    On Sept. 30, Mesa's KN shares had a market value totaling $6.3 million, or $15.63 a share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, KN closed yesterday at $15.375 a share, up 37.5 cents, on volume of 39,300 shares.    Early last year, Mesa was rebuffed in its $24-a-share, or $216 million, bid for KN. The natural gas gathering and distribution concern said its board rejected Mesa's offer as &quot;inadequate.&quot;    Mesa first disclosed its interest in Boeing last July, when it indicated plans to buy more than $15 million of Boeing's common shares and received U.S. permission to buy as much as a 15% stake in the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturing and defense concern. But Mesa seems to have quickly abandoned whatever plans it had for ownership of Boeing shares. </TEXT></DOC>
