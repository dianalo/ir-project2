(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two years after they crashed the stateDemocratic Party and helped to make their leader a household name,Lyndon LaRouche's Illinois disciples have resurfaced again on thestate primary election ballot.   Despite challenges from the Democratic Party, LaRouche and morethan 20 of his supporters are in the running in the party's primaryon Tuesday for posts ranging from president to county recorder ofdeeds.   For state party leaders, it's an unwelcome reminder of the upsetvictories of two LaRouche followers in the 1986 Democratic primary,an event that threw the party into disarray.   ``We fell down on our job in `86,'' said state Sen. VinceDemuzio, who became state Democratic Party chairman after theprimary debacle. ``Nobody gave them much chance to do anything andwe ended up with two of them on our ticket. We don't intend toallow that again.''   For the LaRouche supporters, it's another chance to air theperennial presidential candidate's world view, in which variousconspiracies link AIDS, drugs, international bankers and theBritish royal family.   The 1986 victories of LaRouche's Illinois followers marked thebeginning of a period of heightened scrutiny that culminated inraids by authorities on LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., headquarters andhis indictment in Boston on federal obstruction-of-justice charges.   His supporters see these actions as a conspiracy by theDemocratic Party and the Soviet Union, who they believe are tryingto block LaRouche from gaining political power.   ``If this man is such a wacko fringe candidate, why is theDemocratic Party spending all of this money to keep him out of theelection?'' said Sheila Jones, a leader of the LaRoucheorganization in Illinois.   Demuzio has a ready answer.   ``He has repudiated the platform and leadership of the partynationally and in Illinois,'' he said. ``We're not going to affordthese fringe candidates the chance to have the Democratic Party astheir haven.''   But Illinois Democrats succeeded in only one of a flurry ofchallenges to LaRouche-backed candidacies, leaving LaRouche and aplatoon of followers on the ballot:   LaRouche's name will appear throughout the state on the March 15Democratic presidential preference ballot. In four Chicago-areacongressional districts, LaRouche followers have filed full slatesof would-be delegates to the Democratic National Convention.   LaRouche supporters will be on the ballot for Congress in atleast five districts, mostly in the Chicago area.   And Janice Hart, one of the LaRouche supporters who won in 1986,is running for Cook County Circuit Court clerk.   Perhaps as a result of their 1986 success, LaRouche supportersseem to have focused their efforts in Illinois, political observerssay.   In the 10 other states where Democratic primary election filingdeadlines have passed, only four congressional candidates have beenidentified as LaRouche disciples, said Peggy Connolly, spokeswomanfor the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.   ``It's a natural consequence of what they perceive as theirsuccess there (in Illinois) in 1986,'' she said. ``They've losttheir wind in every other region of the country.''   Democratic party leaders and candidates say the LaRouchefollowers' campaigns in Illinois seem to have begun and ended withthe filing of nominating petitions to get on the primary ballot.   With their legal challenges stymied, Democratic Party leadershave focused their anti-LaRouche efforts on mailings to voters inthe areas where LaRouche followers are on the ballot.   Cook County Democrats are circulating almost 3 million brochureswarning voters that ``the LaRouchies have invaded'' the ballot andurging them to be careful when casting their votes.   Some Democrats have discussed the possibility of rewriting stateelection law to allow party leaders to ``screen'' candidatesseeking to run in the party primary, though they acknowledge doubtsabout the constitutionality of such a measure.   But Demuzio and other party leaders believe public disdain isthe only effective political weapon against LaRouche followers.   ``I don't know how you keep them from getting on the ballot,''Demuzio said. ``This is America, you know.''</TEXT></DOC>
