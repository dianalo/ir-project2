The New York-based rating agency, as expected, lowered its ratings on the long-term debt of 20 Australian issuers to double-A-2 from double-A-1. The downgrade affects $23 billion of Australia's estimated $66 billion of foreign currency obligations, a senior Moody's official said.    In recent years, Australia has proved unable to rein in surging domestic demand and has encouraged imports and discouraged exports by pursuing tight monetary policies that have boosted the value of the Australian dollar.    In consequence, Australia's current-account deficit has grown the past two years, rising to 5.2% of gross domestic product in 1989, according to Moody's. The resulting rise in the country's foreign-currency debt has led Moody's to conclude there is &quot;a small but significant increase in the likelihood that Australian borrowers could, at some future date, experience difficulty in accessing the foreign currency to service that debt,&quot; the rating agency said in a statement.    &quot;Australia's foreign debt will continue to rise,&quot; said David H. Levey, an associate director at Moody's and head of its sovereign-risk unit. Mr. Levey also doesn't expect that Australia's foreign-debt position will stabilize until the mid-1990s. The downgrading by Moody's places Australia on a level with Spain. Previously, Australia was ranked with Norway, Belgium and Denmark. In May, Moody's announced the possibility of a downgrade, which drew strong criticism from Australia.    In Australia, Treasurer Paul Keating called Moody's decision &quot;ill-founded&quot; and said &quot;there is no justification for such a change.&quot; He said that over the past two years, the Australian government hasn't borrowed from abroad and, indeed, has repaid nearly 5 billion Australian dollars (US$3.81 billion) of foreign debt. The government currently owes foreign creditors a total of about A$9.25 billion, and Mr. Keating said that debt is more than offset by Australia's foreign reserves of around A$20 billion.    The government announced earlier this month that it intends to repay the equivalent of a further A$1.75 billion of foreign debt. In the year ending June 30, the government expects to post a record budget surplus of A$9 billion, and it is from that surplus that the Australian government will reduce its foreign debt obligations, it said.    In a statement issued in response to Moody's action, Mr. Keating said the government already would have repaid more of its foreign debt &quot;but for difficulties&quot; in getting its debt securities &quot;out of the hands of U.S. and other overseas holders.&quot; He noted that the government also has been reducing its domestic debt. As of June 30, 1989, Australia owed A$66.5 billion in short-term and long-term debt to both foreign and domestic creditors.    But although the government has been reducing its own foreign debt, that has been more than offset by borrowing abroad by Australian-based companies and others. That is partly because Australia's economy has been running hot in recent months, causing a surge in imports that has ballooned the current-account deficit. That, in turn, has swelled the country's foreign debt, which currently stands at a total of about US$98 billion at current exchange rates, including some debt denominated in Australian dollars that is owed to creditors abroad.    Moody's criticizes Australia's capacity to build its exports and generate productivity gains, particularly during the recent past when the world economy has been growing and commodity prices have been relatively buoyant. The country, which relies on commodities for most of its exports, also is &quot;ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign-currency debt,&quot; the rating agency said.    As a result of Moody's action yesterday, the outstanding-rated senior bonds and notes -- denominated in currencies other than Australian dollars -- of the following borrowers have been downgraded to double-A-2: Australian Industry Development Corp.; Australian Resources Development Bank; Australian Wheat Board; Commonwealth of Australia; Commonwealth Bank of Australia; National Australia Bank Ltd.; National Mutual Group Finance Ltd.; New South Wales Treasury Corp.; Qantas Airways Ltd.; Queensland Treasury Corp.; South Australian Government Financing Authority; State Bank of New South Wales; State Bank of South Australia; State Bank of Victoria; State Electricity Commission of Victoria; Sumitomo International Finance Australia Ltd.; Victorian Public Authorities Finance Agency; and Western Australian Treasury Corp.    In addition, the preferred stock of First Australia Prime Income Fund Inc. was downgraded to double-A-2. And the long-term bank deposit ratings of Westpac Banking Corp. also were downgraded to double-A-2.    Moody's stressed that long-term debt denominated in Australian dollars isn't affected by the downgrade.    ---   S. Karene Witcher contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
