A smug assertion, perhaps, coming from those who hadn'tbeen at the Battle of the Bulge. Yet there was some truth toit. Our military arsenal and tactics circa 1967 were not, infact, well suited to combating guerrilla warfare in SoutheastAsian jungles. There were too few front lines, too fewsignificant military targets. We faced an enemy genuinelymotivated by some combination of nationalism and communistideology. Ho Chi Minh never quite came across as evilincarnate. Our own cause was unclear, our politicalleadership indecisive, our public impatient, our nationdivided.</LP><TEXT>   However just our cause, and it was, the Vietnam War wasone in which pessimism paid -- at least if you were a pundit.   This time around, however, the roles are reversed. In thePersian Gulf the U.S. military is waging today's -- and eventomorrow's -- warfare while the pundits of the airwaves andelsewhere seem all too intent on reliving our last war inthis new time and different place.   This paradox has been punching through our TV screensnightly over the past six months as a parade of politiciansand think-tankers, columnists and commentators, retiredgenerals and former ambassadors, and assorted &quot;Mideastexperts&quot; and other rent-a-pundits have subjected us to analmost liturgical litany of problems and plagues about tobefall the House of Bush.   &quot;Bush's deep dilemma . . . the presidential quandary . . .deep public divisions . . . large anti-war protests . . .vast ecological damage . . . shocking civilian casualties . .. fragile, fraying alliance . . . outraged Arab masses . . .disastrous Israeli intervention . . . Saddam wins by losing .. . the U.S. may lose by winning. . . .&quot; We've heard themall, and more. And one suspects that many Americans haveincreasingly wondered what war the pundits are talking about.   Punditry, of course, is a risky business in the best ofcircumstances. This war has provided us with more punditrythan ever before, in part because the demand of open air timehas greatly exceeded the supply of news and in part becauseof press restrictions by the U.S. and other governments. A24-hour news channel is a wondrous thing but, at least untilthe land war began, there hasn't been anywhere near 24 hoursa day of news. Thus, we've seen a pundit shortage so severethat the Yemeni ambassador to the U.N., a man devoid ofknowledge, balance or influence, was a prize catch on threenetworks Monday night.   Beyond that, of course, our first war televised in &quot;realtime&quot; gives the poor pundits less time than ever to thinkbefore they speak, leading to a barnyard syndrome in whichChicken Little proclaims the sky is falling, to be instantlyechoed by Turkey Lurkey, Goosey Loosey and Gander Lander.   Whatever the reasons, herewith -- and, yes, with thebenefit of brief hindsight -- is a sampling of Persian Gulfpunditry that has been remarkably out of touch with simplefacts, common sense and prevailing public views:                                                                                                          -- The U.S. began this war on Jan. 16. A factual error.Saddam Hussein began the war Aug. 2 by invading Kuwait. TheU.S.-led alliance responded in force on Jan. 16.                                                                                                          -- Israel would enter the war, spelling disaster for theanti-Iraq coalition. Aside from the fact that it didn'thappen, it was never a very logical assumption. Israelbenefits both by having the U.S. destroy Saddam's war machineand by demonstrating to the world its own restraint underprovocation. What target, after all, would Israel havedestroyed that we haven't? But, beyond that, where ever wasthe evidence that Israeli entry into the war would haveshattered the alliance?                                                                                                          -- The anti-Saddam coalition is a fragile house of cards,posing constant diplomatic quandaries for Mr. Bush. Why? Thenations that have made real combat commitments to thecoalition, including Arab nations, have done so out ofself-interest and in some cases self-preservation, to savetheir skins from Saddam, not to please the U.S. or build anew world order. By contrast, countries that live to please,notably Japan and Germany, made no combat contribution.National self-interest is what motivates countries intoconflict. And, from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to Syria, there wasplenty of it. The only real risk all along was that the U.S.would shy away from all-out combat, leaving Arab alliesexposed. That, of course, wasn't high risk either givenSaddam's intransigence and Mr. Bush's resolve.                                                                                                          -- Mr. Bush's domestic support for going to war was thin,fragile, fraying. A nice theory, perhaps, but never supportedby public-opinion polls that showed strong support steadilywidening and hardening. Perhaps some of the pundits misreadcongressional opinion as reflecting public opinion. That'sunderstandable, since almost half of the Senate misreadpublic opinion too. In this case, it was Mr. Bush who read itright all along and Sen. Sam Nunn who got it all wrong.                                                                                                          -- &quot;Peace&quot; demonstrations, in front of the White House andin a few other cities, were the tip of an iceberg. Actually,despite all the initial TV coverage, the demonstrationsturned out to be merely an ice cube that has steadily melted.                                                                                                          -- Saddam Hussein is an incalculably clever foe. Actually,he has miscalculated and mismanaged at every step of the way,from misreading American resolve and thus being taken bysurprise on Jan. 16, to torturing U.S. POWs, to callingvainly for an Arab &quot;jihad,&quot; to vastly underestimating theeffectiveness of aerial warfare, to playing patently spurious&quot;peace&quot; gambits, to trusting his old Soviet pals to save himfrom the endgame. May all our enemies always be so smart.                                                                                                          -- The &quot;elite&quot; Iraqi Republican Guard will fight to thedeath. By reputation, at least among pundits, it's one of theworld's most fearsome fighting forces. In fact, its militaryglory was mostly earned mowing down primitively armed Iranianteen-agers and, of course, defending Saddam from his ownpeople. Defenders of Masada these are not. Some RepublicanGuard units may yet stand and fight, inflicting casualities,but so far the indications are they'd rather melt away.                                                                                                          -- A giant oil slick, the greatest ecological disasterever, would smother Saudi Arabia. TV footage of oil-bathedbirds tugged at many heartstrings. But the epic oil disasterturned out to be rather more hysteric than historic and haslargely gone with the wind.                                                                                                          -- The war must be over by the Muslim holidays of Ramadan.As it turns out, the war probably will be. But the whole ideathat Arab armies (except, of course, Saddam's) would go homefor the holidays never quite made sense when you considerthat Muslims have been fighting through holy days for athousand years or so, give or take a few centuries.                                                                                                          -- The air war was somehow too antiseptic, a &quot;Nintendowar&quot; in which the American public was prevented fromexperiencing the true horrors of war. This one was brought tous by some of the same voices that soon raised alarums aboutmassive civilian casualties from the air war and the prospectof massive U.S. military casualties from a ground war.                                                                                                          -- The air war was causing horrifying civilian casualties.This chorus reached a crescendo after an air strike on aBaghdad military complex that also, apparently, was beingused as a civilian air shelter. Up to several hundredcivilians may have died. Those TV shots from Baghdad ofburned bodies and screaming women were replayed on our TVscreens with the regularity of commercials. And even thevenerable New York Times gave the air strike a six-columnbanner headline, as if reporting Hiroshima. Whatever thefacts, what was missing was simple perspective. People die inwars, even civilians. In this war, because of the precisionof high-tech bombing, relatively few civilians have died.   -- Military restrictions on the press are denying theAmerican public its right to know what's going on. The pressrestrictions may or may not be unnecessarily tight, but thereis a problem with the high-decibel and mildly patronizingdebate over what's best for &quot;the public.&quot; To the extent pollsreflect opinion, most people seem untroubled by restrictionsthat limit their right to know everything the minute ithappens.                                                                                                          -- Bombing would be ineffectual in forcing Saddam out ofKuwait, necessitating bloody ground war with massive U.S.casualties. This has been a frequent refrain in recent weeks,mostly brought to us by the same pundits who argued beforethe air war began that an economic embargo alone would bringSaddam to his knees. Why an embargo alone would be effectivewhereas embargo-plus-bombing would not is more than mildlyperplexing. And with the ground war now in full motion, sofar the massive U.S. casualties many pundits predictedhaven't materialized.                                                                                                          -- A wave of terrorism, unleashed by Saddam, would strikeEurope and the U.S. Some of this may still happen, of course,in a world in which terrorism takes place with or withoutwars. So far, however, the effects of the terrorist wave aresimply seen in empty airline seats on European routes.                                                                                                          -- Arab masses in the Middle East and wider Muslim worldwould rise in support of Saddam, threatening regimes alliedwith the U.S. Anti-American sentiment clearly exists in someMuslim countries, but we have yet to see a regime seriouslythreatened by it. The only sure fact is that such regimeswould have been threatened by Saddam's armies had thecoalition not defeated him in Kuwait.                                                                                                          -- The U.S. public was overly optimistic, even dangerouslyeuphoric, about how speedily and successfully the war wouldbe concluded. Indeed, we found ourselves being lectured onthis point on Day Two of the air war by, among others, thesame CNN pundit who told us on Day One that Iraq's entire airforce and Republican Guard had been decimated. Actually, thepublic seems to have held a very realistic assessment ofspeed and success in large part by listening to the voices ofMessrs. Bush, Cheney, Powell and Schwarzkopf or to theworking press accurately reporting their statements.                                                                                                          -- By bombing in or around Baghdad we might be targetingSaddam Hussein himself, thereby violating Executive Order12333 banning political assassinations. We apparently weren'ttargeting Saddam. But had we, what bizarre legal or morallogic could argue against it? Pundits, however, were able todebate the issue much as theologians once argued over howmany angels could cohabitate on the head of a pin.                                                                                                          -- The handful of Democratic senators who broke anti-warranks to support President Bush's authority to go to warwould be in deep political doo-doo. It now appears they willbe the only ones with the requisite credential to challenge apopular President Bush in 1992.                                                                                                          -- The U.S. is escalating the war with a militaryoffensive that will not just push Iraq out of Kuwait, butthat might also push Saddam out of power. The technicaldistinction is that the former is an official goal, thelatter widespread hope. The reality is that while gettingIraq out of Kuwait may result in getting Saddam out of power,getting him out of power surely will result in no moreKuwaits.                                                                                                          -- The U.S. is, or will be perceived to be, beating up ona poor Third World nation, thus alienating the Third World. AThird World nation, in this case, with the world'sfourth-largest army, chemical and biological weapons inproduction, and nuclear weapons under development. Iraq isn'texactly Bangladesh. But that's beside the real point, whichis the logic of responding militarily to any nation thatmilitarily threatens the vital national interests of America.Strength is no sin and weakness no virtue, no matter whatsome Third World diplomat might say (as opposed to think).                                                                                                          -- Soviet and Iraqi peace proposals pose deep dilemmas forPresident Bush. As a point of fact, Mr. Bush, backed by histwo dozen coalition partners, has had no trouble at allspurning the spurious peace proposals and countering with hisown clear and simple ultimatums. But the whole idea of deepdilemmas for the U.S. flies in the face of common sense. Itis losers, not winners, who face deep dilemmas. And thiswar's losers, it's been clear for some time now, are Iraq andits sometime Soviet supporter.                                                                                                          -- Saddam will wind up winning by losing. Even in defeat,indeed particularly in defeat, he will be left as a hero tothe Arab world, or so the argument goes. We'll see. But itbegs a good deal of credulity to believe that a man who hasled his nation into a war as disastrous and humiliating asthis one will emerge as hero to his own people or any others.The surprise, rather, will be if he survives at all.                                                                                                          -- The U.S. will wind up losing by winning. The thrust ofthis pessimistic punditry is that in winning the war the U.S.somehow becomes responsible for resolving all the problems ofthe Middle East. If they can't all be solved, we fail. All ofwhich merely proves that if you set a bar high enough itcannot be hurdled. But then, whoever promised peace andtranquillity in a part of the world that has never known it?Then, too, if these pundits believe we lose by winning, dothey conversely believe we'd win by losing?                                                                                                          -- Pessimism pays. It has been an Iron Law of Punditryever since the Vietnam War. And we've all heard a lot of itin recent months. But it's becoming more apparent each daythat this iron law is becoming one of the most significantcasualties of the Persian Gulf conflict.   ---   Mr. Kann, an aspiring pundit, is publisher of the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
