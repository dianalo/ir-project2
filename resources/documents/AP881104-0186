The Federal Open Market Committee, which establishes monetarypolicy for the central bank, voted 12-0 to make no further moves totighten credit conditions.   But officials let it be known that the central bank stillconsidered higher inflation a greater threat to the economy than apossible recession.   The Fed, whose main economic job is to guard against inflation,began a series of credit-tightening steps late last March thatculminated in August with a one-half percentage point increase inits discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans. Thediscount rate now stands at 6.5 percent.   But since that increase, many economists believe the central bankhas been willing to sit back and see if the credit-tightening movesalready initiated would be enough to dampen demand and cool anydangers of overheating.   The minutes of the Sept. 20 minute showed that Fed officials werestill taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed officials said theywere encouraged by indications that economic growth was slowing fromthe robust pace in the first half of the year.   Indeed, the government has since reported that the overalleconomy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at amodest 2.2 percent annual rate from July through September, downfrom a 3.2 percent rate in the first half of the year.   But even with signs that the economy was slowing, Fed officialsargued that it was too soon to declare a victory in the fightagainst inflation.   ``All of the members indicated that the balance of risks in theeconomy were such that they favored or could accept a marketdirective that would more readily accommodate a move toward firmingthan an adjustment toward easing in the weeks ahead,'' the minutessaid.   The FOMC minutes are used to direct the open market operations ofthe Federal Reserve Bank in New York. Through the purchase ofgovernment securities from banks, the Fed influences the amount ofreserves the banks have to make bank loans and thus the price ofthose loans _ interest rates.   While the vote for leaving monetary policy unchanged wasunanimous, the minutes indicated there was some dispute over justhow much further the Fed should go in fighting inflation.   Some members of the policymaking group ``were less persuaded thatinflationary pressures would intensify, especially given the degreeof policy restraint that already had been implemented over the pastseveral months,'' the minutes said.   These officials argued that the troubled condition of many banksand savings and loan institutions could be adversely affected byfurther increases in interest rates.   Many economists expect that the Fed will begin pushing interestrates up again sometime after Tuesday's election. They said thereport Friday that unemployment dropped to 5.3 percent in October,matching a 14-year low, would renew concerns at the central bankconcerning tight labor markets and rising wage demands.   ``Because the employment report was clearly strong, there islittle reason to believe that the Fed will back off any time soonfrom its current policy of monetary restraint,'' said ThomasCarpenter, chief economist for ASB Capital Management, a Washington,D.C., investment firm.   Fed officials met again this week to discuss monetary policy. Theminutes of that meeting will not be released until after the nextFOMC meeting on Dec. 13-14.</TEXT></DOC>
