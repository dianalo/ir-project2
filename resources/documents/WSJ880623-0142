The proposed rules would lead to monitoring of wells, as well as restrictions and possibly a ban on aldicarb in some areas to prevent further contamination of drinking water.    The pesticide, sold under the trade name Temik, chiefly is used on potatoes in the Northeast and Midwest, and on Florida citrus, Texas grapefruit and 12 other crops. It is made by a division of Rhone-Poulenc Inc. of Monmouth Junction, N.J., a unit of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France.    Instead of blanket nationwide rules, the proposal incorporates a new EPA strategy that leaves much of the regulation to states. Because the potential for groundwater contamination varies geographically, the plan calls for states to impose the toughest restrictions in areas with the worst contamination or most vulnerable ground water.    However, one nationwide proposal by the EPA would prohibit use of aldicarb within 300 feet of drinking-water wells.    The EPA hails the approach as a new way to manage pesticides that are found to threaten drinking-water supplies. The agency plans to use aldicarb as a test case for devising a procedure to regulate other pesticides that seep from fields into ground water.    The proposal provides few details on standards and leaves open the question of who should be responsible for cleaning up contaminated wells. The EPA will accept public comment for 90 days and hopes to issue a final rule within a year.    While there are no known long-term effects from aldicarb, short-term exposure can inhibit nerve impulses and cause stomach aches, nausea, dizziness, disorientation and possibly death. In ground water, aldicarb poses the greatest risk to infants, even at levels currently approved by the EPA. Residues can persist in ground water for several years.    Because of ground-water problems, the pesticide already is banned in Suffolk County, N.Y., and Del Norte County, Calif., and there is a moratorium on its use on Wisconsin potatoes. The EPA is studying the risks of eating foods that contain aldicarb residues.    &quot;By and large, we're in agreement with the proposal relative to ground-water protection,&quot; said Steven Schmotzer, a spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc. He said the company has been working with states, monitoring wells and putting its own restrictions on the label since aldicarb was first found in ground water almost 10 years ago.    The EPA has found 19 different pesticides contaminating wells in 23 states. It hasn't identified the next pesticide it will regulate for ground-water contamination. </TEXT></DOC>
