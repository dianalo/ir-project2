Because if yourmonitor is displaying colors differently than they will print or separate,the careful color adjustments you made will result in final artwork of thewrong color or with an undesirable off-color cast.andP;  With a properlycalibrated monitor you get a better idea of what the color will actually looklike when printed.andM;Color proofing is still a necessary step in the color printing process,however.andP;  Proofing from separation negatives is the only way to catchproblems in those negatives before the job goes to press.andP;  And it's the onlyway to accurately test and proof colors that are out-of-gamut.andP;  (Technologylimits monitors to displaying only a subset of the colors that can beperceived by the human eye, and these displayable colors are called the gamutof the monitor.)andM;How it works.andP;  The PrecisionColor Calibrator requires a Macintosh IIconfigured with a display with at least eight bits of color or gray scale.andO;Display systems supported are:andM;andgt;The Radius Color Display with any of the Radius color graphics cards.andM;andgt;The Radius Two Page Display with the GS/C gray-scale graphics card.andM;andgt;The 13-inch Apple color monitor with either Apple's eight-bit color videocard or the IIci's on-board video interface.andM;Up to three monitors are supported at one time.andP;  PrecisionColor is notcompatible with certain Startup documents (INITs), including Connectix'sVirtual, but Radius intends to be compatible with Apple's implementation ofvirtual memory in System 7.0.andM;Installation of the calibrator's software and hardware is very simple.andP;  Acombination INIT/Control Panel device (cdev) is copied into the Systemfolder, and the calibrator hardware is plugged into the Apple Desktop Buschain with the keyboard and mouse.andM;The calibration procedure is also simple and only takes about five minutes.andO;Calibration is done from the Control Panel, so the monitor can be calibratedat any time from within any application.andP;  First you must be sure that themonitor is set for 256 levels, in either gray or color.andP;  You then calibrateby attaching the suction cup sensor to the monitor and following thedirections that appear on the screen.andP;  First you adjust the monitor'sbrightness and contrast, then you measure RGB or gray values, verify thosevalues and save.andP;  After calibration you can make further adjustments to gammaand color temperature.andP;  Calibration does not change any of the color data ina given image; it only affects the display of that image.andM;Monitors should be recalibrated fairly frequently for best color accuracy andconsistency.andP;  Radius recommends recalibrating a monitor at least once a week.andO;Recalibration could be required more often if you switch from color togray-scale mode or vice versa (only one set of calibration corrections isstored at a time), if you remove the video card, if the brightness orcontrast settings of the monitor are changed significantly, if you're doingvery critical color matching, or if there's a significant change in theambient lighting.andP;  (We wish that PrecisionColor would save both color andgray-scale correction data so you wouldn't have to recalibrate the monitorevery time you switch between those modes.)andM;Pantone Matching System.andP;  Applications use different color models on-screento represent printed output.andP;  Some work primarily with RGB data that willeventually be reproduced in CMYK, and others work primarily with Pantonecolors, reproduced either with Pantone inks or via CMYK.andP;  Radius is workingwith Pantone to produce a special calibration system for these applications,which include QuarkXPress, Aldus PageMaker and Aldus FreeHand.andM;First, a little background on Pantone.andP;  The Pantone Matching System wasintroduced in 1963, with about 500 colors in the system (there are now 747colors).andP;  Before Pantone, artists and printers had to rely on imprecisedescriptions of colors and hope for good matches -- one person's &quot;apple red&quot;might appear decidedly orange or maroon to someone else.andP;  Pantone establishedcolor formulas for mixing custom inks to accurately match the colors insample books and art materials -- color calibration for the art room.andM;In the world of traditional art materials, artists and printers have come torely on Pantone colors matching precisely from one material to another,within the limitations of the particular medium being used.andP;  (A particularPMS color printed on uncoated paper looks a bit different from that printedon a coated paper because of the nature of the paper and its interaction withthe ink, not because of a difference in ink color.) However, Pantone colorson the Macintosh have proven to be less reliable than those we've been usedto on the artist's desktop.andM;Pantone has provided tables of RGB and CMYK equivalents of all of the Pantonecolors to each of its licensees.andP;  However, each manufacturer has come up witha different implementation, some better than others.andP;  Hence, Pantone 185 redmay look decidedly pink in one application and rusty in another.andP;  Compoundedwith the problem that no two uncalibrated monitors will display the samecolor in exactly the same way, we have a color standard that doesn't lookvery standard on the Mac screen.andP;  Pantone is addressing this problem throughimproved quality control of their licensees' products and through thedevelopment of software.andM;Pantone and Radius are jointly developing the Pantone Color Toolkit, whichwill be provided to all of Pantone's licensees for incorporation in futurereleases of their software.andP;  This code will standardize how Pantone color isdisplayed on the monitor and specified for printing, so the standard willonce again be a standard.andM;As an interim solution, Radius is shipping Precision Pantone Color softwarethat works with XPress 2.12 to improve rendering of Pantone colors on screen.andO;Precision Pantone Color must be used with the Radius calibrator, but thePantone Color Toolkit will work independently of monitor calibration althoughmonitor calibration may still improve the simulation of the final viewinglight.andM;Does it work and who needs it?andP;  Monitor calibration is certainly not the onlyfactor that affects color accuracy on screen; ambient light and colorreflections from walls and clothing also will affect colors being viewed.andO;PrecisionColor does a good job of correcting display idiosyncrasies such asnon-linear gamma; it's the artist's job to calibrate the rest of the workenvironment.andP;  One illustrator reported that working with Photoshop without acalibrated monitor had caused his color proofs, printed from four-color filmseparations, to come back with a lavender cast.andP;  When he calibrated hismonitor and corrected the colors in the illustration again to adjust for thechanges caused by calibration, his proofs came back with correct colors.andM;Those who work with remote Macintoshes will benefit from the fact that thecolor viewed on their equipment will match the color on the remote machine.andO;Undoubtedly the most important application for calibration right now is incolor painting and photo-retouching software, whose final output will befull-color images printed either directly via film or proofing material, orvia four-color film separations.andM;For this type of work, color accuracy and consistency are critical.andP;  Some ofthese applications have monitor-calibration capabilities built-in, butwithout being able to measure the exact gamma value and white point of aparticular monitor as you can with PrecisionColor, the process is somewhatflawed.andP;  Color proofs are too expensive to waste on wild guesses.andM;Radius Inc. is located at 1710 Fortune Drive, San Jose, Calif.andP;  95131; (408)434-1010.andM;Mary Westland is a graphic artist, trainer and writer working inSouthborough, Mass.andM;Calibration is a critical issue that applies to the monitor, your outputdevice and their interaction.andP;  Not only must you be able to trust that thered you worked with yesterday will look the same today, but to do effectivecolor correction and retouching, you need to be able to work with a colorsimulation that is as close as possible to your final output.andP;  With hardwarecalibration you can adjust the monitor to reflect different viewingenvironments, such as standard daylight (5,000oKelvin) for printed pieces,6,500oK for video output or 9,300oK for computer presentations.andM;For large-quantity reproduction of full-color artwork you'll need four-colorfilm separations in preparation for printing on paper.andP;  As with your monitor,calibration of your output device is critical.andP;  There are also a number ofcorrections that can be made to the separation films to compensate for thetype of paper and ink being used, as well as the printing process being used.andM;Two common techniques are under-color removal (UCR) and gray-componentreplacement (GCR).andP;  These corrections remove equal parts of the threesubtractive primaries (cyan, magenta and yellow) from areas where theyoverprint and replace them with black.andP;  UCR is usually done in neutral grayareas and GCR is done in all color areas, although sometimes only thelightest of the three colors may be replaced.andP;  Both techniques reduce inkcosts, and GCR also results in better color consistency.andM;Density and contrast should be adjusted to match that of the paper andprinting process to be used.andP;  Scanned photos are likely to have wide densityranges, with very bright highlights and deep shadows.andP;  But as the brightnessand smoothness of the paper decreases, so does the possible density range forprinting; printed photos look flatter and have less contrast than when viewedon screen.andP;  By adjusting for the difference in density ranges, you can avoidlosing detail in the highlights and shadows.andM;Tone compression is another result of the loss in density range from theelectronic original to the printed piece; objects of obviously differentcolors may end up looking too much alike.andP;  For instance, apples, beets,carrots and tomatoes all have distinctly different colors, but because oftone compression in the reproduction process, they can end up looking thesame if this phenomenon is not anticipated and corrected.andM;Some of these corrections may be handled automatically by yourcolor-separation software, some may have to be invoked by the user and somemay not be available at all.andM;The bottom line is: If you're going to be creating four-color-separation artfrom your Macintosh, you'll need to work closely with your printer to be sureyou're providing properly exposed film.andP;  Especially if you're new to thistype of work, you'll want to work very closely with an output service bureauthat's already experienced in doing four-color work, rather than a shop thatspecializes in type and line art.andP;  As one service bureau owner has put it,&quot;Sure you can get into color cheap, but working in four color is stillexpensive.&quot; -- By Mary Jane Westland</TEXT></DOC>
