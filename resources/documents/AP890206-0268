(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Employees of two companies battling hostiletakeover bids from out-of-state pursuers have banded together and onMonday appealed to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis for help, but he toldthem his options are restricted.   The governor said an important reason he could not make astronger commitment to Prime Computer Inc. and Polaroid Corp., twoimportant Massachusetts employers, was that both companies areincorporated in Delaware, though they have their headquarters inMassachusetts. Nevertheless, he said, they deserve Massachusetts'protection.   ``What a state can do is limited legally,'' Dukakis told 2,500employees of Prime at its headquarters.   Both Polaroid and Prime face hostile corporate takeovers launchedby smaller firms seeking to borrow hundreds of millions to financethe transactions.   Last week a group called PACT, People Against CorporateTakeovers, was formed by employees of Prime and Polaroid. Members ofthe group said Monday they are trying to expand to other companiesthat are facing takeover battles.   Dukakis drew thunderous applause from the crowd in what soundedlike one of his presidential campaign speeches.   ``I'm a free enterpriser, I'm an entrepreneur,'' Dukakis said.``But there also have to be some reasonable rules of the game.''   ``How can you spend your time thinking about what you're going todo for your company when you're not even sure whether the company isgoing to exist in a couple of years?'' Dukakis said.   The governor said he plans to go to Washington Wednesday and willlobby for federal legislation that would change tax laws thatencourage debt-financed takeovers, sometimes called leveragedbuyouts.   ``As the phenomenon of hostile, highly leveraged corporatetakeovers continues, subsidized by the federal tax laws, ourinternational competitors must be laughing all the way to thebank,'' Dukakis said.   As Dukakis spoke in the packed atrium of Prime's suburbanheadquarters, with hundreds of other employees watching onclosed-circuit television, Polaroid officials were in U.S. DistrictCourt in Boston seeking to block the takeover of their company.   Attorneys for the instant photography giant sought an injunctionagainst Shamrock Holdings Inc. arguing that the pursuer has beenmaking false statements about Polaroid's current ecponomic strength.   Prime, meanwhile, is a week away from yet another deadline set byMAI Basic Four Inc. for its $970 million, $20-per-share takeoveroffer to buy Prime, a much larger company. Prime is scheduled to bein federal court in Boston Tuesday to argue its case that MAI isseeking to borrow too much _ $1.5 billion, according to Prime _ inits buyout bid.   Monday's meeting and speech came a day after a specialMassachusetts commission on corporate takeovers issued preliminaryrecommendations on how the state can curb the practice. Two of therecommendations involved increased lobbying efforts in Washington.   Other proposals included forcing corporate takeover strategiststo provide laid-off employees with substantial benefits and pensionprograms.   William Benjamin, one of the Prime employees in the audience,called it ``very encouraging,'' for Dukakis to visit, ``regardlessof whether there's any weight behind it.''   Prime employs 5,000 people in Massachusetts. Polaroid employsabout 8,000, company spokesmen said.   Daniel Jones, representing Prime employees, said a takeover byMAI would hurt the company's ability to compete overseas. Prime isthe leading seller of computer aided design-computer aidedmanufacture systems in Europe and second worldwide, according tocompany spokesman Richard Eckel.   Nick Pasquarosa, representing Polaroid employees, said the stakescould not be higher since both companies are in danger of beingabsorbed through takeovers and disappearing in their current form.</TEXT></DOC>
