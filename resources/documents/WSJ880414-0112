Although there isn't any evidence the Iranians planned the April 5 hijacking of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet, U.S., Kuwaiti and Israeli intelligence officials all believe the hijackers have close ties to Iran's terror network.    After being diverted to Iran, then Cyprus, where two passengers were killed, the plane remained on the ground in Algiers as of last night.    U.S. officials also believe Iran was behind a bomb attack last weekend on a Saudi Arabian Airlines office in Karachi, Pakistan, apparently in retaliation for restrictions Saudi Arabia is imposing on Iranian pilgrims to Mecca this year.    American officials have concluded that the Kuwaiti hijacking is the work of a Lebanese Shiite terrorist named Imad Mugniyah who has been trying for more than four years to free his wife's brother from prison in Kuwait, where he was convicted in 1984 of building a bomb used to attack the U.S. Embassy.    Working closely with the former Iranian ambassador to Syria, Mohammed Mohtashami-pur, who now is Iran's interior minister, and with the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Mugniyah also is believed to have directed the 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847 and the kidnapping of some 18 U.S. and French hostages in Lebanon.    Some Israeli officials believe Mr. Mugniyah recently has spent time in Iran, and some U.S. and Kuwaiti officials believe he boarded the hijacked Kuwaiti Boeing 747 at its first stop in Mashhad, Iran, after it was hijacked on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait. But U.S. intelligence analysts don't think Mr. Mugniyah is still aboard the plane.    Passengers released from the plane in Cyprus said one of the hijackers boarded the aircraft after it landed in Iran and that the gunmen got a new supply of weapons there, the Associated Press reported.    A U.S. intelligence assessment last year concluded that Iran continues to exercise substantial influence over Mr. Mugniyah and other members of the Shiite fundamentalist group Hezbollah (the Party of God), which American analysts believe is financed largely by the Iranians. American and Kuwaiti officials dismiss Iran's claims that it offered to storm the hijacked jet while it was on the ground at Mashhad.    Among other things, they note, the Iranians have never kept their promise to try the Shiite terrorists who hijacked another Kuwaiti jetliner to Tehran in December 1984 and murdered two Americans in still another attempt to free Mr. Mugniyah's brother-in-law and 16 other convicted terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait.    American analysts say it isn't clear why the Iranians and their Lebanese allies have resumed their terror campaign after the yearlong lull. But some of them say the Iranians apparently have concluded that they aren't likely to receive any more American weapons in exchange for the hostages in Lebanon, or to free their 17 colleagues in Kuwait without putting more pressure on the Kuwaiti government.    Although three members of the Kuwaiti royal family were aboard the most recently hijacked plane, U.S. analysts don't expect the Kuwaitis to yield to terrorist pressure now, after four years of standing firm. </TEXT></DOC>
