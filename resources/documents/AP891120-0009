ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If all goes according to plan _ and there'severy likelihood that it won't _ a space shuttle will leave itsFlorida launch pad in March 1995 carrying the first pieces ofAmerica's space station into orbit.   Ten flights and 28 months later, by the same shaky timetable,the parts flown up piece by piece will have been assembled into aplace where men and women can live and work for months at a time,looking down at the Earth as they silently drift across the sky 250miles high.   By August 1999, seven years late but just in time for the 21stCentury, the space station will be finished, serving as a basicresearch laboratory for medicine, astronomy, space physics, and asa staging area for manned flights to the moon and beyond.   Mostly what stands in the way of this rosy scenario is money.   Space Station Freedom, as it is named, began as an $8 billion,10-year project when President Reagan announced it in 1984. It hasgrown into a 15-year marathon likely to cost $19 billion or wellover $30 billion, depending on whose figures you use.   From the start, the space station has had problems with money aswell as with identity and purpose. Former Sen. William Proxmire ofWisconsin summed up the feelings of many in Congress when he calledthe space station ``a project in search of a mission.''   NASA administrator Richard Truly, a former astronaut, considersthe space station ``the cornerstone to our future in space,'' butadmits the program has had a sputtering past.   ``In the last five years, Space Station Freedom has undergone 11major reviews, has faced nearly continual readjustments of itsbudget, has had a great deal of management turnover and hasexperienced several configuration and schedule changes,'' he says.   The management turnover reached its peak in May and June of thisyear when three top space station executives left NASA.   The budgeting process for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _the year in which the design phase ends and cutting of metal begins_ illustrates the station's travails.   President Bush proposed that NASA get $2.05 billion for thespace station, but the House Appropriations Committee in Julydecided to chop off $400 million. With that prospect, the spaceagency made plans for a 20 percent reduction only to readjust whenactual appropriations ended as $1.85 billion.   ``The thing that's really tough is the funding instability inthe program,'' says William T. Lenoir, the NASA associateadministrator and former astronaut who reversed a trend andreturned to the agency from private life this year to take chargeof the space flight and space station programs.   ``In June of every year we don't know what the hell we are goingto get in October,'' he says. ``This year, beginning in June, weslowed the progress of the space station down because if we hadcontinued to build on schedule there was a real danger that we'dget to October and be firing contractors and laying off civilservice (employees).''   The House Committee on Science and Technology authorizedthree-year funding for NASA to give space programs some stability.However, congressional appropriations committees who vote theactual money have not gone along.   So NASA has to live with the uncertainty.   ``We are very much prejudiced to starting to construct the spacestation in March 1995,'' Lenoir says. The choices then boil down,he says, to ``can we start either less of a station in March 1995,or can we start in 1995 and let it take longer (to complete)? Andlast on our list is, `Okay, we can't start in 1995.''   The station is America's big project for the next decade. EvenPresident Bush's space goal for returning Americans to the moon andthen pushing on to Mars requires that a space station be in placefirst.   When Reagan, in his 1984 State of the Union message, directedNASA to build the station within a decade, there were giddy plansfor having it up and running in 1992 to celebrate the 500-yearanniversary of Columbus' discovery of America.   To cut down on the spiraling cost, NASA a few years ago dividedthe station building program into two phases, intending to finishone before starting the other. Now nobody talks about the secondblock.   The latest plan envisions limiting crew size to four until thestation is able to support a permanent crew of eight, planned forJuly 1997. There will be only 37.5 kilowatts of power availableuntil that time, when it will be doubled. The smaller the amount ofpower, the fewer the experiments that can be run.   NASA had planned to develop a new high-pressure space suit at acost of some $200 million. Instead, the existing shuttle space suitwill be used for the space walks that will be required to assemblethe station. NASA says it wants to reduce the need for space walksanyway.   One plan under consideration to save both money and time is todevelop a so-called ``Shuttle-C'' that would substitute a cargocontainer for the shuttle orbiter and provide more than double thecargo-carrying capacity. Such a method could cut out up to seven ofthe 16 shuttle trips now planned to bring station parts into orbit.   What will the station look like? In the present configurationthere would be a truss 508.5 feet long, constructed from long tubesmade of a composite material with a protective coating and joinedlike a child's Tinker Toy set.   Two U.S. modules _ the laboratory and the living quarters _would be attached to the truss. Each is 14.5 feet wide and 44 feetlong. The Japanese and European modules are of similar size.   On each end of the truss would be attached two huge photovoltaicarrays, looking like giant windmill paddles, to gather power fromthe sun. Two smaller structures would radiate heat out of themodules. Another structure will be a telerobotic servicer, asophisticated crane capable of performing precise manipulations inspace.   The habitation module, divided into a quiet zone, a buffer zoneand an active zone, is where the crew meets, eats, sleeps,exercises, has recreation and receives medical attention if needed.   Truly says that without the space station, ``the future we dreamof will never become the present we experience.''   The working quarters of the space station will be five times thesize of its Soviet counterpart, Mir. It will produce 10 times asmuch electrical power as skylab, allowing experiments never beforepossible.   ``An evolved space station,'' he says, ``is the first essentialstep toward moving again beyond Earth orbit into the solarsystem.'' And from that will spring the return to the moon andjourney to Mars.   ``Each time we go to the frontier and beyond,'' says Truly, ``webring back more than we hoped for. This time we have the chance tobring back more than we can imagine.''</TEXT></DOC>
