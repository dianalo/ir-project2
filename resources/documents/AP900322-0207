The advertising campaign, centered on the slogan ``There's aWorld of Shopping in New York,'' is part of a broader promotion ofthe positive aspects of New York's businesses. Variations on the``There's a World of ...'' theme, eventually will be adapted forrestaurants, theatre, health care, banking and other industries.   Retail was chosen as the subject to kick off the feel-goodcampaign in part because city government officials and businessleaders felt it was time to highlight the pluses because theminuses had been getting a lot of attention.   Don Klein, chairman and creative director of the MacNamara Clappandamp; Klein Inc. ad agency, which is developing the campaign, saidWednesday the retail promotion has a two-pronged mission.   It is aimed at attracting customers to the shoppingopportunities in the city and attracting retailers to openbusinesses here.   He said the ads aren't meant to refute the widely publizedproblems that have been plaguing numerous retailers.   ``We're not going to be talking about the negative. Thoseproblems have been disproportionately blown up,'' he said in aninterview.``This is simply to remind people of the vastness and thediversity that is New York City.''   The plight of several prominent U.S. retailers grabbed headlinesover the Christmas season.   As the peak shopping season started, B. Altman andamp; Co., avenerable old retailer, went into liquidation. Department storesowned by the debt encumbered Campeau Corp., includingBloomingdale's, slashed prices to boost sales and raise cash,forcing their more financially sound competitors to follow suit.   New York, always known for stiff competition in retailing, wasthe scene of some of the fiercest battling for market share in thecountry over the holidays.   A preview of the new retail promotion was given at a breakfastmeeting hosted by the Association for a Better New York, the FifthAvenue Association and the Mayor's Office for Economic Development.   Retailers who recently have opened stores in New York or plan toin the near future spoke optimistically about doing business in thecity.   Among them were Marashu Isogai, executive vice president andgeneral manager of JUSCO, the Japanese holding company of theTalbots Inc. women's clothing chain, and Ermenegildo Zegna,executive vice president of an Italian menswear manufacturer andretailer.   Lewis Rudin, chairman of ABNY and operator of a major propertymanagement company, said at the meeting that boosting retailbusiness in New York could help alleviate some of the city's fiscalwoes by generating more tax revenue.   The city is believed to be facing possibly its worst financialcrisis ever. The new mayor, David N. Dinkins, said earlier thisweek that the city's budget deficit is much larger than the $1.1billion gap estimated in February.   Mary Holloway, executive director of ABNY, said details of thecampaign, including costs, still are being worked out and will beunveiled at a news conference probably in late April.   The campaign will be spearheaded by the association and theMayor's Office for Economic Development. Advertisements areexpected to appear in newspapers and magazines and be carried ontelevision and radio.</TEXT></DOC>
