You prepare the field, sow the seeds, tend theplants and reap 20 heads of lettuce. Then from the sky fallsa rake. There is still you, a field and some lettuce seeds,but using the rake has allowed you to double your production.   That is the free lunch provided by technology. And that iswhat Joel Mokyr has in mind in his &quot;The Lever of Riches:Technological Creativity and Economic Progress&quot; (OxfordUniversity Press, 349 pages, $24.95). Like a lever, advancesin technology raise productivity, spur economic growth andincrease wealth. This we know. What we don't know is why somesocieties are more technologically creative than others, orwhy some technologically creative societies cease to be so.This is what Mr. Mokyr explores in a densely rich, subtlyflavored buffet of theories, ideas, insights and examples.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mokyr begins by summarizing the chief technologicaladvances over the past 25 centuries -- stopping at 1914 --focusing on those that influenced living standards. It's alot of territory, but even history wussies can follow alongby looking at the illustrations and savoring the odd fact.   It's startling to be reminded that Hellenistic societyinvented the lever, wedge, screw, pulley and gear. (Sometimein the first century, Hero of Alexandria even invented acoin-operated vending machine to dispense temple holy water.)In the Middle Ages came the horse shoe and stirrup along withthe chimney, which facilitated home cooking and gifts fromSanta. Islamic society invented paper. And China gave usmatches, the umbrella and the toothbrush.   The narrative chapters, with their relentless and detailedlistings, begin to throw up questions. Why, for example, asksMr. Mokyr, &quot;did classical society with its indisputableintellectual superiority, achieve so little by way oftechnological innovation compared to the crude and illiteratepeasants of medieval Europe?&quot; Why did creativity fade inIslam in 1200, China in 1450, Japan in 1600? Why didn'tEurope wilt in 1750 -- why, indeed, did the IndustrialRevolution start in 1750? And why, then, did Britain losearound 1900?   Mr. Mokyr addresses these questions by considering 16possible factors in generating technological progress. He --more or less -- rejects some explanations: that increasinglife expectancy allowed more time and incentive to generatenew knowledge; that the availability or scarcity of resourcesdetermined technological solutions; that high labor costs ledto laborsaving inventions; that population pressures signify.He -- more or less -- finds some power in other explanations:the spillover effects from previous technologies; and, morerecently, the supply of scientific ideas and demands of war.   And he -- more or less -- accepts other explanations: Goodnutrition, property rights, openness to new information,willingness to bear risks and a tolerant political structureall matter. Mr. Mokyr also gives the nod to the importance ofreligion -- does it promote a frame of mind to challengenature?   I use the words &quot;more or less&quot; because Mr. Mokyr isjudicious. After going through the trouble of laying out sucha feast, he has no intention of becoming an overbearingmaitre d'hotel. But the best chapter is on China and Europe,in which Mr. Mokyr deals with what has been called thegreatest enigma in the history of technology -- the failureof China to sustain its technological supremacy.   Before 1400, the Chinese were on a technological roll,even within reach of an industrial revolution, before lapsinginto backwardness. His explanation centers on the role of thestate. In China, invention and innovation were provinces ofthe government, which lost interest in technological advancefor a variety of reasons. Creativity came to an end.   For Mr. Mokyr, the occurrence of technological creativityis complicated. Religion, education, willingness to bear riskand the social status of production all determine the supplyof ideas. &quot;But the environment into which these seeds aresown is, of course, the main determinant of whether they willsprout. There are no oneline explanations here, no simpletheorems. It is hard to think of conditions that would beeither necessary or sufficient for a high level oftechnological progress. At the same time, a favorableenvironment may itself be insufficient if new technologicalideas fail to arise.&quot;   A pity that Mr. Mokyr's analysis stops at 1914. But hedoes provide some thoughts on what could come. He argues thatnothing guarantees technological advance. Progress cannot betaken for granted. Among its enemies, he lists forces that&quot;tried to preserve the status quo: environmental lobbies,labor unions, clayfooted giant corporations, professionalassociations, reactionary or incompetent bureaucracies.&quot;   But Mr. Mokyr sees no signs of technological exhaustion inthe global economy. Indeed, he finds no evidence thatcreativity naturally falls victim to diminishing returns,fatigue or old age. As long as some part of the world economyadvances, the rest will not fall into a stagnant state thatcould deck economic growth -- in other words, your free lunchis mine as well.   ---   Ms. Lee is an economist.</TEXT></DOC>
