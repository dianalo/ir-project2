More specifically, the relevance of a progressiverate structure is considered in relation to household electricity consumption.Such a rate structure is characterized by the fact that the price perunit increases as the yearly household consumption increases. Four ratestructures are examined: a proportional rate structure with a constantfixed charge; a progressive step tariff with a constant fixed chargefor every consumption block; a progressive step tariff with degressivefixed charges; and a progressive block tariff with a constant fixed charge.Analysis of the effects of these kinds of structures on electricity consumptionis made in accordance with tariffs prevailing in the Netherlands in 1978,and use was made of other Dutch studies involving household interviewsand econometrics. A number of hypotheses on price elasticity were consideredand empirical research was done only on the progressive block tariff.It was concluded that a progressive rate structure always leads to adecrease of consumption in comparison with the current proportional tariffs.This decrease varies from 1-6% and appears to increase as the differencein prices between the consumption blocks increase and as the number oftariff blocks increases. The effects of a progressive tariff on energysavings will be considerably greater if the fixed charge, or parts thereof,is included in the kWh prices. 18 refs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
