So how has the new MetLife-State Street Government Income Fund managed to attract $2.6 billion this month?    First, the new fund picked a sector where recent industry growth has been concentrated: government bond funds. Next, the Boston-based fund used a popular new sales structure that -- on the surface, at least -- looks good for investors, brokers and the fund manager. &quot;We decided one of the key factors (to a fund's success) is pricing,&quot; explains David McLean, president of the fund.    The new fund is no-load, that is, without a sales charge. Yet it's being sold through brokers and financial planners, who usually deal only in load funds. They've been attracted by the latest wrinkle in mutual fund pricing, getting their sales commissions from borrowed, or advanced money. The commission money is paid back from investor assets over time, further clouding the already-murky distinction between load and no-load funds.    In this case, the money comes from the deep pockets of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. The insurance company expects to recoup the cost over several years from the so-called 12b-1 fees that are deducted annually from the fund's assets.    What's more, brokers are getting an incentive commission of 2% that drops to 1% after the initial offering period ends either when the fund reaches $3.5 billion or 90 days from start-up.    &quot;The brilliance of it is that it helped take the broker off the hook for (previously) selling a long bond product,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. Mr. Lipper figures that rising interest rates give brokers &quot;a natural reason&quot; to ring up clients, tell them there's some concern in the markets and if the investor is really nervous, suggest moving out of the current fund into the new one, at no cost.    Of course, the new fund is intended to be long-term, too. But at the moment it's invested in short-term instruments while it shops around in the market for its ideal 50-50 mix of long-term Treasury issues and Ginnie Maes. So, Mr. Lipper figures, its investors may be buying some time in what is essentially a short-term fund before having to decide what they really think of long-term bond prospects.    And the investor who switches funds only to go hunting again might have done better to stay put in the first place, particularly if a market is bottoming out.    Mr. McLean holds that most of the money that the MetLife-State Street fund is raising comes from &quot;new sources,&quot; primarily bank certificates of deposit. &quot;We advertised we didn't want 'swap' money&quot; from other mutual funds, he says. Still, he acknowledges that &quot;a number of the funds we talked to were concerned we'd be seen that way.&quot;    Chuck Johnson, vice president of marketing at Franklin Resources Inc., says: &quot;When you have a big underwriting with a lot of appeal like that, it tends to cannibalize some business from the current distribution channels.&quot; San Mateo, Calif.-based Franklin Resources manages $34 billion, primarily in bond funds.    Wherever the money is coming from, Mr. McLean says it's still coming. He says the fund has been drawing an average of $35 million a day in the last couple of weeks. Most new funds raised only around $46 million during their entire first year, according to a Lipper study done last year.    The fund's prospectus targets its yield at about 8%. But that's only part of the more encompassing total return, which combines interest rate income and price changes of the bonds in the portfolio. The fund's net asset value is off about 3% since it began March 23 -- just days before interest rates started to rise and bond prices began to fall.    At the end of last week, the fund was running about 10% in cash with the balance of the portfolio invested in short-term securities -- both of which help hedge against declining bond prices. Mr. McLean figures the fund is performing about the same as a three-year Treasury issue.    For those who would criticize the new government income venture for taking away assets from other funds during a period of declining bond prices, Mr. McLean says: &quot;There's two sides to everything. And with a new fund around, there's a natural buyer in the market.&quot;    He says the fund was in the market late last week, doing some bargain-basement shopping for securities that meet the goals laid out in its prospectus. </TEXT></DOC>
