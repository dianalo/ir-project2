(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PC-based facsimile systems are trying to ride the crest of the faxing wave.andO;The market potential is great, so the waters have attracted a flotilla ofproducts, with prices ranging from well under $500 to more than $1,000.andM;PC-based fax systems let users send and receive faxes directly through theirPCs.andM;Although the high-ticket PC fax systems have received most of the market'sattention thus far, PC Week took a look at the opposite end of the pricespectrum -- PC fax systems costing less than $500.andM;Five of the six products reviewed here are internal fax boards that areinstalled in an available PC slot; Everex Systems Inc.'s EF 12/48 modem is anexternal PC-based fax system that plugs into a PC's serial port.andM;The following internal boards were evaluated: American Data Technology Inc.'sSmartFax, Brooktrout Technology Inc.'s Fax-Mail 96, The Complete PC Inc.'sThe Complete Fax, GammaLink's GammaFax and Hayes Microcomputer ProductsInc.'s JT Fax (formerly owned by Quadram Corp.).andM;Each PC board was installed in an 8MHz AT-class system attached to aToken-Ring network running Novell Inc.'s NetWare.andP;  Everex's external faxsystem was connected via RS-232 cabling to the AT's serial port.andP;  Whenpossible, faxes were printed across the network.andP;  To test receiving, areduced page of PC Week was sent to each AT from a stand-alone Ricoh faxmachine, then each board was called on to send a four-page ASCII text filefrom the machine to the Ricoh.andP;  Fax-transmission scheduling and distributionlists were tested by sending the text file between the PC fax cards.andM;In transmission tests, each of the fax systems showed nearly equalperformance.andP;  All six products also support Group III facsimile protocol,thus ensuring compatibility among the systems.andM;While the feature sets and the operation of the six products differ greatly,any of them will deliver fax capability at a bargain-basement price.andM;----------Not the SmartestandM;AMERICAN DATA TECHNOLOGY INC.,andM;SMARTFAX, $299, $499andM;SmartFax, available in 9,600-bps ($499) and 4,800-bps ($299) models, does notpass with straight As.andM;One major design problem is the product's use of a disk spooler to storeincoming faxes.andP;  The SmartFax software requires users to designate as many as4M bytes of hard-disk space in 512K-byte increments for the spooler.andM;Installers must dedicate enough hard-disk capacity for incoming faxes;otherwise, when the spooler is full, the software will write over existingdocuments to make room for new ones.andM;Another problem is that all received files are stored in the spooler as faximages.andP;  Users must convert files to DOS files, then display them using theSmartFax software -- a time-consuming step not required in the other faxsystems tested.andM;SmartFax's graphics editor permits the user to preview and edit images priorto transmission, and allows a letterhead or signature to be inserted into afax.andP;  Also, a mail-merge option enables names and addresses to be importedquickly from an ASCII file into a fax transmission.andP;  Though SmartFax does notsupport Video Graphics Array (VGA) adapters, it does provide 300-dot-per-inchresolution for printing.andM;Contact American Data Technology in Pasadena, Calif., at (818) 578-1339.andM;Buyers say: Faxing isn't trouble-freeandM;For some buyers, transmitting documents via SmartFax has been far fromtrouble-free.andP;  &quot;We can send faxes, but we consistently can't receive them,&quot;said Simon Heitmeyer, president of Computer Management Assistance Co., avalue-added reseller of minicomputers in Mount Vernon, Ill.andM;Incoming faxes that are longer than a page don't transmit properly, heexplained.andP;  This may be the result of compatibility problems with other faxmachines, he said, adding that senders must fax one page at a time to receivea clear transmission.andP;  &quot;At this point, we don't feel comfortable with itsreliability.&quot;andM;SmartFax, however, proved to be the best product for Don Wirkkala, aconsultant for Telefax Systems, an international trade company in San Diego.andO;&quot;I was looking for a product that had a lot of bells and whistles,&quot; hereported.andP;  Wirkkala was impressed with SmartFax's graphics capabilities,automatic mail-merge, and worldwide area-code and time-zone directory.andM;A Speedy Fax TransmitterandM;BROOKTROUT TECHNOLOGY INC.,andM;FAX-MAIL, $499andM;With a transmission speed of 9,600 bps and a complete user interface,Fax-Mail is a good alternative to more expensive products, although it hassome glitches.andM;Fax-Mail sent a four-page file to the Ricoh fax machine in 75 seconds -- atask that takes about twice as long on a 4,800-bps fax system.andM;Fax-Mail also offers the most informative user interface of the productsreviewed.andP;  Everything is organized succinctly via windows, which list thefaxes sent, received and scheduled for delivery.andM;FaxMail includes a text editor but no graphics editor.andP;  Like many fax boards,such as The Complete Fax and JT Fax, Fax-Mail provides a printer-capturefeature that takes input from any application intended for an Epson printerand converts it into a Group III fax.andM;Unfortunately, Fax-Mail does not support dialing directories of frequentlycalled phone numbers -- a feature found in all the other packages tested.andO;Rather than displaying a list of numbers from inside the program, Fax-Mailrequires users to set up &quot;phone files&quot; -- ASCII files with .PHN extensions.andM;For users of utilities such as Borland International Inc.'s SideKick who wantto transfer their existing telephone directories over to a fax system withoutrekeying, this approach will be advantageous.andP;  But for others, it's atime-consuming bother that could be avoided by modifying the software toprovide phone lists from within the application.andM;The software's display of incoming faxes also needs improvement.andP;  Althoughthe display is clear, it is complicated by Fax-Mail's horizontal and verticalscaling.andP;  Scaling gives users the power to manipulate an image and zoom in onimportant details, but it takes time getting used to.andM;Nevertheless, for speedy and easy fax transmissions, Fax-Mail is well worthconsidering.andP;  Contact Brooktrout in Wellesley Hills, Mass., at (617)235-3026.andM;Buyers say: Needs graphics boostandM;At Market-Fax Inc., Brooktrout's Fax-Mail board is more than just an addedperipheral: &quot;It's the key to our company,&quot; said Allen Phillips, president ofthe Brighton, Mass., company, which provides targeted fax advertising.andM;Key for Phillips is the ability to transfer an ASCII file of phone numbersfrom his Paradox database into FaxMail 96.andM;Some buyers, however, believe Fax-Mail's graphics capabilities could improve.andO;&quot;I wish it had a graphics [editor] built into the software,&quot; said EarlArbuckle, assistant chief engineer for WPIX Inc., a television and radiobroadcasting company in New York.andM;&quot;The board can only handle Epson-type fonts, and that's not good enough whenyou want to do desktop publishing-type documents,&quot; added Alan Sigueira,senior research economist for Data Resources Standard Import's Corp., aresearch and consulting company in Lexington, Mass.andM;Fax on a BudgetandM;THE COMPLETE PC INC.,andM;THE COMPLETE FAX, $399andM;The Complete Fax doesn't quite live up to its name, but with a list price ofonly $399, it stands tall among its low-cost PC fax brethren.andP;  It convertsEpson print files to Group III facsimile protocol while transmitting a fax,and it receives and transmits faxes in background, thanks to its on-boardcoprocessor.andM;On the down side, it has no Hayes-compatible modem option (although its $6999,600-bps sibling does).andP;  Also, the software did not work on the IBMToken-Ring Network used for testing: It routinely hung the PC and required acold reboot.andP;  The manufacturer could only recommend not loading the networkdrivers -- a solution that solved the immediate problem of a hanging PC, butoffered nothing for output to the network printer.andM;The Complete Fax has two program modules that run together.andP;  CFBACK, thesoftware's terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) portion, allows the fax board tosend and receive faxes in background.andP;  CFAX provides the phone book,directory and status screens.andM;The Complete Fax's pop-up window has one significant weakness: an inabilityto access the phone directory from the window.andP;  Users must type theinformation each time a transmission is made from the TSR program.andM;If it could just be enhanced by a more stable TSR program that has access tothe phone directory and 9,600-bps output, the The Complete Fax would live upto its  name.andM;Contact The Complete PC Inc. in Milpitas, Calif., at (408) 434-0145.andM;Buyers say: Great background featureandM;William Ayers, a free-lance writer with Sierra Softball Publications in Reno,Nev., needed an easy-to-use, inexpensive fax board that would send andreceive faxes in background.andP;  The Complete Fax fit the bill.andM;Technical support has been Ayers' only frustration.andP;  &quot;[The Complete PC]proved to be very difficult to get hold of,&quot; he said.andM;Some buyers have experienced more problems than just technical-supportdifficulties.andP;  &quot;I was a Complete PC user until reliability became a problem,&quot;said Gary Strom, president of Cardinal Point Steamship Agency in Houston,which represents steamship lines.andM;An External Fax AlternativeandM;EVEREX SYSTEMS INC., EF 12/48, $499andM;The external EF 12/48 has several endearing qualities.andP;  Most outstanding isthat it is both a fax and a general-purpose 1,200-bps modem compatible withthe Hayes command set.andP;  It comes with Everex's BitCom 3 communicationssoftware for general communications, as well as EFax 2.0 fax software.andM;The EFax software has a good interface, making extensive use of functionkeys, with labels across the bottom of the screen displaying the keys' use ineach screen.andM;However, EFax's companion TSR, KeyFax, is limited.andP;  KeyFax enables the PC towait for incoming faxes and initiates sending faxes that were previouslyscheduled by EFax.andP;  The problem is that when a fax is actually being sent orreceived, KeyFax takes control of the computer and stops all other programsuntil the transmission finishes.andM;KeyFax also requires more than 100K bytes of RAM.andP;  Although JT Fax requireseven more -- 169K bytes -- its high memory demand is justified because itgives users complete access to all of its features.andM;Given the limited functionality of KeyFax, the RAM overhead is excessive.andM;The EF 12/48 wins points for combining a 1,200-bps Hayes-compatible modemwith its low price.andM;The main program, EFax, is easy to work with, but the KeyFax TSR program isthe most limited in this group and the most RAM hungry.andM;Everex Systems Inc., of Fremont, Calif., can be reached at (415) 498-1111.andM;Buyers say: Easy to useandM;Ease of installation and ease of use are two EFax features that impressedCynthia Campbell, president and owner of Resistence Repair, a hi-fi and VCRrepair company in Berkeley, Calif.andP;  &quot;EFax fit into my existing system soeasily,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;I can also schedule faxes without getting out of mydBASE program.&quot;andM;Ron Jeffries, an international sales manager for the Access Products Divisionof Network Equipment Technologies in Santa Barbara, Calif., found the userinterface easy.andM;&quot;The way I like to use EFax is to have it resident, and write faxes as ASCIIfiles with an editor,&quot; he said.andM;Jeffries did note one problem: &quot;The list handling in this product -- and inevery other fax board -- isn't as strong as I need it to be.&quot;andM;Hardware Strong, Software WeakandM;GAMMALINK, GAMMAFAX, $495andM;At $495, the 9,600-bps GammaFax fax modem is extremely attractive.andP;  Thehardware zips out fax transmissions and works well in background.andP;  However,when it comes to manipulating the software to send a fax or display areceived fax, GammaFax is not as easy to use as slower boards, such as JTFax.andM;GammaFax offers many sophisticated fax features, such as the ability to faxCAD/CAM images, support for PostScript files and a rich command language tointegrate fax into other applications.andP;  However, these features are onlyaccessible after some fancy footwork with the programming language.andM;The software and the manual also assume a high degree of knowledge.andP;  Whendisplaying received files, GammaFax doesn't give users an on-screen menu ofoptions to help them maneuver around the display.andM;GammaFax excels in sending files, and several files can be selected fortransmission.andP;  The automatic conversion to fax format is quick, and users canpreview a file that's scheduled for transmission.andM;With a solid hardware foundation, GammaLink should go back to the drawingboard with its software and make it easier for users to access all of theproduct's  features.andM;GammaLink, of Palo Alto, Calif., can be reached at (415) 856-7421.andM;Buyers say: Programming ability keyandM;While some buyers find GammaFax's programming capabilities hard to use,Nicholas Keenan, information-systems manager for SNL Securities Ltd. inHoboken, N.J., finds them extremely powerful.andM;The company sends about 2,000 faxes per week, Keenan said.andP;  &quot;It wasn't theease of use that impressed me as much as the ease of customization.&quot;andM;For example, Keenan has linked his database with GammaFax.andP;  Each time thedatabase is updated, the same information is automatically entered intoGammaFax's directory.andM;Barbara Chupp, manager of international publications and communications atmarket researcher Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif., also found GammaFax'sprogramming capabilities critical.andP;  She needed to expand the address field toaccommodate foreign addresses for faxes sent worldwide.andM;&quot;Most fax boards have about 25 characters per field for address information,&quot;she said.andM;With the help of a programming specialist, her GammaFax board was customized,allowing the address field to be increased.andM;SNL Securities' Keenan -- who uses the product on a Novell network -- alsolikes the board's ability to run without using the memory-resident mode.andP;  Thememory-resident mode conflicts with the network drivers, he explained, anddoesn't leave enough memory for other network applications.andM;The Straight FaxandM;HAYES MICROCOMPUTER PRODUCTS INC.,andM;JT FAX 4800, $295 (Quadram's price)andM;JT Fax, formerly owned by Quadram Corp., has long been a favorite ofreviewers and buyers of low-cost fax boards because installation is a snap,operation is a breeze, and performance is rock-solid.andM;The JT Fax software is entirely memory-resident, so its functions andeasy-to-use menus are only a hot key away in any application.andP;  Duringtesting, PC Week found that JT Fax would perform when other fax boards werenot cooperating.andP;  However, like most of the other boards reviewed, JT Fax4800 halts all other activity on the PC when it is sending or receiving afax.andM;Because JT Fax's software runs entirely in RAM, it takes up a sizable 169Kbytes of memory.andP;  The software isn't a typical TSR program: It actually runsa secondary command processor in the same way as the Lotus 1-2-3 Systemcommand, which causes some problems.andM;A secondary command processor can't pass variables back to the original DOSenvironment.andP;  For instance, changes to the path after JT Fax is loaded won'tbe recognized by applications.andP;  Running JT Fax on a Novell networkworkstation made this problem abundantly apparent.andP;  None of the search-drivemappings would work if the workstation was logged on to the network afterloading JT Fax.andP;  Logging in and then loading JT Fax, however, solved thatproblem.andP;  It is common on networks to alter the path as users move betweenapplications.andP;  JT Fax, thus, would be a constant nuisance to most networkusers.andM;If Hayes could only squeeze in a 9,600-bps modem and background processingfor under $500, JT Fax would be ideal.andP;  JT Fax will be available from QuadramCorp. through 1989.andP;  Contact Quadram of Norcross, Ga., at (800) 548-3420.andO;Hayes can be reached in Atlanta at (404) 449-8791.andM;Buyers say: Faxing made impressiveandM;&quot;It's a nifty little product for the money,&quot; said Paul Connell, a partner atKilpatrick and Cody, a law firm in Atlanta.andM;Cardinal Point Steamship Agency's Gary Strom is another avid supporter of JTFax.andP;  Most impressive, Strom said, is that &quot;JT Fax will tell you whathappened during a failure.&quot; Strom added that users can easily access JT Fax'sphone directory, simply by typing the first initial of the desired recipientof a fax.andP;  JT Fax then finds the directory that starts with that letter.andM;----------Reviews by Matt Kramer and Chet Schuyler; interviews by Martha Tracy; editedby Maureen FaustandM;Although all of the PC-based fax systems reviewed here make an attractivepurchase for users needing to fax PC documents occasionally, potential buyersshould expect some inconveniences if they choose the low-priced boards.andM;The factor that most sets this group apart from the higher-priced competitionis speed.andM;More expensive fax systems typically run at 9,600 bps.andM;With the exception of Brooktrout's Fax-Mail, GammaLink's GammaFax andAmerican Data Technology's SmartFax, all of the under-$500 fax boards testedhere support only 4,800 bps.andM;Using a 4,800-bps fax system after seeing a 9,600-bps system run is likedriving a Chevette after stepping out of a Corvette.andM;Another drawback to the under-$500 crowd is that, although they wait forincoming faxes in the background, some (such as JT Fax and EFax) don't have acoprocessor on the board and must assume total control of the PC when sendingand receiving.andM;Finally, unlike their higher-priced cousins, only a few low-cost fax systems,such as JT Fax, convert documents to Group III fax format duringtransmission.andM;Most fax systems convert the text files before sending them, which slows thefax transmission and makes the hard disk store both the original file and theconverted fax image file.andM;The low prices of the fax systems, however, may outweigh these shortcomings.andM;-- Matt Kramer and Chet Schuyler</TEXT></DOC>
