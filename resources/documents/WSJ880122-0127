Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AET RAH AHP </CO><IN> TNM BCY PHA FIN INS </IN><TEXT>   Aetna Casualty andamp; Surety Co.'s creative effort to resolve its own Dalkon Shield liability by piggybacking on the reorganization of A.H. Robins Co. could set an important precedent for insurers of companies in bankruptcy-law proceedings.    But legal experts say that Aetna's maneuver to protect itself from future liabilities might be vulnerable to legal challenge. Aetna Casualty is a unit of Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co.    Aetna Casualty, Robins's former insurer, said it has agreed to pay $100 million into a trust fund to compensate women who claim injury from the birth control device sold by Robins in the early 1970s. Aetna also has agreed to provide $250 million in insurance to pay certain claims that aren't covered by the fund.    In exchange, Aetna seeks two objectives: first, settlement of a huge, separate class-action suit brought on behalf of Shield users; and second, an order from the judge supervising Robins's bankruptcy case that women compensated by the trust fund would be barred from suing Aetna in the future.    Aetna's attorneys are confident that the proposed solution will withstand any legal attack. &quot;Our agreement helps resolve the (Robins) bankruptcy in a pragmatic way,&quot; says W. Scott Street, an Aetna attorney.    But controversy could arise from both of Aetna's goals. Women who discover injuries from the Shield in the future may claim that they weren't part of the class action and therefore couldn't have sacrificed the right to sue Aetna.    Moreover, some lawyers and legal scholars question whether bankruptcy law permits a judge to relieve of liability any party other than the debtor company that formally sought court protection from its creditors.    &quot;This is a very clever attempt&quot; by Aetna, says Martin Klein, a New York bankruptcy lawyer familiar with the Robins case. &quot;But it isn't clear that it will work or that it ought to.&quot;    Major terms of Aetna's agreement, which also involves Robins's proposed acquirer, American Home Products Corp., aren't in writing yet, and they are still subject to some debate.    For example, attorneys for plaintiffs in the class action say it isn't clear whether Aetna's $100 million payment will supplement the $2.48 billion that American Home has proposed to put into the Shield trust. Aetna and American Home have described the $100 million as part of the $2.48 billion total.    But those significant differences aside, the very concept of the agreement may provoke legal combat in coming months. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that only the debtor company itself can be released from obligations as part of its reorganization.    Precedent doesn't offer a clear answer to the Aetna dilemma. Frank Kennedy, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Law School, notes that federal appellate courts are split over the issue of whether an agreement such as Aetna's could subsequently be challenged once approved by the bankruptcy court.    Some federal judges have ruled that &quot;once such an agreement to discharge debts is confirmed, it's a binding order that can't be collaterally attacked,&quot; Prof. Kennedy says.    However, other judges have decided that the agreements aren't enforceable because a bankruptcy court lacks the authority to confirm them in the first place.    Of course, dissident attorneys for Shield claimants could challenge the Aetna agreement before the court approves it. If they do, Prof. Kennedy contends that the court &quot;should and probably will delete (Aetna's) purported discharge.&quot;    Some experts find disturbing the notion that insurers of arguably solvent companies &quot;hiding&quot; in Chapter 11 could also find a permanent refuge in that process. &quot;The troubling question is, Where do you stop?&quot; says Mr. Klein, the New York attorney.    Moreover, lawyers involved in the Robins case note that if the Aetna arrangement unravels, it could bode ill for the entire Robins reorganization. American Home has agreed to acquire Robins on the understanding that it wouldn't be subject to any Shield liability, either.    &quot;If Aetna can't be discharged,&quot; says a lawyer involved in the case, &quot;you'd have to begin to wonder about whether American Home could count on that guarantee.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
