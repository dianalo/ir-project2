The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans tolaunch two $3 billion satellites near the end of the decadeto study the changing global environment. Each of thesatellites, called Earth Observing Systems, or EOS-A andEOS-B, would be replaced at five-year intervals to get a15-year environmental record of Earth.</LP><TEXT>   Critics say the satellites are too expensive and toorisky. If an EOS satellite should fail during launch or inorbit it could wreck climate research because, the criticscontend, so many instruments are concentrated on a singlesatellite.   The National Space Council, headed by Vice President DanQuayle, has said it shares the concerns of the critics and isconsidering whether to restructure the project. The WhiteHouse turned to the National Research Council, a part of theNational Academy of Sciences, to get an appraisal of EOSbefore deciding whether to make any changes.   The research council's report supports EOS generally, butsays that a series of smaller satellites, which are scheduledfor launch before EOS, should take precedence over the largerones. Those satellites are intended to continue studies ofthe ocean and atmosphere. &quot;If budget constraints arise, itwould be more desirable to delay the launch of EOS spacecraftthan to forgo or diminish the effectiveness&quot; of the smallersatellites, the report said.   For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the Bushadministration is asking Congress for $235 million for theEOS program and $25 million for the smaller satellites.   NASA has proposed putting as many as 16 differentinstruments on each EOS-A and EOS-B. The report said NASA hasdemonstrated that its plan makes sense for EOS-A, but hasn'tyet shown a need to put all the EOS-B instruments on onesatellite. The space agency could carve EOS-B into a numberof &quot;smaller, independent satellites,&quot; the study said. EOScritics have urged such a move to simplify EOS design and toreduce the harm to the climate research program if one of thesatellites should fail.   The study also warned that the biggest technical challengeto EOS lies in building a computer system on the groundcapable of handling, storing and disseminating the vastamounts of data the satellites will relay from space. Theground-based computer system must be powerful enough tohandle a Library of Congress worth of information every monthor so.   &quot;While the importance and challenge of {the computersystem} are understood, it is not equally clear that theroute to achieving such a system and the resources andadvance planning required are fully appreciated,&quot; the reportsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
