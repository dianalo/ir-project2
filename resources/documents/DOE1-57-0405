During this period of time over 3600 acres of landhave been reclaimed. At the Poker Flats mining area reclamation is currentlytaking place closely behind the mining of coal. Over the next 10-15 yearsa total of 710 acres of land will be reclaimed. This reclamation willrequire a substantial effort to assure an end product that will be acceptableunder the current surface coal-mining laws. The steps involved in reclamationare planning, regrading, seedbed preparation, planting, and monitoring,each of which are briefly described. The ultimate test of the reclaimedland is whether it is going to be of benefit to wildlife. The resultsover the past 15 years have been very encouraging. It is heartening tosee caribou, Dall sheep, and moose grazing on previously mined areas.14 references, 9 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
