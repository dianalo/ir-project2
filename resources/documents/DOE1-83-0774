Within thesedisciplines lies experience and expertise found in no other industry.To capture and widely apply this expertise is the challenge to developingthe knowledge base expert systems. The characteristics of plausible reasoningshared by medical diagnosis and mineral exploration are common, to somedegree to many other evaluation tasks as well. Hence, the purpose ofthis paper is to illustrate, by a case study of mining equipment selection,the general process of capturing and encoding human expertise into amechanical realization. 13 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
