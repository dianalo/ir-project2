Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TEK </CO><TEXT>   Tektronix Inc. announced plans to dismiss about 1,000 employees, or 6% of its work force, in a bid to boost earnings.    As a result of the terminations, Tektronix said it expects to post &quot;significant&quot; one-time charges that may result in a loss for the fiscal third quarter ended March 5. The Beaverton, Ore.-based concern didn't disclose the size of the planned charges.    Tektronix, which makes scientific instruments and graphics terminals and workstations, said results will be released March 25. In the year-earlier period, Tektronix had profit of $18.7 million, or 48 cents a share, and sales of $415.4 million.    Almost all the dismissals involve managerial and professional workers, and won't significantly affect production, a spokeswoman said. While certain research and development projects will be halted, and the sales and marketing force will be scaled back, she said, no current products will be dropped.    The dismissals will be completed by May 28, Tektronix said.    David P. Friedley, who was named Tektronix president and chief executive officer four months ago, said the cuts follow a &quot;critical review&quot; of the company's operations. &quot;We've been operating at less-than-maximum efficiency, and our appetite for many projects and programs is greater than our pocketbook can adequately fund,&quot; he said. While orders and sales in the latest quarter are higher than the year-earlier period, he said, &quot;expenses have continued to grow faster than sales.&quot;    Peter M. Musser, an analyst at Cable Howse andamp; Ragen in Seattle, said, &quot;They're addressing the right issues&quot; at Tektronix, where operating margins have been &quot;disappointing&quot; in recent periods. Mr. Musser pointed out that it's a difficult maneuver to cut marketing services without ultimately losing potential sales, but added: &quot;I'm giving (Mr. Friedley) the benefit of the doubt. In the long run, this can be a positive.&quot;    The market seemed to concur with Mr. Musser's assessment. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Tektronix closed at $26.50, up 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
