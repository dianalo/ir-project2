(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Fuhr, Norbert.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A least squares polynomial (LSP) approach to the implementation ofoptimal (database) polynomial retrieval functions is developed.andO;Effective and efficient information retrieval methods are a majoraspect of database research.andP;  The new approach to developingretrieval functions is based on a heuristic probability rankingprinciple and consists of mapping request-document pairs ontodescription vectors, with a polynomial function giving estimatesof the probability of relevance of the retrieved data with minimumsquare errors.andP;  This approach models estimates of actualprobabilities of relevance, handles highly complex document andquery representations, and handles multivalued relevance scales.andO;Details of the implementation, equations and application of theLSP approach are described; problems with log-linear functions andsample size are noted.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Query ProcessingPolynomialsProbabilistic AutomataInformation Storage and RetrievalData Base ModelsSearchingOptimizationIndexingApproximationTheoretical Research.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   Example for the LSP approach, binary relevance scale.
