Under the policy, the agency will attempt to shorten significantly the human-testing stage for such drugs, which are normally tested in a three-stage process.    The agency said it will work with drug researchers to design experiments that lead to more complete results during the first two stages of the human-testing process, thereby eliminating the final phase. Under current procedures, scientists test for toxicity of a new drug in the first human trials. In the second phase, usually on a small group of subjects, they test a drug for effectiveness before a much broader final phase conducted at several testing centers during a longer period of time.    Human trials for many new drugs last three to seven years, after months of laboratory and animal testing. The FDA then can take from three months to three years to approve a drug for general marketing, depending on the quality of the research data.    Human testing on zidovudine, or AZT, the only FDA-approved drug for treating AIDS, was completed in a shorter-than-normal 14 months because the agency worked with researchers on the project. The drug was then released for use by thousands of patients before it was officially approved for marketing. This approach, the early release of still experimental drugs to patients in life-threatening situations, also will be speeded by the policy announced yesterday.    Scientists and the FDA have been working to shorten the testing process on other new drugs. For instance, in reporting results of toxicity tests, researchers often look for and disclose indications of how well a drug works against a particular disease, even though the trial usually involves only a small number of patients.    The FDA said in a news release that the plan was developed at the request of Vice President George Bush, who served as chairman of the administration's Task Force on Regulatory Relief. But an agency spokesman acknowledged that Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, wasn't mentioned in previous news releases on the subject.    The vice president met with FDA Commissioner Frank Young last year about treating some patients with experimental drugs and again last August about the new policy, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
