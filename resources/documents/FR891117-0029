Susling, Jr., ActingAssistant Director for Education Policy and Program Administration, VocationalRehabilitation and Education Service, Veterans' Benefits Administration,(202) 233-2092.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>VA is proposing to amend various regulationsand to remove a regulation in order to implement several provisions ofPublic Law 100-689 which affect the Dependents' Educational AssistanceProgram and the Vietnam Era GI Bill. These provisions permit pursuit ofa high school diploma for all trainees in the Dependents' Educational AssistanceProgram; provide for an increase in the maximum monthly tutorial assistanceand the maximum tutorial assistance available to trainees under both programs;and provide for a liberalization of the rules concerning the adjustmentof the monthly payment of benefits following the withdrawal from one ormore courses.VA finds that good cause exists for making the amendments to andSection;andSection;21.4200, 21.4201, and 21.4137(h), like the sections of Public Law 100-689they implement, retroactively effective on November 10, 1988. VA findsthat good cause exists for making andSection;andSection; 21.4136 and 21.4137(h),like the section of law they implement retroactively effective on June1, 1989. VA finds that good cause exists for making the remainder of theregulations and the removal of andSection; 21.4252(f), like the provisionsof law they implement, retroactively effective on August 15, 1989. To achievethe maximum benefit of the legislation for the affected individuals, itis necessary to implement these provisions of law as soon as possible.A delayed effective date would be contrary to statutory design; would complicateadministration of these provisions of law; and might result in denial ofa benefit to a veteran or eligible person who is entitled by law to it,or in the granting of a benefit to a veteran or eligible person who isnot entitled to it.VA has determined that these proposed regulations do not contain a majorrule as that term is defined by E.O. 12291, entitled Federal Regulation.The regulations will not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy,and will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for anyone. Theywill have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has certified that these proposed regulations,if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-602. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the amended regulations,therefore, are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibilityanalyses requirements of andSection;andSection; 603 and 604.This certification can be made because the regulations affect only individuals.They will have no significant economic impact on small entities, i.e.,small businesses, small private and nonprofit organizations and small governmentaljurisdictions.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for the programsaffected by these regulations are 64.111 and 64.117.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 21 </ITAG>Civil rights, Claims, Education, Grant programs-education, Loan programs-education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Schools, Veterans, Vocationaleducation, Vocational rehabilitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: October 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
