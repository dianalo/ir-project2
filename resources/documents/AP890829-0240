Wilder, company president, during a newsconference at the 1989 Automotive Parts and Accessories Show.   Under the program, recycling units are to be established atservice centers by mid-1990 to capture escaped particles of theCFC-12 coolant, known as Freon, and allow them to be reused.   The chemical breakup of CFC-12 and other chlorofluorocarbons _``CFCs'' _ in the earth's upper atmosphere has been linked to thedepletion of the earth's protective ozone layer and the warming ofthe atmosphere known as the ``greenhouse effect.''   IG-LO also plans to eliminate inexpensive ``do-it-yourself''coolant-injection kits with a high potential for misuse.   They are to be replaced by ``deluxe diagnostic kits'' costingabout five times more and designed for the sophisticated car owner,considered more likely to follow directions aimed at protecting theenvironment. The new kits are expected to go on the market inJanuary 1991.   IG-LO hopes elimination of the $4 to $5 kits will send users toservice centers that will eventually use the recycling units, Wildersaid.   The company also plans to invest $1 million in aconsumer-education program designed to promote proper use andrecycling of CFC-12. Displays in retail stores and public serviceannouncements are planned.   Scientists say CFCs are non-toxic when released into theatmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15 to 20 milesto the stratosphere, their chemical bonds break apart, resulting indamage to the ozone layer.   Environmentalists say car air conditioners are among the nation'ssingle biggest source of ozone depletion.   IG-LO, a Lexington, Ky.-based division of Valvoline Oil Co.,bills itself as the nation's leading marketer of automotiverefrigerant.   Under an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol,the United States and 37 other countries are committed to a 50percent reduction in production and consumption of CFC's by 1998.   Wilder said his industry is hoping for ``a total phase-out'' ofCFC-containing coolants by the turn of the century.   The industry may be forced to address the question sooner thanthat, as several states and Congress are considering restrictions orbans on CFC-containing products, said David Gardiner, legislativedirector for the Sierra Club.   The Sierra Club, an environmental group based in San Francisco,is lobbying to phase out the use of CFCs completely by 1995,Gardiner said in a telephone interview from his Washington, D.C.,office.   IG-LO's new program ``sounds basically good,'' Gardiner said.   ``Certainly the recycling thing is a good thing to do. Withsomething like 100 million cars on the road today ... unless we dosomething, that's potentially the biggest source ofchlorofluorocarbons.''</TEXT></DOC>
