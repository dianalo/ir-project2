People working in nuclear fields need to know of theselaws and their impact on professional endeavors. Export of technicaldata means the communication of any information by oral, written, orany other means to foreign nationals within or outside the US. The mediumfor the communication may be a model, blueprint, sketch, or any otherdevice that can convey information. If the data relates to items on oneof the control lists, a license must be sought from the appropriatedfederal agency. The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL), thoughnot itself a control list, plays a major role in determining what technicaldata will require a validated license. The US Department of Energy (DOE),through Technical Working Gorup (TWG) 11, is responsible for the NuclearTechnology chapter of the MCTL. TWG 11 also prepares the Nuclear TechnologyReference Book (NTRB), a classified guide to sensitive nuclear technology.</TEXT></DOC>
