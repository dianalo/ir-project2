The decision, written by Justice Byron White, continues the court's recent trend of curtailing the rights of high school students, a marked change of direction from a major ruling in 1969 when the justices declared that students don't &quot;shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.&quot;    In yesterday's ruling, the justices upheld the 1983 decision of a high school principal in Hazelwood, Mo., to delete two pages of a student newspaper because he objected to articles about pregnancy and divorce. The high court said the principal didn't violate the First Amendment rights of the student editors who sued.    The court said students' First Amendment rights come into play &quot;only when the decision to censor a school-sponsored publication, theatrical production, or other vehicle of student expression has no valid educational purpose. . . .&quot;    The Hazelwood principal, the court said, was legitimately concerned that, in several stories, the privacy of pregnant students or their boyfriends wasn't protected, that younger students would be exposed to &quot;inappropriate&quot; discussion of sex and birth control, and that a divorced father should have a chance to respond to criticisms by his daughter.    The high court said school-sponsored newspapers and similar activities aren't intended as a public forum for student views, but are part of the curriculum and must be subject to official control to meet the purposes of such programs.    The court's ruling prompted a sharp dissent, written by Justice William Brennan and joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun. Describing the principal's action as &quot;brutal censorship,&quot; the dissent said, &quot;Such unthinking contempt for individual rights . . . is particularly insidious from one to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an appreciation for (our) cherished democratic liberties. . . .&quot;    The censorship, the dissent said, &quot;. . . in no way furthers the curricular purposes of a student newspaper, unless one believes that the purpose of the school newspaper is to teach students that the press ought never report bad news, express unpopular views, or print a thought that might upset its sponsors.&quot;    Although the Hazelwood paper was produced for a journalism class, &quot;the language (in the high court decision) seems broad enough to apply to extra-curricular papers, too, as long as they are official papers,&quot; said Ivan Gluckman, counsel to the National Association of Secondary School Principals, which was pleased with the ruling.    But lawyers who represent the news media in First Amendment disputes weren't happy. &quot;This cuts the legs out from under the student press,&quot; said Bruce Sanford, a Washington lawyer. The stories in the case &quot;were fine examples of what we want students to report on.&quot;    The ruling is the latest to suggest limits on the constitutional rights of high school students. In 1986, the high court ruled that officials may prohibit student speeches in school that are &quot;vulgar,&quot; although not obscene by legal standards. And in 1985, it said that, to maintain an orderly learning atmosphere, school officials may search students and their belongings without the probable cause the Constitution requires for most searches.    Federal Employee Liability   The high court ruled that federal officials only enjoy absolute immunity from lawsuits for damages if their actions were within the scope of their job and involved the exercise of some discretion or judgment. The ruling narrows the immunity for federal officials that the justices recognized in a 1959 decision.    In an 8-0 decision written by Justice Marshall, the high court rejected a plea by the Reagan administration, which had argued that absolute immunity from lawsuits for injuries should apply to all actions within the scope of an official's job, but that there shouldn't be an additional requirement that the official be exercising discretion.    The ruling will make it tougher for federal officials to rely on their jobs for protection, and they may find it harder to have lawsuits against them dismissed before trial.    The case involved a civilian employee at an Army depot in Anniston, Ala., who suffered chemical burns when toxic soda ash spilled. He sued three federal supervisors for negligence in the storing of the ash.    A federal district court dismissed the case before trial, ruling that the officials were immune from suit solely because the incident fell within the scope of their jobs. But a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled in 1986 that the supervisors weren't entitled to absolute immunity just because they acted within the scope of their duties and that the case should go to trial.    The high court sent the case back to the district court to decide whether the supervisors were performing duties involving enough discretion to justify absolute immunity. The court said it is only when decision-making by officials might be hindered by the threat of lawsuits, such as in the exercise of discretion, that absolute immunity is appropriate. </TEXT></DOC>
