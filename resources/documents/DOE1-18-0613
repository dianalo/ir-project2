Ananalysis of the exhaust gases from the blast furnance led to the recommendationof the use of methane instead of fuel oil in combustion. The resultingreduction in sulfur oxides would reduce corrosion of the heat exchangersurfaces. Another recommendation for the maintenance of the exchangerinvolved the injection of manganese oxide for the pre-treatment of theexhaust gases. A follow-up technical-economic analysis justified thecapital costs of the proposed heat recovery system.</TEXT></DOC>
