The year-ago quarter included a $97.6 million pretaxcharge for restructuring its troubled video entertainmentsegment. The latest quarter's results reflect a charge of twocents a share for post-retirement employee health benefits.The satellite company, based in Washington, said in August itwas adopting the new accounting standards for retireebenefits. The charge totaled $43 million for the year.</LP><TEXT>   Revenue jumped 21% to $141.3 million from $116.8 million,partly because Comsat didn't take year-end tariff reductions.The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates muchof Comsat's business, allowed the company to count a portionof the accounting charge as part of the costs for itsregulated operations. Comsat therefore didn't have to cutprices to be within the authorized rate of return.</TEXT></DOC>
