The development of this cell was made to use on the ETS-4 to belaunched on 1992 and to evaluate in the actual space environment. Inthis cell, the oxygen generates from the positive electrode by the overchargebut this oxygen reacts immediately to hydrogen on platinum of the negativeelectrode to produce water. This water is returned to the separator,so that the electrode reaction is not impeded. Hydrogen gas generatesfrom the nickel electrode with the discharge but this hydrogen is consumedby the discharge reaction of the hydrogen electrode and therefore thereis never danger to cause the imbalance of active materials. This cellhas a special feature capable of recognizing the residual capacity bymonitoring the inner pressure. (3 figs, 1 ref)</TEXT></DOC>
