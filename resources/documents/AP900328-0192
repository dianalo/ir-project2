The rise sent prices plunging on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.   The dollar closed at 158.63 yen in active trading, up 1.67 yenfrom Tuesday's close of 156.96 yen. It opened at 158.30 yen andranged between 158.15 yen and 158.85 yen.   The currency now has gained 6.43 yen in Tokyo in nine tradingdays.   The dollar's close was its highest since it finished the day at158.05 yen on Jan. 12, 1987.   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 562.39 points, or 1.77percent, closing at 31,263.57. The index fell 14.53 points Tuesday,following a 1,468.33-point surge on Monday.   An analyst with Nomura Securities Co., who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said stock investors were reluctant to make purchasesbecause of uncertainies in the market caused by the yen's rapiddecline against the dollar.   Volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 600million shares, down from 700 million shares on Tuesday.   A Bank of Tokyo official said the central bank intervened in themarket by selling about $1 billion to prop up the yen. The Bank ofJapan usually does not comment on its market interventions.   ``Unless the political or economic situation changes, we canexpect this thing to continue,'' Chemical Bank dealer RichardCameron said of the dollar's rise.   ``The dollar has been so strong, and its rising pace is veryfast,'' said Shinichi Kato of Mitsui Bank.   Kato said large demand for the dollar was pushing the U.S.currency higher. Importers, many of whom are afraid that the dollarwill rise further, are jumping at the dollar whenever it movesdownward, he said.   Kato also blamed the lack of coordinated market interventionamong central banks for the dollar's swift ascent.   ``The Bank of Japan alone can no longer control the situation,''he said. ``The dollar's upward momentum has become too strong now.''   At a regular news conference Wednesday, Bank of Japan GovernorYasushi Mieno said it is hard to understand why the yen continuesto fall when Japan continues to run large trade surpluses.   High exports would be expected to boost demand for the yen.   But Mieno suggested that tensions in the Soviet Union anddevelopments in Europe, together with factors connected with theend of Japan's fiscal year, were boosting the dollar in foreignexchange markets.   The major monetary nations will continue cooperativeintervention aimed at strengthening the yen and chances were goodfor stability returning to the market, he said.   Overall, Mieno said he sees no immediate threats to Japan'scurrent economic expansion, which has continued for 40 consecutivemonths.   Because the U.S. Federal Reserve Board took no measures in themarket on Tuesday, Japanese market players began to speculate thatthe United States approves of the current dollar-yen rate, saidKato.   ``The dollar will soon hit the 160-yen level. It's just a matterof time,'' he added.   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds closedat 86.14 points, up from Tuesday's close of 86.03. Their yielddeclined to 7.320 percent from 7.345 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
