(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>NEC CORP. 33-1 Shiba 5-chome Minato-ku, Tokyo 108,Japan (81-3)-454-1111andM;In 1989, NEC Corp. recognized that the market in Japan for intelligentbuildings  (IB), which sport integrated information  systems  (IS) facilities, is an excellent way to  leverage its expertise in computers andcommunications (Candamp;C).andP;  To better serve the V200 billion ($1.5 billion) marketthat is growing at 20% per annum, NEC upgraded its section devoted to IBengineering to a division, called the Candamp;C Intelligent Building SystemsDivision.andP;  As of July 1989, NEC's share of the market was 15%, which thecompany hopes to boost to 20% by mid-1992.andM;Pioneering new markets is important for NEC.andP;  Its IS revenues for the periodbetween September 1988 and September 1989 were Y1.58 trillion  $11,5 billion)or nearly 50% of total sales, and represented an 18% gain over calendar year1988 figures.andP;  NEC's net income was down marginally to  Y71.6 billion ($518.9million)?andM;Supercomputing is not a new market for NEC, but the company is busy trying toincrease its market share in the United States and Europe, selling the newsx-3 through both direct and local sales subsidiaries.andP;  In the United States,NEC is marketing the sx-3 through its sales subsidiary, SX-3 SupercomputersInc, The sx-3 series should be available on the U.S.andP;  market sometime betweenjuly and September of this year.andP;  NEC says it hopes to avoid trade frictionwith Washington by concentrating supercomputer sales in the private sector.andM;NEC made new mainframe and midrange product introductions in 1989 toreinforce and expand its market share.andP;  The ACOS mainframe line acquired anew midrange model, the ACOS-3400, running at between 1.3 and 9.3 millioninstructions per second.andP;  Meanwhile, sales of the smaller Acos 3300 (0.5 to2.3 MIPS) series continues to be strong; a total of 2,000 were sold in Japanand-overseas between its introduction in late 1987 and September 1989.andP;  Aspart of its ongoing, heated competition with Fujitsu Ltd. and others in theJapanese small-business computer (SBC) market, the company introduced a32-bit laptop model of its 3100 series of SBCs.andM;Meanwhile, at the other end of the market, NEC unveiled in October anotebook-sized personal computer which is 1.7 inches thick and weighs in at 6pounds.andP;  This PC-9801N is marketed as the 98 Note.andP;  The popularity ofnotebook computers, among Japan's users, particularly in finance, contributedto the company shipping 20,000 units in December alone.andP;  The 98 Note iscompatible with NEC's PC-9800 series of PC-s for which 4,800 applicationsoftware packages are available.andP;  Overseas, NEC unveiled a similar unit, theUltralite, which is a scant 1.1 inches thick and weighs 4.4 pounds.andP;  Thedifference is that the Ultralite uses integrated circuit cards rather thanfloppy disks.andM;Another attempt to increase market share last year, this time in theexploding local government is market, put NEC smack in the middle of the  Y1discount&quot; scandal.andP;  The incident caused NEC, as well as Fujitsu, to comeunder harsh criticism for locking out competitors and denigrating the valueof software development by submitting below-cost Y1 bids for two localgovernment computer system design contracts.andP;  Both companies have promisednot to do so again, but the high-growth potential of the local governmentmarket will keep it a tempting target for undercutting the competition.andM;FUJITSU LTD. Marunouchi Center Building 6-1 Marunouchi 1-chome Chiyoda-ku,Tokyo I 00, Japan (81-3)-216-3211andM;For Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's biggest computer maker, 1989 was the Year of FMTowns, its new 80386-based 32-bit personal computer.andP;  Fujitsu sees FM Towns,which uses a compact disc read only memory  CD-ROM) drive, sports arcadecaliber graphics and impressive sound, as the centerpiece of its challenge toNEC Corp.'s dominance of the Japanese PC market.andP;  However, despite thecompany's high hopes for FM Towns, the PC has received less than ravereviews, which did not measure up to Fujitsu's expectations.andM;The marketing strategy for FM Towns had several problems.andP;  One may have beentrying to market it initially as a home computer.andP;  Although it sells for lessthan Y406,000 ($2,900), most Japanese consumers consider that a lot of money,not to mention a lot of computer, for a home PC used for video games andtypically simple home applications.andP;  Later in the year, Fujitsu seemed tochange its mind about the best market for FM Towns, reorienting its campaigntoward businesses.andM;Another problem seemed to be a lack of CD-ROM-based software, particularlyfor business use.andP;  The company admits that the slower than anticipated paceof CD-ROM software development hindered sales.andP;  Indeed, at about 5,000 unitsa month, early sales lagged far behind initial projections of 7,700 units amonth through March 1990.andP;  The company says that at a Fujitsu productshowcase in the latter half of the year, it demonstrated to customers aconsiderably larger repertoire of business software.andP;  This may have helpedsales, which, Fujitsu claims, picked up toward the end of 1989.andM;Sales of FM Towns in both markets must continue to increase if Fujitsu is toreach its goal of capturing 30% of Japan's PC market over the next threeyears.andP;  The firm now has just over 13% of that market on a production-volumebasis.andM;Despite initially slow sales for FM Towns, overall information systemsrevenues for Fujitsu, for the period between September 1988 and September1989, grew to VI.6 trillion  $11.4 billion), about 11.4% higher than calendar1988 sales.andM;Other PC news for Fujitsu in 1989 includes its purchase of a 38% stake inSunnyvale, Calif.-based Poqet Computer Corp. and the introduction of itsfirst color laptop, the 32-bit FMR-50LX6.andP;  The deal was designed to helpPoqet market its PQ/XT, a pocket-sized IBM-compatible PC that operates on twodry cell batteries for more than 100 hours.andP;  It is scheduled to go on sale inautumn of 1990.andM;In the Japanese mainframe market, Fujitsu held on to its lead, with a 32%share in terms of units sold.andP;  In June, eight months after Fujitsu paid IBM$833 million to settle their software copyright dispute, the Japanesecomputer giant introduced MSP-EX, a new operating system, which Fujitsu saysboosts compatibility between its mainframes and IBM'S.andP;  The system is capableof 1 million transactions per hour, 10 times faster than previous Fujitsuoperating systems.andP;  In September, Fujitsu announced it will export MSP-EX toWest Germany's Siemens AG on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis,in what it says is a first for a Japanese computer company.andM;Fujitsu, along with rival NEC, found itself in hot water last summer when itsubmitted preemptive VI bids for two local government computer system designcontracts.andP;  Both companies withdrew the bids after the Japanese  -air TradeCommission warned that such practices could be punishable under theAnti-Monopoly Law-but not before after they had received a lot of bad press.andM;HITACHI LTD. 6 Kanda-Surugadai 4-chome Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101, Japan(81-3)-258-1111andM;Hitachi Ltd. continued to concentrate on the domestic information systemsmarket in 1989 in its ongoing effort to counteract the effect; of the strongyen.andP;  The company also took strides to keep up with other Japanese is firmsmaking aggressive moves to enhance long-term prospects overseas.andP;  Hitachi'soverall sales between September 1988 and September 1989 rose 13% overcalendar year 1988 figures to V6.8 trillion ($49.1 billion).andP;  Computers ledthat growth, with sales for the year ending September 1989 reaching  (1.2trillion ($8.7 billion), up about f3.8% over calendar 1988's computer sales.andM;Hitachi's increased attention to the midrange and workstation arena aid off,reaping sales of Y75 billion  1544 million).andP;  The major customers that havebeen the key to this growth are banks, financial firms and securitiescompanies.andP;  Hitachi sees great growth potential in the manufacturing anddistribution industries, as more Japanese companies in those sectorscomputerize their operations.andP;  In order to meet what it expects to be anincrease in demand for workstations, Hitachi last summer unveiled new 16-bitand 32-bit models in its 2020 and 2050 series.andM;To boost demand for supercomputers and to offset criticism that Japanesecomputer makers offer academic institutions unreasonably big discounts forsupercomputer rentals, Hitachi reduced rental changes to all of its customerson all four models of its HITAC S-820 supercomputer series by 25 to 35% inSeptember.andP;  With an eye to its future in supercomputing, Hitachi developed anexperimental superconductive supercomputer in 1989.andP;  The experimental unitfeatures Josephson Junction processors and can carry out 250 millionoperations per second.andM;Overseas moves for Hitachi last year included its $398 million Aprilpurchase, in cooperation with Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS), ofNational Advanced Systems Inc. (NAS), the mainframe subsidiary of NationalSemiconductor Corp. NAS became Hitachi Data Systems Corp., with the Japanesefirm holding an 80% share.andP;  The move was hailed as a bold one and has two keyadvantages, according to Hitachi.andP;  It ensures that NAS will continue toremarket Hitachi IBM-compatible mainframes and memory devices in the UnitedStates and Europe, and the link with EDS should strengthen Hitachi's hand insoftware development.andM;In Europe, where its is sales remain weak  Hitachi announced that HitachiSemiconductor (Europe) GmbH, established in 1980, will begin integratedproduction of semiconductors in 1992 in Landshut, West Germany.andP;  Work on theLandshut plant is set to begin this spring.andP;  In anticipation of increasedbusiness in Eastern Europe, Hitachi has set up a section in its internationaldivision to deal exclusively with that part of the world.andM;Meanwhile, Hitachi Europe's research and development division' establishedtwo laboratories in 1989.andP;  One, in Cambridge, England, will conductmicroelectronics research, whereas the other, in Dublin, will engage ininformation science research.andP;  Hitachi also established its first labs in theUnited States-one in San Francisco for semiconductor-related Randamp;D and theother in Detroit for auto industry-related research.andM;TOSHIBA CORP. 1-1 Shibaura 1-chome Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-0 1, Japan(81-3)-457-4511andM;Last year, Toshiba  Corp. took Japan's laptop market by storm with Dynabook,which weighs just under 6 pounds, and at V190,000  $1,375), costs less thanhalf the price of Seiko Epson Corp.'s similar model.andP;  Just over six monthsafter its july launch, Dynabook surpassed its annual sales target of 60,000units, and Toshiba is now confident of selling another 60,000 by this summer.andO;Seven months after its launch, Toshiba introduced six new Dynabook versions,one of which includes a hard disk.andP;  &quot;Dynabook brought computers within thereach even of university students,&quot; says Shigenori Matsushita of Toshiba'sInformation  Processing Group.andP;  He adds: &quot;Our product actually helped expandJapan's PC market as a whole.&quot;andM;Despite a rapid 20% annual growth, Japan's PC market is less than one-tenththe size of the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  Even at Toshiba's central Tokyo office, thereis only one PC unit for every two or three employees.andP;  Indeed, keyboards arestill alien to most Japanese, who have been brought up on brush and inkrather than typewriters; many middle-aged Japanese have never touched akeyboard of any kind.andP;  &quot;It mainly stems from our cultural tradition,&quot;explains Matsushita.andP;  &quot;But it means that there is room for growth [in PCuse].&quot;andM;Internationally, Toshiba has a reputation for laptop computers, but thosesales constitute merely 30% of the company's total information systemsrevenues.andP;  The overwhelming majority of sales is generated by midrangecomputers, workstations and  peripherals-with  the midrange remaining thecore of Toshiba's domestic computer business.andP;  Toshiba does not producemainframe computers, but is beginning to succeed in muscling into this marketwith a system that combines sophisticated midrange computers andmicrocomputers.andP;  &quot;The traditional computer system in major corporations of abig host computer and dozens of dumb terminals has proven to be  highly inefficient,&quot;  explains Matsushita.andP;  Over the past 10 years, Toshiba has beendeveloping decentralized systems using midrange computers, sales of whichMatsushita expects to increase by 12% this yearandM;Toshiba's is revenues were V634 billion ($4.6 billion) for the period fromSeptember 1988 to September 1989, with net income at V129 billion ($935million).andM;Over 100 hotels in Japan, including those owned by the fast-growing All NiponAirways-Japan's No.2 carrier-have so far installed Toshiba's midrangesystems.andP;  Hospitals are another area of Toshiba's strength for these systems.andO;However, these sales successes have so far been limited to the domesticmarket, unlike Toshiba's success with its laptop products.andP;  &quot;You have todevelop close relations with your clients-something that's very difficult todo in foreign markets,&quot; says Matsushita.andP;  &quot;In the PC markets, it's adifferent matter altogether; the products sell themselves.&quot;andP;  That Toshiba wasquick off the mark in tapping into huge overseas PC markets alsoandM;Toshiba's best-selling laptops-the 3100, 2100 and 1100 series-were alllaunched first overseas, and the company now commands a 48% share in Europeand a 28% share in the United States.andP;  In 1987, Toshiba opened a U.S.andO;manufacturing base in Irvine, Calif., which has an annual output of 15,000units.andP;  Toshiba's West German plant was scheduled to begin operations this past April, producing 5,000 units annually.andP;  Most components for both plantsare supplied locally, with the exception of flat displays, keyboards, floppydisks and large scale integrated circuits.andP;  &quot;These are the components whichhave to be shipped directly from Japan to ensure high quality,&quot; saysMatsushita.andM;Via a recent original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with SunMicrosystems Inc., Toshiba is also intent on expanding its share of Japan'sworkstation market.andP;  &quot;We mean to be No.1 in every area of our computerbusiness,&quot; Matsushita concludes confidently.andM;CANON INC. Shinjuku Daiichi Seimei Building 7-1 Nishi-shinjuku 2-chomeShinjuku-ku, Tokyo 163, Japan (81-3)-348-2121andM;Peripherals brightened up an otherwise dull year at Canon Inc., as  sales oflaser printers and facsimile machines boosted information systems revenuesfor the 12 months ended in September 1989 by a robust 20% over calender 1988figures up to Y522 billion ($3.8 billion).andP;  Indeed, sales of peripheralsalone, primarily laser printers, increased 529c to (270 billion i$2 billion).andO;The company's overall sales rose 18% to VI.3 trillion ($9.8 billion), but netincome stayed almost the same as that for the 1988 calendar year, at V38.2billion ($276.9 million).andM;Canon, one of the most aggressive seekers of business around, has continuedto increase its activities overseas, with a 74% export ratio, 63% of which isdenominated in U.S.andP;  dollars.andP;  In the first half of the year, the firmconcluded its contracts at a rate of Y127 to the dollar, but with the yendropping below 150 to the dollar, Canon's earnings picture will likely changeradically for the better.andM;Canon's dominance of the laser printer field continues unchallenged.andP;  Thefirm has 70% of the domestic laser printer market and 80% of the overseasmarket.andP;  In March of 1989, the company announced plans to build a factory inBritain within the next two years to produce laser printers and fax machines.andM;Canon's strength in peripherals contrasts with its continued weak showing inthe rest of the Japanese is market, where analysts say the company's futureremains very much in doubt.andP;  In an effort to get a leg up in the computerfield, Canon paid  $100 million in june for one-sixth of Steve jobs' NextInc. and exclusive marketing rights in Asia for the Next machine.andP;  While someobservers see Canon's move as an attempt to develop its own computerbusiness, the firm says the deal represents merely an ideal hardware/softwarecombination.andP;  Canon has set up its own software development group and expectsto have Japanese software ready for the Next computer by this summer.andP;  TheNext machine uses Canon's 5/4-inch erasable optical disk, which has 256megabytes of memory.andP;  Analysts say the disks are likely to become a majorproduct line for Canon, and one estimate is that they will earn the companymore than Y100 billion ($725 million) by 1995.andM;Whether that can be realized depends on whether Canon learned from itsfailures in marketing Apple Computer Inc.'s systems in Japan in themid-1980s.andP;  Having little experience in marketing integrated informationsystems, Canon failed to provide adequate maintenance for both hardware andsoftware.andP;  Now, the company plans to focus on supporting Next systems in thiseffort.andM;Meanwhile, Canon found itself in hot water with Japan's Fair Trade Commission(FTC) in October.andP;  The FTC raided 39 Canon sales offices in search ofevidence that the company had been trying to keep prices of Apple computershigh by shutting out of the market those  distributors that were undercuttingCanon's Apple prices.andP;  Reports said that Canon had pressured magazines not totake advertisements from such companies.andP;  The FTC has yet to file its report,but skeptical observers note that while Japanese  law can order companies tohalt the practices, the FTC does not have the power to impose fines or otherforms of punishment.andM;In management, Canon had one major change in 1989.andP;  Executive vice presidentKeizo Yamaji took over Canon's presidency in February, while Ryuzaburo Kakumoved from the presidency to the chairmanship.andM;MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL CO. LTD. 1006 Oazakadoma Kadoma-shi, Osaka-fu5 7 1, Japan (81-6)-908-1121andM;Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. successfully continued its increasedemphasis on information systems last year.andP;  While many areas of Japan'sconsumer electronics market approach saturation, Matsushita's is division isprospering, once more leading other company sectors in growth.andP;  For the yearending September 1989, the is division had revenues of Y506 billion ($3.7billion), up 15% over calendar 1988 figures.andP;  Meanwhile, the firm's overallrevenues rose 9.4% to Y5.6 trillion ($40.9 billion).andM;Whether Matsushita will ultimately join the ranks of Fujitsu Ltd. and NECCorp. in the is business remains to be seen.andP;  Realizing it cannot hope tointroduce an entire range of systems in one fell swoop, the company haschosen to concentrate its efforts on PCs and workstations, areas that seem tohave the greatest  potential.andP;  Having abandoned the mainframe field in 1964,Matsushita has no plans to reenter that arena.andM;In October, Matsushita introduced to the domestic market the first model inits UNix-based 32-bit BE office workstation series, which it hopes willcapture a good share of Japan  s growing office automation market.andP;  Lastyear, Matsushita also shifted production of its 32-bit engineeringworkstations to the United States.andP;  The workstations are designed byLongmont, Colo.-based Solbourne Computer Inc., of which Matsushita is partowner.andM;Matsushita resumed exports of PCs to Europe and North America last fall forthe first time since 1987, in the wake of with the resolution of a copyrightdispute with IBM which had forced it to halt overseas PC shipments.andO;Matsushita is now making 8-,16- and 32-bit IBM-compatible laptops in Japan tobe sold in Europe under the Panasonic brand name, while Tandy Co .andP;  is making16- and 32-bit models in the United States on an original equipmentmanufacturing (OEM) basis.andP;  Similarly, Fujitsu last year began supplyingMatsushita with its 32-bit FM Towns PC on an OEM basis for the Japanesedomestic market.andM;To help make inroads into the PC market, where it is still an also-ran,Matsushita last year set up the Matsushita Computer Co. (MAC) in Tokyo tospecialize in workstation sales, support and systems integration.andP;  In adeparture from standard Japanese corporate practice, Matsushita has luredexperienced Personnel away from other companies rather than staffing MAC withMatsushita employees.andP;  Althogh MAC will be headed by  Matsushita  managingdirector Shigeuki Nishiuma, it will have considerable autonomy in day-to-dayoperations.andM;Although Matsushita lost its founder, Konosuke Matsushita, in April 1989 atthe age of 94, the company has gone on with little change.andP;  In March of lastyear, Richard Kraft, a 15-year veteran of Matsushita's U.S.andP;  operations, wasappointed to the post of president and chief operating officer,  succeedingAkiya Imura.andP;  As the first American to the position, he may help Matsushitadeal more effectively with  U.S.andP;  concern about Japanese trade and investmentpolicies in the United States.andM;NTT DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS CORP. 17 Mori Building 26-5 Toranomon 1-chomeMinato-ku, Tokyo 105,Japan (81-3y5O9-4647andM;While its parent company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT),flounders as the result of the arrest of three former executives for briberyand the prospect of being broken up into smaller companies, NTT DataCommunications Systems Corp. continues to do well.andP;  Since being spun off fromNTT in May of 1988, NTT Data has taken the lead in Japan's annual V348billion ($2.5 billion) systems integration market, which is a growing at arate of some 32% per year.andP;  Because it is the only company in Japan thathandles all aspects of systems integration-designing, installing, operatingand maintaining information systems-NTT Data looks well positioned tomaintain its No.andP;  I spot.andM;In its first  (partial) year of operations, from May 1988 to March 31, 1989,NTT Data registered a net loss of Y7.6 billion ($59 million) on sales of Y228billion ($1.8 billion) because of a one-time transfer of retirement benefitsfrom NTT.andP;  But for the year that ended September 30, 1989, the companyrecorded a net income of Y3.2 billion ($23.5 million) on sales of Y31.1billion ($225 billion).andP;  NTT still owns 100% of NTT Data, but if thesubsidiary continues registering a solid business performance, its sharesshould be listed publicly in 1992.andM;Large public and financial concerns account for 80% of NTT Data's sales, butthe firm is targeting smaller companies, especially in the manufacturingfield, in the belief that their demand for systems integration will grow.andO;Analysts say NTT Data's ability to market its services is the key to itsfuture.andM;In response to Japan's shortage of software engineers, NTT Data last year setup software development offices in Japanese regional centers such as Nagoya,Osaka and Sapporo.andP;  Each office will be staffed with about 10 softwarespecialists assigned by the Tokyo headquarters; NTT Data's goal is to have atleast 100 employees at each office.andM;One of NTT Data's biggest projects in 1989 was designing a system usingHitachi Ltd. mainframes and Fujitsu Ltd. terminals for the TokyoInternational Financial Futures Exchange, which began operations in June.andO;Another highlight of 1989 was the increased use of NTT Data's AutomaticAnswer Network  for Electronic Request (ANSER) system, through which bankcustomers can gain access to information concerning their accounts by usingfax machines, PCs, telephones or dedicated home use terminals.andP;  Thenationwide ANSER network now handles 25 million calls a month.andM;NIHON UNISYS LTD. 17-51 Akasaka 2-chome Minato-ku, Tokyo 107,Japan(81-3)-585-4111andM;In the face of stagnating growth in Japan's mainframe computer market, NihonUnisys Ltd. recorded a healthy 11 % growth in revenues to V291.5 billion $2.1billion) last year.andP;  &quot;We are happy with last year's results,&quot; says HiroshiYoshida, Nihon Unisys' director of corporate communications.andP;  Much of thegrowth resulted from the sale of the company's new 2200-600 midrange series.andO;New 2200-600s were installed at  Japan's second largest airline, All NipponAirways (ANA), in a multibillion-yen sale; at Japan's two leading carmanufacturing firms, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.; and alsoin Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's four major brokerage houses.andP;  The ANAdeal was the culmination of several years that Nihon Unisys spent developinga new computerized reservation system for the carrier and represented itsbiggest sale in 1989.andM;Currently, Nihon Unisys imports half its products from the United States,with the rest manufactured by Japanese companies such as Oki ElectricIndustry Co.

Ltd. and Toshiba Corp.andO;what it saw as unfair price cutting, Ricoh expects the pressure from them toabate gradually this year.andP;  Also, if demand in the United States and Europeremains strong, sales should return to a healthy 7 to 8% growth.andP;  Sales ofgroup IV facsimile machines should increase in Japan as Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Corp. expands its Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)outside major metropolitan areas.andM;Despite maintenance problems reported last year with the LP6000 laserprinter, spies of laser printers increased to the point where theyconstituted 60% of the company's V60.5 billion ($438.5 million) in sales ofperipherals..andM;Ricoh continued its aggressive expansion into domestic information systems,selling Hitachi Ltd. PCs and IBM System/ 55s and System/36s on an originalequipment manufacturer (oEm) basis and acting as a sales agent for NEC Corp.andO;OffiCe computers.andP;  The OEM policy resulted in sales of office and personalcomputers of Y17.4 billion  $106 million) and Y22.3 billion ($161.5 million),respectively, for the year ending in September 1989.andP;  However, margins  inthis area remained a low 4% in  1989, well behind Canon Inc.'s 7% profitmargins, the industry's highest.andP;  This is largely because Ricoh, unlikeCanon, does not sell its own hardware.andP;  The use of oEm equipment has alsocomplicated Ricoh's efforts to expand its is business overseas because itincreases the difficulty of addressing after-sale maintenance and softwarecompatibility problems.andP;  The company has high hopes that its new optical diskfiling systems, which employ's 5- and 12-inch erasable disks, will furtherboost its office automation revenues in the coming year.andP;  Sales of opticalequipment reached 5% of total sales  last year,andM;Sales of copiers continue to make up 55% of Ricoh's office equipment sales,despite recent efforts to diversify into information systems.andP;  The 7% gain incopier sales was due in part to efforts to add value to existing products,which include the introduction of a digitalized intelligence system employingadvanced  digital technology.andM;SEIKO EPSON CORP. 3-3-5 Owa, Suwa-shi Nagano 392,Japan (81-266)-52-3131andM;For Seiko Epson Corp., 1989 was a disappointing  marked by a seriousmarketing setback in what has long been the company's major strength--laptopcomputers.andP;  Rival Toshiba Corp.'s huge success with Dynabook dealt a crushingblow to Epson's Note, which is functionally comparable to Toshiba's model butmore than twice the price.andM;Launched almost concurrently with Dynabook and operating on two integratedcircuit  (IC) cards (128 bit and 640 bit), Note is slimmer and lighter thanToshiba's floppy disk-based product.andP;  &quot;Our aim was to develop the world'sslimmest computer to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the advent ofquartz,&quot; explains Katsuyuki Kanuma, spokesman for Epson.andP;  Note, which has abuilt-in communications system and uses a higher  quality CPU [centralprocessing unit] is far superior to Dynabook.&quot;andM;Superior technology notwithstanding, sales for Note did not even reach athird of the annual target of 10,000 units last year.andP;  But Dynabook surpassedits annual sales target in the first six months of 1989.andP;  &quot;We disregardedcommercial considerations in the product development,&quot; says Kanuma.andP;  DespiteNote's commercial failure, the company managed to nudge its informationsystems revenues upward 5% to Y200 billion ($1.4 billion).andM;&quot;This year it is our turn to fight back,&quot; says Kanuma, although the effectsof continued Dynabook success can be felt even more strongly in 1990.andP;  Tothat end, in February, Epson came back with a laptop at exactly the sameprice as Toshiba's model.andP;  The new, cheaper Note operates on a floppy disk aswell as an IC card, but is thicker and slightly heavier.andP;  Epson's first colorlaptop also should appear on the Japanese market by the middle of this year.andO;Management had planned to launch the computer last year, but decided to delayuntil it half developed a mass production technology enabling the company tocut the price to less than Y700,000  $5,000).andP;  We are not going to rush intoit.andP;  We've got to time it right,&quot; says Kanuma.andM;Essentially a printer maker, Epson still commands the top share of the globalmini-printer (a calculator-sized printer market, with total output in 1988exceeding 100 million units.andP;  Today, the company has manufacturing bases inFrance, the United Kingdom and West Germany and marketing bases in more than21 countries.andP;  In April of this year, Epson established its EuropeanCommunity headquarters in the Netherlands.andP;  Until three years ago, exportsconstituted more than two-thirds of the company's annual revenues, but withthe opening of overseas plants, the ratio has dropped to 50%.andM;The export ratio is likely to decrease even further,&quot; says Kanuma.andM;Would Epson consider tying up with a mainframe company such as Nihon UnisysLtd. to broaden its product line in the face of ever-intensifyingcompetition? &quot;We're a very independent company, proud of its owntechnological developments.andP;  I don't think our management would even considersuch an idea,&quot; snaps Kanuma.andM;C.andP;  ITOH andamp; CO.

Market analysts blamedthose losses on price-cutting pressures fed by the stronger dollar.andP;  Alps'Korean subsidiary also suffered, mostly due to rising domestic costs fueledby the appreciation of the Korean won.andM;To help compensate, the firm has been expanding its European operations,boosting manufacturing capability for various electronic components.andP;  It wasthrough such components that Alps first entered the information-processingbusiness, and the company's strengths continue to lie in that area.andP;  In theUnited Kingdom, it boosted its videocassette recorder (VCR) componentsbusiness and last August opened a Y3.4 billion ($25 million) plant in WestGermany to make heads for audio equipment.andM;While it's obvious that Alps' printer and peripherals business has not provenprofitable, the company continues to be the world's largest independentsupplier of floppy disk drives and commands a 60% share of the world's powerswitch market.andP;

 In 1990, Mitacwill begin production of its first laptop computer.andP;  A new company, Microintegrated Communications Corp., has been established in the United States todevelop the company's capabilities in communications.andP;  Mitac's purchase of12% of Wyse Technology last year was also a part of this diversification.andM;In eyeing its information technology future, Mitac closely scrutinizes themoves of its most bitter rival, Acer.andP;

 The company made two majoroverseas investments designed to reduce its dependence on its mainstayceramics business and place increased emphasis on data communications andelectronic parts and components.andP;  The moves were also seen as a way torecover from a downturn in earnings in the second half of the year caused byreduced semiconductor demand in the United States.andM;In late july, Kyocera bought California-based electronics parts maker ElcoCorp. for $250 million, giving the firm full control of a number of Elcocompanies in various countries, including Japan, South Korea, the UnitedKingdom and West Germany.andP;  At the end of September, Kyocera bought anotherU.S.andP;  electronics parts maker, Avx Corp., for stock valued at $561 million.andO;Kyocera says the buyout of Avx-which has a strong manufacturing presence inEurope-was aimed at giving the company a production foothold in Europe inpreparation for the 1992 European Community market integration.andM;The new emphasis on electronic equipment is in keeping with chairman KazuoInamori's principle of keeping innovation within the company.andP;
