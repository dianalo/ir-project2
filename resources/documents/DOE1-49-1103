These compositions reacted with iodine to yieldsulfate in the solid phase and hydrogen iodide in the gas phase. Highyields of hydrogen iodide were measured at 770 K for a reaction timeof ten minutes. Yields also depended on the sulfite content of the hydratecompositions, and were highest when the dipraseodymium dioxymonosulfatewas 60% neutralized with sulfurous acid. An increased yield of hydrogeniodide was obtained by a second iodine oxidation after separation ofthe first gaseous products. A water splitting thermochemical cycle utilizingthese reactions is described in which hydrogen is produced by catalyticdecomposition of hydrogen iodide, and oxygen results from thermal decompositionof the solid product, that also yields sulfur dioxide and dipraseodymiumdioxymonosulfate for recycle.</TEXT></DOC>
