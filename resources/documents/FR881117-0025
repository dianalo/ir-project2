Authority</ITAG>This guideline is issued under the authority of sections 2002(a) and 6002of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6912(a) and 6962.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Introduction</ITAG>A. Purpose and ScopeThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today is issuing one in a seriesof guidelines designed to encourage the use of products containing materialsrecovered from solid waste. section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act,as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or the Act),as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6962, states that if a Federal, State, or local procuringagency uses Federal funds to procure certain designated items, such itemsmust be composed of the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable.EPA is required to designate these items and to prepare guidelines to assistprocuring agencies in complying with the requirements of Section 6002.EPA issued the first of these guidelines, for cement and concrete containingfly ash, on January 28, 1983 (48 FR 4230; 40 CFR Part 249). EPA issueda guideline for paper and paper products containing recovered materialson October 6, 1987 (52 FR 37293; 40 CFR Part 250) with concurrently proposedamendments (52 FR 37335). A revised final paper guideline was promulgatedon June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23546). EPA promulgated a final guideline for lubricatingoils containing re-refined oil on June 30, 1988 (53 FR 24699; 40 CFR Part252). A guideline for asphalt materials containing ground tire rubber wasproposed on February 20, 1986 (51 FR 6202), a guideline for retread tireswas proposed on May 2, 1988 (53 FR 15624), and a guideline for buildinginsulation products was proposed on August 2, 1988 (53 FR 29165). Today,EPA is promulgating the final retread tires guideline.This preamble describes the requirements of section 6002, explains thebasis for designating tires as a procurement item subject to section 6002,discusses EPA's recommendations for implementing section 6002 with respectto procurement of tires, and responds to comments on the proposed guideline.It also provides information regarding the price, availability, and performanceof retread tires.B. Requirements of Section 6002Section 6002 of RCRA, ``Federal Procurement,'' directs all procuring agencieswhich use Federal funds to procure items composed of the highest percentageof recovered materials practicable, considering competition, availability,technical performance, and cost. Two factors trigger this requirement.First, EPA must designate the items to which this requirement applies.Second, the requirement only applies when the purchase price of the itemexceeds $10,000 or when the quantity of such items or of functionally equivalentitems purchased or acquired in the course of the preceding fiscal yearwas $10,000 or more.Section 6002(c) requires procuring agencies to obtain from suppliers anestimate of and certification regarding the percentage of recovered materialscontained in their products.Federal agencies responsible for drafting or reviewing specifications forprocurement items were required under section 6002(d)(1) to review andrevise the specifications by May 8, 1986 in order to eliminate both exclusionsof recovered materials and requirements that items be manufactured fromvirgin materials. In addition, within one year after the date of publicationof a procurement guideline by EPA, the Federal agencies must revise theirspecifications to require the use of recovered materials in such itemsto the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intended end useof the item.Section 501 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L.98-616) added paragraph (i) to section 6002 of RCRA. This provision requiresprocuring agencies to develop an affirmative procurement program for purchasingitems designated by EPA. The program must assure that items composed ofrecovered materials will be purchased to the maximum extent practicable,be consistent with applicable provisions of Federal procurement law, andcontain at least four elements:(1) A recovered materials preference program;(2) An agency promotion program;(3) A program for requiring estimates, certification, and verificationof recovered material content; and(4) Annual review and monitoring of the effectiveness of the procurementprogram.Under section 6002(e), EPA is required to issue guidelines for use by procuringagencies in complying with the requirements of section 6002. The EPA guidelinesmust designate those items which can be produced with recovered materialsand whose procurement by procuring agencies will fulfill the objectivesof section 6002. They also must provide recommendations for procurementpractices and information on availability, relative price, and performance.Section 6002 is designated to promote materials conservation and therebyto reduce the quantity of materials in the solid waste stream. By usingproducts containing recovered materials, Federal procurement can demonstratetheir technical and economic viability. In addition, Federal procurementguidelines can provide guidance to state and local governments interestedin procuring products containing recovered materials, and Federal procurementof such products is expected to result in increased procurement of themby these other groups as well.C. Rationale for Selecting Tires for a Procurement GuidelineIn the preamble to the fly ash guideline, EPA established criteria forthe selection of procurement items for which guidelines will be prepared.However, section 6002(e) of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and SolidWaste Amendments of 1984, specifically directs the EPA Administrator toissue procurement guidelines for tires. The portion of the Conference Committeereport describing the amendments to section 6002 explains that the term``tires'' includes `'the use of retreaded tires.'' [H.R. 2867 ConferenceReport, p.1, Cong. Rec. H11138 (October 3, 1984).] Since Congress alreadyhas selected tires as an appropriate subject for a procurement guideline,it is not necessary for EPA to demonstrate that tires satisfy the EPA criteriafor selecting procurement items.However, commenters on the proposed retread tires guideline stressed toEPA that by providing information on the environmental benefits of usingretread tires, EPA would help to convince buyers to purchase retread tires.EPA agrees and is providing the following summary of information on tiresas a solid waste disposal problem.In 1986, 220 million tires were discarded. Passenger car and light trucktires account for approximately 80 percent of the total number of tiresscrapped, the remainder being bus, truck, and off-road tires (e.g., constructionequipment and agricultural equipment tires). While scrap tires often canbe retreaded, sold as used tires, or otherwise reused or recycled, theygenerally wind up in landfills, tire stockpiles, and along roadsides orwaterways.Tires cannot be easily managed in landfills. They do not biochemicallydegrade and tend to rise or float to the surface after burial, create voidsin the landfills, and provide a home for rodents and insects. Some landfillshave equipment to shred or slice tires prior to burial, but shredding isa costly process. As a result, many landfills will not accept tires atall or charge additional tipping fees for tires, often at a level highenough to discourage tires from being brought to the facility.Scrap tires often are disposed of on private property in tire stockpiles.The tire industry estimates that there are between 2 and 3 billion tiresin piles scattered throughout the United States and that these piles areincreasing by 150 to 200 million tires per year. Efforts to regulate orto eliminate these piles have been largely unsuccessful. While some ofthese tires will be recycled into crumb rubber or used as fuel, the majorityof the tires have no known use.The tire piles pose a serious threat to both public health and the environmentas a home for rodents and insects and as fuel for fires. For example, a4 million tire pile ignited in Winchester, Virginia in 1983. It took eightmonths and the combined efforts of the Federal, State, and county governmentsto contain the fire, which ultimately burned itself out. EPA alone spent$1.2 million of Superfund monies to contain and remove the oily residuegenerated by the burning tires.Thus, it is desirable to encourage a reduction in used tire disposal, andtire retreading is one means of accomplishing this end.D. Background Information on Tire RetreadingThe retreading industry was started in the 1910s. Today there are approximately2,600 retreading plants in the United States. They retread tires for aircraft(commercial and military), agricultural equipment, automobiles, light-and heavy-duty trucks, buses (school and mass transportation), off-road,vehicles (i.e., earthmovers, graders, loaders, and dozers) and racing cars.Tire retreading is the application of a new tread to a worn tire. The tireretreading process involves the following steps:andbullet; Inspection and selection of tires suitable for retreading.andbullet; Removal of the old tire tread through a buffing process.andbullet; Repair of the tire casing, if necessary.andbullet; Application of rubber cement.andbullet; Application of a new tread.andbullet; Curing.andbullet; Inspection of the retreaded tire.There are two methods for applying a new tread: the mold-cured process,in which an uncured rubber tread is applied, and the pre-cured process,in which a pre-cured, pre-molded rubber tread is applied.During the mold-cured process, uncured (i.e., nonvulcanized) rubber isapplied to the tire. The tire then is placed in a mold to form the treadpattern, the tire is internally pressurized, and the mold is heated. Thecombination of heat and air pressure applied for an appropriate periodof time vulcanizes the rubber and bonds it to the tire body.During the pre-cure process, a thin layer of uncured rubber (the bondinglayer) is applied to the tire body. The pre-cured, pre-molded rubber treadis applied over the bonding layer. The tire is then placed in an autoclaveto bond the tread to the tire body. Again, the combination of heat andair pressure applied over time vulcanizes the bonding layer and bonds itand the tread to the tire body.Two U.S. manufacturers use a bead-to-bead process, which involves replacingthe sidewall and shoulder rubber in addition to the tread. These processes,which are also known as remolding or remanufacturing, are used to manufacturepassenger car tires and ligh truck tires.A properly retreaded tire can provide the same mileage as a new tire, thussubstantially extending a tire's useful life. Tires also can be retreadedmultiple times. Truck tires, for example, are often retreaded two or threetimes.E. Current Retread Tire Procurement Procedures Procuring agencies can procure either a service_tire retreading_or a product_retreadtires. Agencies currently use different methods for procuring retreadingservices than for procuring retread tires as a product. These approachesare described below. 1. <T3>Procurement of Services. </T3>The U.S. General Services Administration(GSA) awards contracts for tire retreading services. Retreading contractsare awarded by the GSA regional offices. The regional offices then issuea supply schedule, Federal Supply Schedule No. 753II, Tire Retreading andRepairing, identifying the vendors of tire retreading services within theGSA region. The individual Federal agencies \1\<NOTE/> can bring their tires to these vendors for retreading. Thevendor retreads the tire and returns it to the procuring agency. If thetire is not retreadable (e.g., the casing is damaged), the vendor returnsit to the agency for disposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Department of Defense uses Schedule No. 753II forretreading of tactical equipment and heavy-duty truck tires, as well asfor administrative and light-duty vehicle tires. Vendors retread tires in accordance with GSA Specification ZZ-TandCx.3;441,which details the retreading procedures to be followed, including inspectionof the worn tire casing for suitability for retreading, and inspectionof the finished product. It applies to both the mold-cured and pre-curedretreading processes and to tire repairs. It covers four groups of tires:(1) Passenger car and cycles, (2) light truck and high speed industrial,(3) truck, bus and trailer, and (4) special service (including military,agricultural, off-highway, and slow speed industrial). The specification also requires that the retreader receive a mandatorypre-award facility certification of approval. According to the specification,there are two acceptable approaches that a retreader may use to have hisfacility certified: either a GSA inspector can perform the retreading facilityinspection or the retreader can provide evidence that within the previous12 months the facility has received an approved certification from a nationallyrecognized retread tire trade association. While the specification doesnot identify any particular association, EPA knows of two such organizations,the National Tire Dealers and Retreaders Association (NTDRA) and the AmericanRetreaders Association (ARA). With the exception of the Department of Defense, very few Federal governmentagencies have central motor pools to maintain and repair vehicles. Norare tires stockpiled in Federal government warehouses or depots. Instead,replacement tires are obtained from the commercial marketplace. For example, replacement tires for GSA Interagency Fleet Management Systemvehicles are, for the most part, obtained from retail tire distributionoutlets. In a limited number of locations where GSA has in-house maintenanceand repair facilities, a small number of replacement tires may be stored.Operators of GSA fleet vehicles contact one of eleven GSA maintenance controlcenters for authorization of maintenance and repairs, including tire replacement.GSA automotive technicians, using established criteria on minimum treaddepth, and in conjunction with other relevant information provided by theoperator, make the decisions on tire replacement. Retread tires may bepurchased depending on the type of vehicle (non-passenger carrying), theintended vehicle use, cost, and the availability of retread tires throughthe retail distribution system. GSA has issued two policy statements regarding use of retread tires, whichprovide vehicle operators with some criteria to use in making the decisionto procure a new tire or a tire retreading service \2\<NOTE/> GSA does not monitor procuring agencies' use of the retreadingcontracts, however. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ GSA's written policies provide that truck, bus and heavyequipment tires should be examined for retreadability. Tires of 6 ply orgreater with a minimum remaining tread depth of at least \2/32\'' shouldbe submitted to a government retread contractor for possible retreading.Retreads are recommended for use on low speed (25 miles per hour or less)on- and off-road vehicles. GSA recommends that retreads not be used onsteering axles of high speed, over-the-road vehicles. Further, GSA policiesprohibit use of retreads on passenger carrying vehicles or on the steeringaxle of any Interagency Fleet Management Vehicle used on public highwaysbut allows use of retreads on the rear wheels of large trucks, truck tractors,trailers, and off-road vehicles. Several states also procure tire retreading services. Some states use prisonretreading facilities, while others use contractors. For example, the Stateof Vermont procures retreading services for truck and aircraft tires. Thestate uses a specification which identifies the retreading process to beused (mold-cured), retread size, and tread design. It requires that theretreader use the state's casings. The state invites bids to supply retreadingservices in accordance with the specification and awards one-year contractswith two options to renew. Vermont has a central motor pool which warehouses replacement parts, includinga mix of new and retreaded tires. The motor pool staff are trained in tireinspection procedures. Each tire casing is inspected to determine whetherit can be retreaded; if it is suitable for retreading, it is sent to thecontract retreader. 2. <T3>Procurement of Products. </T3>Several methods can be used to procureretread tires as products. They generally are purchased through open competition(although the Federal Government does not use this method of procurementfor retread tires). The procuring agency invites bids from both vendorsof new tires and vendors of retread tires. The contract is awarded to thelowest-priced responsible bidder. One method is to invite bids to sell a mix of new and retread tires, inwhich agencies identify particular types or sizes of tires that they wishto purchase as retreads. Vendors then bid against the mixed list. Another method of procuring retread tires as a product is through mileageguarantees. The tire specification requires the contractor to guaranteean average mileage and to submit a performance bond. The price of eachtire is divided by the guaranteed mileage to obtain a guaranteed cost permile. If the tire does not perform for the guaranteed mileage, the costper mile is used to adjust the price of the tire. The difference betweenthe actual tire price and the adjusted price is the amount the contractormust reimburse the procuring agency. Both vendors of new tires and vendorsof retread tires can submit bids using this type of procurement specification.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Contents of the Guideline </ITAG>This portion of the preamble explains each section of the final guideline.A. Purposes and ScopeThe purposes of this guideline are (1) to designate tires as an item subjectto the procurement requirements of section 6002 of RCRA and (2) to recommendprocedures for complying with section 6002.This guideline applies to purchases of the following types of tires: Passengercar tires, light- and heavy-duty truck tires, high speed industrial tires,bus tires, and special service tires (including Military, agricultural,off-the-road, and slow speed industrial). Commenters questioned severalexclusions from the scope of the guideline as discussed below.1. <T3>Airplane Tires.</T3> The guideline does not apply to airplane tires.In the proposed guideline, EPA explained that because agencies that procureairplane tires already use retread tires extensively, it did not believethat designating airplane tires would result in increased use of retreadedairplane tires. EPA further stated that when Congress directed EPA to issuea procurement guideline for tires, it intended EPA to focus on automobile,truck, and other vehicle tires because they are a significant solid wasteproblem; the bulk of the tires in the solid waste stream are automobiletires and, to a lesser extent, truck and other vehicle tires. Several commenters stated that EPA should include airplane tires withinthe scope of the guideline. These commenters argued that airplane tiresmight not be retreaded to the maximum extent practicable, that includingthem in the guideline would insure their continued use, and that thereis no data showing that airplane tires are not a significant solid wastedisposal problem. None of the commenters submitted data supporting theirarguments. EPA has data, which has been placed in the docket for this guideline, demonstratingthat airplane tires are not a significant solid waste disposal problem.In addition, EPA believes that if an item is already extensively recycled,so that an EPA procurement guideline will not have a significant impacton recycling, it is preferable to use EPA's resources to develop guidelineswhich will have a significant impact on recycling. For these reasons, EPAis not including airplane tires within the scope of the final guidelineissued today. If EPA receives information indicating that issuing a guidelinewould have an impact on retreading of airplane tires or that the volumeof airplane tire retreading is decreasing, then EPA will consider the feasibilityof a guideline for this item.In the proposed guideline, andSection; 253.3(d)(3) provided that the guidelinedid not apply to purchases of airplane tires. Since exclusion of thesetires is really a scope issue, EPA has placed the exclusions in andSection;253.2 of the final guideline and deleted andSection; 253.3(d)(3).2. <T3>Original Equipment Tires.</T3> In the proposed guideline, EPA notedthat RCRA section 6002(i) provides that affirmative procurement programsshould be consistent with applicable provisions of Federal procurementlaw, that Federal procurement law requires Federal procuring agencies topurchase commercial products and to use commercial distribution systemswhenever such products or systems are adequate to meet the government'sneeds, and that new vehicles are purchased in accordance with this requirement.Because new vehicle manufacturers are required by National Highway TrafficSafety Administration (NHTSA) regulations to use new tires (49 CFR 571.110and 571.120), the vehicles purchased by Federal procuring agencies willbe equipped with new tires. Therefore, EPA concluded that requiring retreadtires would be contrary both to the NHTSA regulations and the FAR, andthus contrary to the requirement of RCRA section 6002(i)(1) that procuringagencies must comply with applicable Federal laws.Several commenters questioned EPA's conclusion. They maintained that theNHTSA regulations do not require the use of new tires on new motor vehiclesbut, rather, are performance standards which could be met equally wellby retread tires or new tires. EPA has reexamined this issue and reconfirmedthat the NHTSA requirements foreclose EPA from including original equipmenttires on new motor vehicles within the scope of the guideline. The NHTSA regulations require that new motor vehicles must meet eitherFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 109, ``New Pneumatic Tires_PassengerCars.'' or FMVSS No. 119, ``New Pneumatic Tires for Vehicles Other ThanPassenger Cars.'' Discussions with NHTSA verified EPA's earlier conclusionthat these standards require that new passenger vehicles be equipped withnew tires and do not allow the use of retread tires. It is NHTSA's positionthat manufacturers who supplied new motor vehicles with retread tires wouldbe in violation of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicles Safety Act of1966 and consequently subject to fines. RCRA section 6002(d)(1) requires Federal agencies with the responsibilityfor drafting ``specifications for procurement items'' to eliminate fromthe specifications any exclusion of recovered materials and any requirementthat items be manufactured from virgin material. A commenter has suggestedthat the NHTSA standards are discriminatory specifications prohibited bysection 6002(d). EPA, however, has determined that the NHTSA standardsare not procurement specifications. NHTSA promulgated its Federal MotorVehicle Safety Standards under express Congressional direction. Safety,not procurement, is the ``overriding consideration in the issuance of standards''under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. [SenateRep. No. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1966).]Certain commenters submitted evidence that some retread tires could meetthe NHTSA standards prescribed for new tires. EPA urges these commentersto petition NHTSA to revise its regulations so as to allow a manufacturerto equip new motor vehicles with qualifying retread tires. If the NHTSAstandards are revised, Federal agencies which write procurement specificationsmust then assure that these specifications meet the requirements of section6002(d) and do not exclude the procurement of motor vehicles equipped withretread tires. However, until NHTSA standards permit this, EPA will not,under section 6002(i), recommend to procuring agencies an affirmative procurementprogram which would direct them to revise their motor vehicles specificationsto require retread tires on new vehicles. Because the NHTSA standards ban the use of retread tires on new passengervehicles, it is unnecessary for EPA to exclude tires on new cars from theguideline. Moreover, in the event the NHTSA standards are changed so asto permit the use of retread tires on new motor vehicles, the exclusionwould be inappropriate. Therefore, andSection; 253.3(d)(1) of the proposedguideline has been deleted in the final guideline, and andSection; 253.2,Designation, no longer specifically excludes original equipment tires.3. <T3>Tires Manufactured With Recovered Rubber.</T3> A commenter stated thatthe guideline should apply to procurement of tires manufactured with recoveredrubber. EPA plans to study the feasibility of a procurement guideline forthis item and will consider issuing a separate guideline when the feasibilitystudy is completed.B. ApplicabilityMany of the requirements of section 6002 apply to ``procuring agencies,''which is defined by RCRA section 1004(17) as ``any Federal agency, or anyState agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is usingappropriated Federal funds for such procurement, or any person contractingwith any such agency with respect to work performed under such contract.''Under section 6002(a), the procurement requirements apply to any purchaseby a procuring agency of an item costing $10,000 or more or when the procuringagency purchased $10,000 worth of the item or of a functionally equivalentitem during the preceding fiscal year. Both direct and indirect purchasesare covered.1. <T3>Procuring Agencies. </T3>Commenters asked EPA to include in this guidelinethe discussion of the applicability of section 6002 to procuring agenciesthat was included in EPA's other procurement guidelines. EPA agrees thatthe discussion is germane to this guideline.The statutory definition of procuring agency identifies three types ofagencies: (1) Federal agencies, (2) State or local agencies using appropriatedFederal funds, and (3) contractors. Federal agencies should note that underthis definition, the requirements of section 6002 apply to them whetheror not <T3>appropriated </T3>Federal funds are used for procurement of items designatedby EPA. Section 253.3(a)(2) has been added to the final guideline to clarifythis point.In addition, the requirements of section 6002 apply to each Federal agencyas a whole; see andSection; 253.3(a)(2)(iii) of the final guideline. Thispoint is particularly important in determining whether the $10,000 thresholdhas been reached. For example, GSA, as a whole, purchases more than $10,000worth of tires during each fiscal year. Therefore, the requirements ofsection 6002 will apply to all of GSA's tire procurements, including procurementsby individual regional offices, even if a regional office procured lessthan $10,000 worth of tires.2. <T3>Direct Purchases. </T3>This guideline applies to tire purchases madedirectly by a procuring agency or by a government contractor for use ingovernment vehicles and equipment. Direct purchases by a contract wouldinclude purchases for maintaining a government fleet.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The term ``government fleet'' includes (1) vehicles ownedby a procuring agency and operated or maintained on behalf of the agencyby a contractor, (2) vehicles owned by a contractor or a third party andleased to or used by a procuring agency, and (3) vehicles owned by a contractorand used by the contractor with respect to work performed under contractto a procuring agency.A commenter suggested that EPA provide guidance, such as recommending useof ratios, to contractors who do work which is funded by commingled Federaland non-Federal funds. Nothing in section 6002 and its legislative historysuggests that Congress contemplated use of ratios to determine the applicabilityof section 6002 to procuring agencies, including contractors. In fact,Congress simply stated that the procurement requirements apply to any purchaseor acquisition. EPA further believes that the use of ratios would be unnecessarilyburdensome. EPA has concluded that determining the applicability of section6002 to a procuring agency in a given instance should be simple and direct.If a State or local procuring agency or a contractor is using Federal funds,even if such funds are commingled with non-Federal funds, then the requirementsof section 6002 apply. See andSection; 253.3(a)(2)(ii) of the final guideline.3. <T3>Indirect Purchases. </T3>The definition of ``procuring agency'' inRCRA section 1004(17) makes it clear that the requirements of section 6002apply to ``indirect purchases,'' i.e., purchases by a State or local agencyusing appropriated Federal funds or by contractors. Thus, the guidelineapplies to tire purchases meeting the $10,000 threshold made by Statesand their localities or their contractors, subcontractors, grantees, orother persons which are funded by grants, loans, or other forms of disbursementsof monies from Federal agencies.In the proposed guidelines, EPA stated that the guideline does not applyto tire purchases by State and local procuring agencies or contractorsif they are unrelated to or incidental to the Federal funding, i.e., notthe direct result of the grant, loan, or funds disbursement. Several commentersdisagreed with EPA's interpretation, noting that RCRA section 6002(a) statessimply that section 6002 applies to ``<T3>any </T3>purchase or acquisition of a procurement item'' (emphasisadded) when the $10,000 threshold is reached. These commenters raise anissue of general applicability to all the procurement guidelines. The Agencyplans further review and consideration of this issue and will publish detailedguidance on this subject within the near term. However, at this time, EPAis retaining the proposed language (in andSection; 253.3(c) of the finalguideline) which provided that the guideline did not apply to purchasesthat were not the direct result of a Federal grant, loan, or funds disbursement.EPA solicited comments on whether this guideline should exempt block grantsfrom the section 6002 procurement requirements or exempt block grants onlywhen it is not possible to account separately for such funds. A commentersuggested that EPA require all Federal grants to have specific line itemallocations for any item designated under section 6002(e) or that procuringagencies apply the ratio of Federal to non-Federal funding to each individualproduct category covered by a procurement guideline. EPA believes thatboth of these suggestions go beyond the scope of RCRA section 6002. Section6002(e) clearly gives EPA authority to recommend guidelines but not torequire compliance with them. As discussed above, nothing in section 6002and its legislative history suggest that Congress contemplated use of ratiosto determine the applicability of the procurement requirements to procuringagencies.Thus, EPA believes that the guidelines should apply whenever Federal monies,including block grants, are used, whether or not they are commingled withnon-Federal funds. In other words, if any Federal funds are used, thenthe requirements of section 6002 apply.4. <T3>The $10,000 Threshold. </T3>RCRA section 6002(a) provides that therequirements of section 6002 apply (1) when the purchase price of an itemexceeds $10,000 or (2) when the quantity of such items or of functionallyequivalent items purchased during the preceding fiscal year was $10,000or more. Section 253.3(a)(1) of the guideline provides that procuring agencies<T3>should </T3>consider all sizes and types of tires to be functionallyequivalent items. Thus, when determining if the $10,000 threshold has beenreached, procuring agencies should tally the cost of all tires purchased,rather than each size or category of tire (e.g., truck tires, automobiletires) purchased. EPA believes that restricting the applicability of section6002 based upon a narrow, technical definition of functional equivalencywould limit the effectiveness of the guideline in meeting the objectivesof RCRA, because an agency may purchase less than $10,000 of each sizeor category of tire. EPA recommended a similar approach in the guidelinefor procurement of lubricating oil containing re-refined oil, 53 FR 24705(June 30, 1988). A commenter stated that EPA should <T3>require </T3>procuring agencies to consider all sizes and types oftires to be functionally equivalent, noting that it is EPA's job to fleshout the statutory requirements. While EPA agrees that it has the authorityto flesh out the statutory requirements, such authority is found in RCRAsection 6002(e)(2), which provides that EPA guidelines shall ``set forth<T3>recommended </T3>practices'' (emphasis added). The commenter has failedto cite any statutory provision which empowers EPA to require a given practice.In addition, the commenter is incorrect in stating that EPA's final paperand lubricating oils guidelines <T3>required </T3>a procuring agency to consider its paper or lubricatingoil purchases as functionally equivalent for purposes of determining theguidelines' applicability; both guidelines state that specified items should,not must, be considered to be functionally equivalent. (See 53 FR 23551,June 22, 1988, and 53 FR 24705, June 30, 1988.) EPA noted in the preamble to the lubricating oil procurement guidelinethat while RCRA section 6002(a) provides that Section 6002 and EPA guidelinesapply whenever a procuring agency purchases $10,000 or more worth of anitem in the course of the preceding fiscal year, it does not provide thatthe procurement requirements are triggered when the quantity of items purchased<T3>during the current fiscal year </T3>is $10,000 or more (emphasis added)(53 FR 24705, June 30, 1988). In other words, Congress did not intend torequire procuring agencies to keep a running tally during the current yearof procurements of items designated by EPA. Section 6002 clearly sets outa two-step procedure for determining whether the $10,000 threshold hasbeen reached. First, a procuring agency must determine whether it purchased$10,000 worth of an item or of functionally equivalent items during thepreceding fiscal year. Second, if a procuring agency did not procure $10,000worth of an item during the preceding fiscal year, it is not subject tosection 6002 unless it makes a $10,000 purchase of the item in the currentfiscal year. The requirements of section 6002 then apply to the $10,000purchase of the item; to all subsequent purchases of the item made duringthe current fiscal year, regardless of size; and to all procurements ofthe item made in the following fiscal year (<T3>Ibid</T3>.). However, it has been brought to EPA's attention that the regulation portionof the lubricating oil, paper, and retread tires procurement guidelinedo not reflect this interpretation. EPA has corrected andSection; 253.3(a)(1)in the final guideline issued today and will be issuing corrections tothe lubricating oil and paper guidelines to remove any ambiguity on thisissue. Finally, EPA notes that the FAR contains a $25,000 small procurement provision,48 CFR Part 13. This provision should not be confused with the $10,000threshold because their purposes are different. The $10,000 threshold determineswhen the affirmative procurement provisions of RCRA section 6002 apply,whereas the $25,000 threshold triggers small procurement procedures. Procuringagencies must use the $10,000 threshold when determining the applicabilityof RCRA section 6002 and the final guideline issued today. C. DefinitionsNo comments were received on the proposed definitions, and EPA is issuingthem as proposed. D. Requirements vs. Recommendations RCRA section 6002 requires procuring agencies and contracting officersto perform certain activities, such as revising specifications for procurementitems. It also requires EPA to prepare ``guidelines for the use of procuringagencies in complying with'' section 6002. EPA has incorporated the section6002 requirements into the guidelines for the benefit of procuring agencies.As a result, the guidelines contain two types of provisions: Requirements(mandated by Congress in section 6002) and recommendations (EPA's guidancefor complying with the requirements of section 6002). As used in this guideline,the verbs ``shall'' and ``must'' indicate section 6002 requirements, whileverbs such as ``recommend,'' ``should,'' and ``suggest'' indicate recommendationsfor complying with those requirements. Procuring agencies are required to comply with the requirements of section6002, whereas EPA's recommendations for meeting those statutory requirementsare advisory in nature. Procuring agencies may choose to use other approacheswhich satisfy the section 6002 requirements. However, EPA believes thatif a procuring agency chooses to follow EPA's recommendations, that agencywill be in compliance with the section 6002 requirements. E. Specifications 1. <T3>Federal Agencies. </T3>RCRA section 6002(d) contains two requirementsfor revising specifications for procurement items. As discussed above,Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewingspecifications for procurement items procured by Federal agencies wererequired to revise their specifications by May 8, 1986, to eliminate exclusionsof recovered materials and requirements that items be manufactured fromvirgin materials [section 6002(d)(1)].\4\<NOTE/> Second, within one year after the date of publication ofa guideline as a final rule, Federal agencies must assure that their specificationsrequire the use of recovered materials to the maximum extent possible withoutjeopardizing the intended end use of the item [section 6002(d)(2)]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In the case of tires, specifications must not requirethat only virgin rubber can be used nor must they specify that reclaimedrubber cannot be used. Section 253.10 of the guideline contains these requirements as they applyto retread tires. Section 253.21(a) provides that by May 8, 1986, Federalagencies were required to eliminate from their specifications exclusionsof retread tires and any requirement that tires be manufactured from virginmaterials. Section 253.10(b) provides that agencies must assure that theirspecifications require the use of retread tires to the maximum extent possiblewithout jeopardizing the intended end use of the item. In addition, inresponse to coments, EPA has added to andSection; 253.10(b) a recommendationthat specifications indicate the functional requirements of tires to beprocured, including the performance criteria, any desired mileage guarantees,and the size and type of tire required. By identifying functional requirements,rather than limiting the applicability of a specification to new tiresor to retread tires, such specifications will allow retread tires and newtires to compete on an equitable basis. EPA believes that the second specification requirement in RCRA section6002(d) is more extensive than the first requirements. Simply eliminatingdiscriminatory provisions, as required by section 6002(d)(1), is not sufficientto meet all of the obligations of section 6002(d). EPA believes, however,that compliance with the affirmative procurement requirements of section6002(i), coupled with use of specifications identifying functional requirements,will fulfill the section 6002(d)(2) requirements because an affirmativeprocurement program should result in procurement to the maximum extentpracticable. EPA has not reviewed all of the new tire specifications used by Federalprocuring agencies. EPA believes that the ones that it has reviewed violateRCRA section 6002 because they exclude retread tires. Specifically, EPAbelieves that GSA would be required to revise its specifications for newtires so that they apply both to new tires and to retread tires. Theremay be other specifications of which EPA is unaware that do not violatesection 6002; it is the responsibility of the procuring agencies that preparethese specifications to review them and to determine whether they are incompliance with RCRA. 2. <T3>Procuring Agencies. </T3>EPA believes that the second specificationrevision requirement also applies to non-Federal procuring agencies whichprocure tires with appropriated Federal funds. Unless their specificationsare revised to require the use of retread tires, these agencies will beunable to implement the affirmative procurement requirements of RCRA section6002(c)(1) and (i). For this reason, andSection; 253.10(b) of the guidelineprovides that all <T3>procuring agencies </T3>(rather than ``Federal agencies'' as providedin the Act) must assure that their specifications require the use of retreadtires to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intendeduse of the item. 3. <T3>Public Comments on the Proposed Specifications Provisions. </T3>Commentersprimarily discussed whether EPA should recommend specification revisions,whether NHTSA regulations precluded development of specifications for certainuses of retread tires, and whether one specification could be developedfor new and retread tires. EPA also received miscellaneous comments pertainingto the specifications portion of the proposed guideline. a. <T3>EPA recommendations for specification revisions. </T3>A commenter didnot agree that EPA should be recommending specification revisions to GSA,stating that EPA should only specify the end result and leave the methodof achieving this result to the procuring agencies. EPA disagrees. EPAis required by statute to ``set forth recommended practices with respectto the procurement of recovered materials'' (section 6002(e)(2) of RCRA).EPA thus believes that Congress intended for EPA to do more than merelyreiterate the content of the statute, including suggesting specificationrevisions, as appropriate. b. <T3>Impact of NHTSA regulations.</T3> The GSA Interagency Fleet ManagementSystem has strongly urged EPA to ``advise Federal agencies that retreadtires are not required by NHTSA to meet the standards for tire enduranceor high-speed performance. This will ensure that Federal agencies haverelevant information available to them in designing their procurement program.''In addition, a commenter has strongly urged EPA to reconsider making theguideline apply to passenger carrying vehicles or steering axles of othervehicles engaged in high-speed, over-the-road operations, in light of thefact that NHTSA does not require retread tires to meet tire endurance orhigh-speed performance requirements which apply to new tires.EPA concurs that tires which do not meet standards for endurance or high-speedperformance should not be used for those purposes. EPA notes, however,that GSA has not provided any documentation showing that retread tires<T3>cannot</T3> meet these performance standards, and RCRA section 6002(d)(2)requires agencies to assure that specifications require the sue of recoveredmaterials to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intendedend use of the item. EPA therefore urges procurement agencies to developstandards, in conjunction with GSA and the retreading industry, that canbe used to test the endurance and high-speed performance capabilities ofretread tires. The NHTSA standard for new tires, 49 CFR 571.109, couldserve as a starting point. EPA is aware that at least one retreader hassuccessfully tested its tires in accordance with the new tire enduranceand high-speed performance standards in andSection; 571.109, so it is possiblethat these performance standards either can be used for retread tires orcan be adapted for retread tire use. Furthermore, EPA knows of no NHTSAregulation which prohibits procuring agencies from doing so.A commenter suggested that the absence of NHTSA standards for a particularend use (e.g., high speed retread tires) precludes that use. On the contrary,EPA believes that the absence of a NHTSA standard for a particular usecannot be used by a procuring agency as a reason for not developing itsown specifications for that use. Specification revision or specificationdevelopment must be in accordance with RCRA section 6002(d)(2). In otherwords, a determination that use of recovered materials (e.g., retread tires)will jeopardize the intended end use (e.g., high speed) should be supportedby test data.c. <T3>Use of a single specification for new and retread tires.</T3> A commenterstated the belief that retread tires and new tires are two different productsrequiring two different specifications. EPA believes that one performancestandard identifying the properties and/or performance requirements oftires can and should be developed. It is not necessary that one specificationbe developed, however, as long as the performance standard in each specificationis the same. The issue of concern is that there be one performance standardagainst which both new and retread tires can compete on an equitable basis.For example, at least one major American retailer uses the same performancerequirements for retread tires as for new tires. The tires also are soldwith the same warranties as new tires. Thus, as discussed above, EPA isrecommending in andSection; 253.21(b) of the final guideline that specificationsidentify the functional requirements of tires to be procured.d. <T3>Miscellaneous comments.</T3> Section 253.10(a) of the guideline statesthat Federal agencies were required to eliminate any exclusion of retreadtires from their specifications by May 8, 1986. A commenter objected toEPA's use of ``retread tires'' rather than ``recovered materials'' as usedin RCRA section 6002(d)(1). One purpose of EPA guidelines is to informprocuring agencies as to what the law requires them to do. In the caseof tires, the law requires them to eliminate exclusions of products manufacturedwith recovered materials, including retread tires; therefore, it is appropriatefor EPA to use the term ``retread tires.''Section 253.10(b) of the guideline provides that procuring agencies mustrevise their specifications to require the use of retread tires to themaximum extent possible ``without jeopardizing the intended end use ofthese items,'' which is the limitation on use permitted by RCRA section6002(d)(2). A commenter stated that by using the statutory language, EPAis implying that there may be problems with retread tires. EPA is implyingnothing about the performance of retread tires; instead, EPA is informingprocuring agencies that they may restrict use of retread tires if suchuse will jeopardize the intended end use of the tires. (Exclusions of retreadtires are discussed further below.)A commenter stated that a procuring agency is not free merely to cite itsown specifications as a reason, under RCRA section 6002(c)(1), for failingto buy retread tires <T3>unless</T3> the specifications have been revised to require the useof retread tires to the maximum extent practicable. EPA agrees. Procuringagencies may not continue to use discriminatory specifications when purchasingtires, nor may they cite such discriminatory specifications as the basisfor their failure to purchase retread tires, unless and until the basisfor the restrictive provisions in such specifications has been reviewedand found to be justified. In the final guideline issued today, EPA hasrevised andSection; 253.21(d)(3) accordingly.4. <T3>Sources of Specifications.</T3> The retreading industry has developedstandards which can be obtained by contacting the industry trade associations.The addresses and telephone numbers of the associations are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">American Retreaders Association, Inc., P.O. Box 17203, Louisville,KY 40217, (502) 361-9219.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Tire Dealers and Retreaders Association, Inc., Suite 400,1250 I Street NW., Washington, DC 20005, (202) 789-2300. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Tread Rubber Manufacturers' Group, 1200 19th Street NW., Washington,DC 20036, (404) 546-0221. </ITAG>The American Retreaders' Association, Inc. has prepared a booklet on bidspecifications, <T3>How to prepare bid specifications for retread and repaired tires, </T3>whichoutlines in some detail major areas that should be considered when preparingbid specifications. A copy of the booklet has been placed in the docketfor this guideline and is available from the ARA. 5. <T3>Exclusions.</T3> Under section 6002(d)(2) of RCRA, specifications neednot be revised if the agency determines that, for technical reasons, aproduct containing recovered materials will jeopardize the end use of theproduct. EPA recommends that such determinations be documented, be basedon technical performance information, and identify any performance criteriathat cannot be satisfied by retread tires. (See andSection; 253.11 of theguideline.) If the agency subsequently issues a restrictive specification,the basis for the restriction should be documented when the specificationis issued. Although RCRA section 6002(d)(2) permits an agency to limit the use ofan item containing recovered materials, there must be a legitimate, factualbasis for such limitation. Use cannot be limited without reason or basedsimply on prejudice, whim, or speculation. For this reason, andSection; 253.11of the final guideline provides that procuring agencies should documentthe basis for any limitations. In the proposed guideline, EPA provided the following example of a specificationthat would satisfy RCRA section 6002(d)2): Draft Army Regulation (AR) 750-36,which contains the Army's policy and procedures for use of retread tires,excludes use of retread tires on the front wheels of buses and on emergencyvehicles and heavy-lift vehicles.\5\<NOTE/> Commenters objected to the restrictions in this regulationfor a variety of reasons. EPA was not endorsing this regulation. Rather,EPA's purpose in citing it was to provide an example of the type of specificationthat would conform to RCRA section 6002(d)(2) if and only if there is ajustificable basis for such limitations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Army has informed EPA that Draft AR 750-36 was notissued. Retread tires are now included in AR 750-1 which, among other things,identifies limitations on use of retreads. EPA believes that the basisfor these limitations should be documented. F. Affirmative ProcurementProgramRCRA section 6002(i) requires procuring agencies to adopt an affirmativeprocurement program to ensure that retread tires are purchased to the maximumextent practicable. The program must contain four elements: (1) A recoveredmaterials preference program; (2) a promotion program; (3) procedures forestimation, certification, and verification of recovered materials content;and (4) procedures for annual review and monitoring of the program's effectiveness.The program must be established within one year of the date of publicationof this guideline as a final rule. Federal procuring agencies should note that while GSA executes tire contracts,it is not responsible for actual procurement by other agencies and thereforeis not responsible for development and implementation of affirmative procurementprograms under RCRA section 6002 for any agency other than itself. Individualprocuring agencies must develop, implement, and monitor their own affirmativeprocurement programs. EPA has added andSection; 253.20(b) to the final guidelineto make this clear. The following sections explain EPA's recommendations for each element ofan affirmative procurement program for retread tires. 1. <T3>Recovered Materials Preference Program. </T3> Under section 6002(i)(3),procuring agencies have three options for implementing the preference program.They can employ a case-by-case approach, adopt minimum content standards,or choose an approach that is substantially equivalent to the precedingapproaches. In general, the minimum content standard approach is appropriatewhen the quantity of recovered material used can vary. For example, thequantity of recycled paper used in manufacturing paper and paper productscan be varied. In the case of retread tires, where the recovered materialis the used tire casing, the quantity of recovered material used does notvary. For this reason, minimum content standards are inapplicable to retreadtire procurement. a. <T3>Proposed recommendations for a preference program</T3>. In the proposedguideline, EPA recommended two approaches to procurement of retread tires:procurement of tire retreading services and procurement of retread tiresas a product. EPA recommended that agencies procuring retreading servicesrecord specified information for each procurement of new tires and eachprocurement of retreading services. This information would be reviewedas part of the statutorily mandated annual review and would be used toidentify unjustifiable resistance to use of tire retreading contracts.EPA further recommended that agencies procuring retread tires as a productuse case-by-case procurement through open competition between vendors ofretread tires and vendors of new tires. In the case of a tie bid, all otherfactors being equal, preference would be given to the vendor of retreadtires.After reviewing the public comments on the proposed guideline and furtherresearching state and commercial tire procurement, EPA has concluded thatprocuring agencies should use a combination of the two recommended approaches.For example, a commenter stated that use of retreading services, by itself,does not satisfy an agency's obligations under section 6002 to procureretread tires to the maximum extent practicable because only a portionof an agency's tires can be retreaded and the agency will, therefore, berequired to procure some replacement tires, which could be retread tires.EPA agrees. Agencies should procure retreading services for their usedcarcasses <T3>and</T3> procure retread tires as a product.EPA recognizes, however, that it might not always be practical or possiblefor a procuring agency to purchase retread tires or retreading servicesin all cases. As described below, the final guideline also addresses procurementusing one but not both components in such cases.b. <T3>Final recommendations for a preference program.</T3> EPA recommendsthat procuring agencies establish preference programs consisting of twocomponents: (1) Procurement of retreading services for the agencies' usedcarcasses and (2) procurement of retread tires as a product. In addition,EPA recommends that procuring agencies establish a tire procurement policythat gives priority to retreading the agencies' used tires. In other words,under the policy, a procuring agency will first procure tire retreadingservices to the maximum extent practicable. If retreading services arenot practicable, for example because the tire carcass is not retreadable,then the procuring agency will obtain a replacement tire from the productvendor.If a procuring agency finds that it is unable to implement one of thesecomponents, then it must document the basis for this and continue to implementthe other component. The basis for not implementing one of the componentsmust be one of the reasons provided in RCRA section 6002(c)_i.e., unsatisfactorycompetition, unreasonable availability, failure to meet performance standardsor specifications, or unreasonable price. In addition, the procuring agencymust continue to attempt to implement the component that it is unable toimplement at this time.As explained in section II.E.2 of this preamble, procuring agencies purchasingretread tires as products can solicit bids from both vendors of new tiresand vendors of retread tires. The decision to purchase retread tires ismade on a case-by-case basis, and the contract is awarded to the lowest-pricedresponsible bidder. EPA recommends that this component of the preferenceprogram include a preference to the vendor offering to supply the greatestnumber of retread tires in the event that tie bids are submitted by a vendorof retread tires and a vendor of new tires, all other factors being equal.Section 253.21(a)(2) of the final guideline recommends that procuring agenciesadopt such a preference.A commenter stated that the proposed tie bid provision was ambiguous inlight of the equal low bids provision of FAR 14.407-6 and requested clarification.It is EPA's view that RCRA section 6002 did not authorize procuring agencies,in their preference programs, to supersede applicable provisions of Federalprocurement law, including the FAR. EPA believes, however, that the recoveredmaterials preference authorized by RCRA section 6002 should be incorporatedinto the preferences established in the equal low bids provision of theFAR. Therefore, EPA recommends that Federal entities responsible for periodicrevision of the FAR consider modifying the provision at 48 CFR 14.407-6to integrate a preference for vendors offering to provide procurement itemswhich have been designated by EPA under RCRA section 6002(e).In the final paper and lubricating oil guidelines, EPA noted that it believedthat a case-by-case program might not satisfy the section 6002(i) requirementfor an affirmative procurement program because it would only award contractsto the product containing a higher percentage of recovered materials inthe event of a tie. [See 52 FR 37299, 27302 (October 6, 1987), and 52 FR38844 (October 19, 1987).] In light of these previous statements by EPA,several commenters objected to EPA's recommendation to use the case-by-caseapproach for procuring tires as products because it would have little orno effect on the procurement of retread tires.EPA has concluded that the case-by-case approach can be used successfullyto procure retread tires and should be used as one component of a preferenceprogram. As long as retread tires provide similar service to new tires_aspromoters of their use, including the commenters, maintain that they will_ata lower cost, procuring agencies must procure them.Because RCRA section 6002(i) requires the procurement program to be affirmative,and because procuring agencies must promote their programs, agencies usingthe case-by-case approach are required to seek out vendors of retread tires.Clearly, this will be a change in the status quo, in which most procuringagencies neither consider using retread tires nor seek out vendors of retreadtires. As a result, the case-by-case approach can have a significant impacton retread tire procurement.A commenter stated that it is not feasible to allow a retread tire to bebid against a new tire because of cost and requirement differences, althoughthe commenter failed to explain how and why this is true. In fact, EPAbelieves that requirements can be the same for new and retread tires, anexample being the use of mileage guarantees. In addition, EPA notes thatone of the purposes of RCRA Section 6002 and procurement guidelines isto require procuring agencies to treat products made from virgin materialsand products made from recovered materials in the same manner to the extentconsistent with the intended end use. EPA believes that it is possibleto meet this goal by developing an affirmative procurement program thattreats new and retread tires alike even while acknowledging that thereare differences between them. Therefore, EPA has retained the case-by-caserecommendation in the final guideline. A commenter suggested that EPA revise the preference program provisionto recommend that a procuring agency show that its procurement satisfiesthe statutory requirements, including use of non-discriminatory specifications.In response, EPA is adding andSection; 253.21(c) to the final guideline torecommend that procuring agencies document which of the statutory limitationsis the reason for not procuring retreading services.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ As discussed above in section III.E. of the preamble,a procuring agency cannot cite its specifications as a reason for failingto procure retreads unless the specifications have been reviewed and revisedin accordance with RCRA section 6002(d) and Subpart B of the guideline.While GSA prepares tire specifications and awards contracts to tire vendors,the individual Federal operator, in conjunction with GSA's Fleet Management,decides whether to purchase retreading services or to buy a new tire. Exceptfor Department of Defense activities, the agencies do not maintain recordson procurement of new tires or tire retreading services. EPA believes thatrecordkeeping is necessary to obtain information on cost savings, performanceof retread tires, and use of retread tire or tire retreading services contracts.Therefore, EPA recommends that as part of the preference program, agenciesinstitute the practice of monitoring tire procurement by agency subgroupsor individuals by requiring them to record their decisions to procure replacementtires and tire retreading services. The record should identify the typeand quantity of tires procured; whether new tires, retread tires, or retreadingservices were procured; the cost per tire; and if new tires are procured,the reasons for not procuring retreading services or retread tires. Thisrecommendation is in andSection; 253.21(d) of the final guideline.A commenter objected to the proposed recordkeeping recommendation on thegrounds that it would mean two separate actions for every tire purchase,would increase the administrative workload, and would be very difficultto control or manage. EPA disagrees. First, when a replacement tire isneeded, a decision is made whether to procure a new tire or retreadingservices; EPA's recommendation simply is that the decision be documentedso that procurement can be reviewed annually as required by section 6002.Second, because the recommended documentation is minimal, EPA does notbelieve that the administrative workload will be more than minimal, northat it will be very difficult to control or manage. EPA also notes thatthe affirmative procurement provisions of RCRA section 6002 clearly envisionat least some increases in the administrative workload; for example, administrativeeffort is needed in order to implement the estimation, certification, verification,and annual review requirements.Very few Federal agencies operate central motor pools, and the civilianagencies no longer store replacement automotive parts, including tires,in warehouses. Instead, vehicle maintenance and replacement parts are purchasedfrom commercial establishments on an as needed basis. GSA contracts withvendors to provide parts and services. A commenter stated that in lightof this lack of central motor pools, it would be impossible for most agenciesto obtain tire retreading services.EPA believes that procurement of retreading services is possible withoutgovernment warehousing. For example, GSA can require that contract retreadersstore used government tires until there is a predetermined, economicallyfeasible quantity to be retreaded.\7\<NOTE/> The retreader can also store the retreaded government tiresand provide them to the government vehicle operator on an as-needed basis.Some retreaders operate wholesale or retail outlets for tires in additionto their retreading operations and thus might be willing to enter intosuch warehousing arrangements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Current GSA contracts require agencies to submit a batchof 200 tires for retreading. This quantity can be reduced, however. EPAknows of a State that supplies batches of 25 tires for retreading. c. <T3>Other preference program recommendations. </T3>A commenter indicatedto EPA that GSA's use of small business procurement procedures for procurementof tire retreading services contributes to quality assurance problems.EPA believes that such procurement practices constitute specificationsand must be reviewed and revised by procuring agencies, as necessary. EPApreviously stated in the lubricating oils guideline that the term ``specifications''in RCRA section 6002(d) refers to all procurement practices related tospecifying what a procuring agency intends to purchase, 53 FR 24710 (June30, 1988). Therefore, as part of developing a lubricating oil procurementprogram under section 6002(i), procuring agencies were required to examinetheir procurement practices and revise those which inhibit or precludeprocurement of products containing recovered materials. EPA believes thatthis is equally applicable to procurement of retread tires. EPA, therefore,has added andSection; 253.21(e) to the final guideline to inform procuringagencies that they must review and revise any procurement practices whichinhibit or preclude procurement of retread tires or tire retreading services.The Federal (i.e., GSA) approach to using retread tires employs a combinationof (1) a retreading facilities specification describing the proceduresto be used for retreading and (2) policies limiting the use of retreadtires. GSA's written policies recommend that retread tires not be usedon the steering axles of high speed, over-the-road vehicles and prohibituse of retreads on passenger-carrying vehicles or on the steering axleof any Interagency Fleet Management vehicle used on public highways. Useof retread tires is recommended on the rear wheels of large traucks, trucktractors, trailers, and off-road vehicles.Commenters stated that there are no means at GSA's disposal to assure thequality of retread tires. According to the commenters, barriers to qualityassurance include the standard operating procedures of the retreading industry,lack of government and/or industry test methods, and infeasibility of usingbatch testing on retread tires. The commenters also stated that these factorsprecluded development of one specification to be used for both new andretread tires. EPA discussions with the retreading industry and tire retailers have uncoveredretreading programs that employ both production quality control and performancequality control. The performance quality control involves performance testingthat is the same as or similar to testing required by government specificationsfor new tires. Batch testing using random sampling also is used. Thesemanufacturers produce passenger car tires which are intended to be soldfor the same usage as new tires (e.g., there are no limitations on theiruse on steering axles or at highway speeds). Regular, high performance,and speed-rated tires are produced. At least one major American retailersells these tires with the same warranties as new tires. In light of theseprograms, EPA has concluded that it is possible for GSA to develop specificationsand procurement practices that assure tire quality.\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The basis for EPA's conclusion is described in <T3>Background Document for Final Retread Tires Procurement Guideline </T3>(E.H.Pechan andamp; Associates, Inc., September 1988), which has been placed inthe docket for this rulemaking. In this regard, a commenter stated that the Federal government is encumberedby a myriad of Federal statutes and a variety of Federal Procurement Regulationswhich preclude procurement of high quality retread tires. EPA points outthat one of the underlying purposes of section 6002 is to require procuringagencies to revise their procedures so that they can procure items containingrecovered materials. d. <T3>Other procurement approaches considered. </T3>In the final paper guideline,52 FR 37298-37299 (October 6, 1987), EPA discussed the section 6002(i)requirement that any affirmative procurement program be consistent withapplicable provisions of Federal procurement law. From time to time, Congresshas established preferential procurement programs in order to attain socioeconomicgoals. Among those are the Small Business, Labor Surplus Area, and MinorityBusiness procurement programs. EPA considered applying either or both ofthe mechanisms used in those programs_price preferences and set-asides_tothis guideline. A price preference allows the procuring agency to pay ahigher price, if necessary, for a specified product from preferred vendors.A set-aside requires the procuring agency to award a certain percentageof its contracts to preferred vendors of a product regardless of price.Price preferences and setasides are currently being used in some stateprograms for the procurement of paper and paper products containing recoveredmaterials. As of January 1988, five states and two cities use price preferenceprograms in which products containing recovered materials may cost from5 to 10 percent more than virgin materials. Two states have set-aside programs,one for paper and paper products, the other for all types of products.These states report that they successfully procure products containingrecovered materials. EPA has considered recommending these programs at the Federal level. However,in the case of existing Federal preferential procurement programs thatallow a price preference or set-aside, the Agency found that each had beenestablished under explicit statutory authority or a specific ExecutiveOrder. Neither the statutory language nor the legislative history of Section6002 seems to contemplate the adoption of either price preferences or set-asides,and doing so would conflict with existing Federal procurement law. Therefore,rather than recommending price preferences or set-asides, EPA is recommendingthat procuring agencies use the procurement mechanisms provided in RCRAsection 6002(i)(3). 2. <T3>Promotion Program. </T3>The second requirement of the affirmative procurementprogram is a promotional effort by procuring agencies. The guideline recommendsseveral methods for procuring agencies to use for disseminating informationabout their preference programs, such as placing statements in invitationsto bid, discussing the program at bidders' conferences, and informing industrytrade associations about the program. No commenters suggested revisionsto this section of the guideline. 3. <T3>Estimates, Certification, and Verification. </T3>The third requirementof the affirmative procurement program set forth in section 6002(i) concernsestimates, certification, and verification. Many questions have been raisedabout the certification and estimation of recovered material content, suchas when they should be provided, who is to provide them, how the informationis to be obtained, and how it is to be verified. To clarify this subject,it is necessary to review the requirements of the law. a. <T3>Estimation. </T3>RCRA sections 6002(c)(3)(B) and 6002(i)(2)(C) requirethat after the effective date of an EPA guideline, contracting officersmust require vendors who supply Federal procuring agencies with items coveredby the guideline to provide an estimate of the total percentage of recoveredmaterials contained in the items. EPA believes that this requirement isfor the purpose of gathering statistical information on price, recoveredmaterial content, and availability, and applies regardless of whether theprocurement solicitation specifies that recovered materials can or mustbe used. In the case of tires, procuring agencies either purchase a product containingrecovered tire casings, or contract for a retreading service for governmentcasings, rather than purchasing a product containing a certain percentageof recovered materials. In the proposed guideline, EPA stated that thestatistical information that procuring agencies need to obtain the numberof retread tires to be a supplied by the vendor. A commenter pointed out,however, that when a procuring agency purchases tire retreading servicesusing an indefinite quantity contract, it would be impossible for the vendorto for the vendor to estimate the quantity of tires to be supplied. EPAagrees and has concluded that the estimation provision does not apply inthis limited situation. EPA has revised andSection; 253.23(a) accordingly.For all other procurements of retreat tires or tire retreading services,however, the contracting officer must require the vendor to estimate thenumber of retreat tires to be supplied.b. <T3>Certification. </T3>RCRA section 6002(i)(2)(C) provides that contractingofficers must require vendors to supply certifications of recovered materialscontent, where appropriate. EPA believes that, in general, <T3>written </T3>certifications are inappropriate for retread tire procurementbecause retreaders already use another certification procedure which isrequired by Department of Transportation regulations. Newly retreaded tiresare inspected to determine that they are free of defects and that theycomply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Tires passing the retreaders'inspection are certified by stamping the retreading plant's identificationnumber and the symbol DOT-R on the sidewall. The identification numberindicates that the plant is a retreading operation. This is in accordancewith section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of1966 and 49 CFR 571.117 and 574.5. EPA recognizes, however, that vendors offering tires as a product mightoffer to supply a set number of retread tires or to supply retread tiresas a set percentage of the total number of tires to be supplied. In thisinstance, a certification of the quantity or percentage to be suppliedis needed. Therefore, EPA has added a certification recommendation in thefinal guideline; see andSection;253.23(b). A commenter stated that vendors should be required to supply the certificationnumber (i.e., the retreader's DOT identification number) on their bidsas a means of meeting the certification requirement. EPA disagrees, becausethe relevant information needed by a procuring agency is the quantity oftires to be supplied, and the DOT identification number will not providethis information. Therefore, EPA has not included the commenter's recommendedrevision in the final guideline. c. <T3>Verification. </T3>Section 6002(i) also requires procuring agenciesto establish reasonable procedures to verify the estimates and certification.For retread tires, verification will be relatively easy because the certificationnumber stamped on the sidewall of the tire identifies the tire as a retread.Procuring agencies need only to spot check these numbers to verify thata retread tire has been supplied. 4. <T3>Annual Review and Monitoring. </T3>The fourth requirement of the affirmativeprocurement program is an annual review and monitoring of the effectivenessof the program. EPA recommends that the review include an estimate of thenumber of retread tires purchased during the year, assessment of the effectivenessof the agency preference program, and an assessment of remaining barriersto procurement of retread tires. In other procurement guidelines, EPA has recommended that procuring agencieskeep specified records in order to monitor the progress of their affirmativeprocurement programs. Through an inadvertent oversight, EPA failed to includethis recommendation in the proposed retread tires guideline. Several commentersasked EPA to include the recordkeeping recommendations. EPA agrees thatthis provision should be added to the retread tires guideline. EPA notesthat the recommendations were available for public comment during developmentof the final paper and lubricating oil guideline and the proposed buildinginsulation products guideline. See 52 FR 37335, October 6, 1987; 52 FR38838, October 19, 1987; and 53 FR 29185, August 2, 1988. Therefore, inthe final guideline issued today, EPA has revised andSection;253.24 to incorporatethe recordkeeping recommendations. The following discussion explains therecommendations. EPA has concluded that one purpose of the requirement that vendors provideestimates is to provide information to procuring agencies that can be usedin future procurements. Further, procuring agencies need to keep up-to-dateon changes in recycling practices and availability of products containingrecovered materials. EPA believes that unless a procuring agency compilessuch data, it will not be fulfilling its statutory obligations. A program for gathering statistics need not be elaborate to be effective.However, agencies should monitor their procurements to compile data onthe following: (a) Comparative price information on competitive procurements; (b) The quantity of each item procured over a fiscal year; (c) The availability of retread tires or tire retreading services to procuringagencies; (d) Type of performance tests conducted, together with the categories ofretread tires that failed the tests, the percentage of all new tires andretread tires procured, respectively, that failed each test, and the natureof the failure; (e) Agency experience with the performance of the procured products.EPA recommends that each procuring agency prepare a report on its annualreview and monitoring of the effectiveness of its procurement program.As part of the report, agencies should demonstrate that their preferenceprogram results in procurement of retread tires or tire retreading servicesto the maximum extent practicable. The basis for these determinations shouldbe a review of the data compiled on price, availability, and performance,as well as a comparison of estimates and certifications provided by thevendors. Agencies should also document specification revisions made duringthe reporting period.EPA believes that this information will be useful to the public. EPA notesthat this guideline will apply to State and local procuring agencies andcontractors, as explained in Section III.B of the preamble. Informationdrawn from the experience of Federal procuring agencies about purchasesof retread tires and tire retreading services would therefore be usefulto State and local purchasing officials and contractors. Accordingly, EPAencourages Federal procuring agencies to make their reports available tothe public.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Of course, reports generated by Federal agencies are availableto the public through the Freedom of Information Act. EPA believes thatFederal agencies should take affirmative steps to make the reports readilyavailable, such as making the reports available for purchase from the GovernmentPrinting Office or the National Technical Information Service.Finally, EPA notes that while the annual review and monitoring requirementsof RCRA Section 6002 apply to State and local procuring agencies and tocontractors, EPA's recommendation for recordkeeping and reporting is lesspertinent for these persons than for Federal agencies. Most EPA recommendationsare germane to implementing section 6002. In the case of the recordkeepingand reporting recommendations, however, the recommendations are more germaneto the Federal agencies, which are required to report to the Office ofFederal Procurement Policy regarding implementation of section 6002. Inaddition, reports generated by the Federal agencies are available to thepublic through Freedom of Information Act requests, and the experienceof Federal agencies will serve as an important teaching tool for non-Federalagencies trying to implement affirmative procurement programs.In the case of non-Federal procuring agencies and contractors, there isno reporting requirement in section 6002, and the Freedom of InformationAct does not extend to their documents (although there might be a similarstate provision). EPA believes that reporting is less relevant when thereport is unavailable unless the agency or contractor chooses to make itavailable. Therefore, EPA continues to recommend recordkeeping and reportingbut acknowledges that these recommendations do not apply equally to non-Federalagencies and contractors.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Price, Competition, Availability, and Performance</ITAG>Section 6002(c)(1) of RCRA provides that a procuring agency may decidenot to purchase an item designated by EPA if it determines that (1) theitem is available only at an unreasonable price, (2) a satisfactory levelof competition cannot be maintained, (3) the item is not reasonably availablewithin a reasonable period of time, or (4) the item fails to meet the applicablespecifications. This portion of the preamble discusses the effect of theselimitations on retread tire procurement.Commenters asked EPA to compile information on availability, price (includingrelative price of retread tires by geographic regions), and performanceof retread tires and to distribute this information to all Federal agenciesthat purchase tires and to every state. They also asked EPA to sponsorseminars to share this information with interested persons. EPA agreesthat further guidance will need to be provided to procuring agencies andvendors regarding the implementation of this as well as the other procurementguidelines. Therefore, the Agency will be developing a plan for educatingthe various procuring agencies and vendors.A commenter objected to EPA's placing information on availability, price,and performance of retread tires in the docket supporting the guidelineinstead of in the guideline itself. While EPA acknowledges that the docketis not readily accessible to persons located outside of the Washington,DC area, EPA disagrees that additional information should be placed inthe guideline. First, the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is not necessarily readily available to personsneeding retread tires information. Second, EPA expects the informationto be constantly changing, rendering the information published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> obsolete. Third, the process for updating theinformation through notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is not as cost-effective as other mechanisms.As a result, EPA plans to use other, less formal, highly available mechanismsto disseminate and update price, performance, and availability information.A. PriceSection 6002 provides that a procuring agency may not purchase a designateditem if the price is ``unreasonable.'' Commenters on several of the procurementguidelines stated that a ``reasonable price'' includes price preferences.However, as EPA stated in the paper guideline, 52 FR 37298-37299 (October6, 1987), RCRA section 6002 does not provide explicit authority to EPAto authorize or recommend payment of a price preference or to create aset-aside. Therefore, unless an agency has an independent authority toprovide a price preference or to create a set-aside, EPA believes thata price is ``unreasonable'' if it is greater than the price of a competingproduct made of virgin material.A commenter stated that EPA's interpretation of the unreasonable priceprovision is a decision not to buy recycled products in every instanceexcept those in which the price is either lower than that for a virginproduct or in which there is a tie between the virgin and recycled product.The commenter is incorrect. A recycled product might not be purchased inevery case, even using price premiums as the commenter proposes, due tounavailability or lack of satisfactory competition. A recycled productalso might not be purchased in every instance due to unreasonable discrimination,which is the problem that RCRA section 6002 and EPA's procurement guidelinesare intended to eliminate. In attempting to overcome this problem, however,EPA cannot require or recommend that procuring agencies use price premiums.A commenter disagreed with EPA's interpretation of ``unreasonable'' andnoted that the legislative materials upon which EPA relies for this interpretationpost-date by several years the original enactment of RCRA, do not indicateany intention on the part of Congress that section 6002 only apply in therare situation of a tie bid, and only refer to recycled paper. While thecommenter has correctly characterized the legislative materials, EPA disagreesthat one should thus conclude that Congress intended for procuring agenciesto pay a premium price for products procured pursuant to section 6002.EPA believes that if Congress had meant to authorize price premiums, thenCongress would have explicitly said so in section 6002 and/or the legislativehistory. In the absence of this explicit authority, EPA can neither requirenor recommend that procuring agencies pay a premium price.Several commenters stated that procuring agencies should use life-cyclecosting and factor in the avoided cost of tire disposal. These commentersfailed either to suggest how this should be done or to supply any mechanismor methodologies for life-cycle costing in the context of procurement oftire retreading services and tires. EPA has researched the issue, whichproved to be a complex problem. EPA has not been able to develop at thistime a satisfactory methodology for determining life-cycle costing in thiscase. Therefore, EPA has not added a life-cycle costing recommendationto the final guideline.B. Competition and AvailabilityEPA believes that there will be a satisfactory level of competition andavailability of retread tires. Currently, there is an abundant supply ofworn tires in the waste stream that are candidates for retreading, andthere are approximately 2,600 retreading plants located across the country.Therefore, there should be a satisfactory level of competition and availability.The Federal retreading services contracts are awarded on a regional basisthrough small business set-aside procurements. A commenter stated thatit would be impossible for the retreading industry at this small businesslevel and even at the larger business level to handle the volume of demandthat would be generated by all government agencies that are currently suppliedwith new tires; this commenter did not provide any documentation to supportthis assertion, however. EPA notes that procuring agencies are responsiblefor reviewing this type of procurement practice and revising it if it hasa negative impact on procurement of retread tires or tire retreading services.EPA has added a recommendation to andSection; 253.21 of the final guidelinewith respect to procurement practices. In addition, if retread tires ortire retreading services are not available, then procuring agencies arenot required to buy them.Several commenters asked EPA to provide a list of retreaders in the finalguideline. EPA believes that it is inappropriate to do so. First, the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is not readily available to all procuring agenciesaffected by this guideline. Second, the list would require constant updating.EPA plans to establish other less formal, highly available mechanisms fordisseminating this information, such as a telephone hotline. In the meantime,procuring agencies can contact the industry trade associations for assistancein identifying retreaders serving their geographic area; the addressesand telephone numbers of the associations can be found in section III.E.3.of the preamble.C. PerformanceAs discussed elsewhere in this preamble, GSA's retread facility specificationrequires that retreaders have their production facilities certified eitherby GSA or by a nationally recognized retreader association. Once the plantis certified, it is periodically recertified to ensure that it is maintainingsatisfactory operating procedures. In addition, newly retreaded tires areinspected by the retreader to determine that they are free of defects andthat they comply with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Theseinspection and certification procedures help to assure the performanceof retread tires, just as new tire inspection and certification proceduresdo.A commenter stated that retread tires are not equivalent to new tires forall applications and all tire designs. This commenter also noted that theuse of retread or unmatched tires on government vehicles decreases thevalue of the vehicles at the time of resale. Since this commenter did notprovide any data, it is impossible for EPA to respond directly to thesecomments. EPA does note, however, that procuring agencies can prepare specificationsthat limit the use of retread tires where there is a factual, documentedbasis for such limitation. If unmatched tires is a concern, then agencyspecifications should require matched tires, whether they be new or retreadtires. A commenter also objected to use of retread tires of tire retreading servicesbecause retread tires do not carry a mileage guarantee, as new tires do.This is not correct. EPA knows of retreaders that provide mileage guaranteesand/or warranties similar to or identical to new tire warranties. Procuringagencies interested in mileage guarantees or warranties should requirethem as part of their specifications. Commenters also criticized the retread facility inspection and certificationprograms required by Federal specifications as inadequate to assure performanceof retread tires. EPA believes that this criticism is unfounded. The inspectionand certification provisions in the Federal specifications are requiredby GSA, the Federal agency charged with responsibility for developing specificationsto assure tire performance. They were developed by GSA, in conjunctionwith the retreading industry as a means of assuring performance. A commenter questioned the strength of used tire carcasses as comparedto new tires. Information has been submitted to EPA by the American RetreadersAssociation documenting the burst strength of both passenger car tiresand truck tires compared to similar new tires. EPA has placed the testreports, <T3>The Study of Burst Strength New Versus Worn Radial Passenger Tires</T3>(ARA, 1988) and <T3>The Study of Burst Strength New Versus Worn Steel Radial Truck Tires</T3>(ARA, 1988) in the docket for this guideline. Both studies are availablefrom the ARA. EPA recommends that agencies concerned with used tire carcassstrength obtain and evaluate these reports. Finally, some commenters documented performance problems with use of retreadtires. As EPA has discussed above and under the discussion of specifications,RCRA section 6002(d) provides that procuring agencies must revise theirspecifications to maximize use of retread tires without jeopardizing theintended end use of the tires. Use of retread tires can thus be limitedas long as there is a factual, justifiable basis for the limitation. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Miscellaneous Comments </ITAG>A commenter stated that the use of retread tires will only have a temporaryaffect on disposal of used tires. EPA does not follow the logic of thisargument. Since retreading extends the life of a tire and allows the tireto be used again as a tire, it will not be necessary for the user to purchasea new replacement tire. Therefore, there will ultimately be fewer tiresrequiring disposal. Commenters also argued that retreading will not address the long term problemwith tire disposal and that EPA should address other uses of scrap tires.EPA is actively considering other means of recycling scrap tires, is studyingthe feasibility of procurement guidelines for them, and will decide whetherto pursue guidelines after the feasibility study is completed. A commenter suggested that EPA obtain information on the implementationof the guideline from other agencies to be used to revise the guidelinefrom time to time. EPA plans to do this. Section 253.21(d) of the proposed guideline recommended that procuringagencies make determinations regarding competition, availability, and pricein accordance with applicable provisions of the FAR and other applicableFederal law. Commenters suggested that this provision should be deletedas unnecessary and possibly counterproductive. After reconsideration, EPAagrees with the commenters and has deleted this provision. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Implementation </ITAG>Different parts of section 6002 refer to different dates by which procuringagencies must have completed or initiated a required activity: (1) May8, 1986 (i.e., 18 months after enactment of HSWA), (2) one year after thedate of publication of an EPA guideline, and (3) the date specified inan EPA guideline. As a result, there is some confusion with respect towhich activities must be completed or initiated by each date. This sectionof the preamble explains these deadlines. First, under section 6002(d)(1), Federal agencies that have the responsibilityfor drafting or reviewing specifications for procurement items must eliminatefrom such specifications any exclusion of recovered materials and any requirementsthat items be manufactured from virgin materials. This activity was tobe completed by May 8, 1986. Second, procuring agencies must assure that their specifications for procurementitems designated by EPA require the use of recovered materials to the maximumextent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item [section6002(d)(2)]. In addition, procuring agencies must develop an affirmativeprocurement program for purchasing items designated by EPA, in this instance,retread tires [section 6002(i)(1)]. Both of these activities must be completedwithin one year after the date of publication of this guideline as a finalrule. Third, procuring agencies which procure items designated by EPA must beginprocurement of such items containing the highest percentage of recoveredmaterials practicable [section 6002(c)(1)]. In addition, contracting officersmust require vendors to submit estimates and certifications of recoveredmaterials content [section 6002(c)(3)]. Both of these activities must beginafter the date specified by EPA in the applicable guideline. EPA believes that procuring agencies should begin to procure retread tiresor tire retreading services as soon as the specification revisions havebeen completed and the affirmative procurement programs have been developed.Since these latter activities must be completed within one year after publicationof this guideline as a final rule, affirmative procurement should beginno later than one year from publication as well. Section 253.26 specifiesthis implementation date. EPA expects cooperation from affected procuring agencies in implementingthis guideline. Under section 6002(g) of RCRA, the Office of Federal ProcurementPolicy (OFPP), in cooperation with EPA, is responsible for overseeing implementationof the requirements of section 6002 and for coordinating it with otherFederal procurement policies. OFPP is required to report to Congress onactions taken by Federal agencies to implement section 6002.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Analyses</ITAG>A. Environmental and Energy ImpactsThe environmental and energy impacts of the retread tires guideline arediscussed in <T3>Background Document for the Guideline for Federal Procurement of RetreadTires </T3>(E.H. Pechan andamp; Associates, Inc., July 1987), which was includedin the docket for the proposed guideline. In response to comments askingEPA to discuss the impacts in the guideline, the following summary of informationin the background document is provided. Each tire that is retreaded is one less tire disposed of in a landfillor tire pile or otherwise discarded. In addition, because a retread tiresubstitutes for a new replacement tire, there are ultimately less tiresrequiring disposal. Although not all scrap tires can be successfully retreaded,the initial acceptance rate of casings for retreading is between 40 and50 percent, indicating that at least twice as many tires could be retreadedeach year as are currently retreaded.As discussed in section II.C of the preamble, tires are difficult to landfill,and both tires in landfills and tires in piles present threats to humanhealth and the environment. The tires become home to mosquitos and vermin.They also settle unevenly in the landfill, creating problems for futuredevelopment of the landfill site. They also are a potential fire hazard;the fires are expensive to control or contain and result in both air pollutionand potential water pollution from run-off of oily residues.While tire retreading operations generate some pollutants, there is a netenvironmental gain when tires are retreaded instead of discarded.Tire retreading uses significantly less energy than manufacturing of newtires. For example, for each new tire produced, between 7 and 10 gallonsof crude oil are required; tire retreading requires approximately 30 to35 percent of this amount because of the bulk of the crude oil used innew tire manufacturing goes into the fabrication of the casing.Similarly, production of a new tire requires about 14.7 thousand Britishthermal units (Btus) per pound versus about 2.2 Btus per pound for productionof a retread tire. Each retread tire produced, therefore, is capable ofreducing energy consumption by more than 12 thousand Btu/pound, or, assumingan average weight of 25 to 30 pounds for a passenger tire, between 310and 375 thousand Btus of domestic energy consumption can be saved per retreadpassenger tire. The per-tire Btu saving is even greater for truck tiresbecause of their heavier weight.B. Executive Order No. 12291Under Executive Order No. 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulationis major or nonmajor. This guideline is not a major rule because it isunlikely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesetic or export markets.Increased usage of retread tires and tire retreading services addressedby this guideline is not expected to produce recurring annual effects of$100 million or more on the economy. The Federal Procurement Data Centerreported Federal tire purchases of $39,400,000 for 1985, which representedless than \1/3\ of 1 percent of the estimated tire production for the year.The majority of DOD tire procurements are for speciality, heavy-truck,and military equipment vehicles. DOD actively procures retreading servicesfor this equipment already. The impact of this guideline would, therefore,primarily involve the GSA schedule purchases of other agencies. The 1986GSA tire procurements were approximately $4,000,000. If <T3>all </T3>of these new replacement tires were replaced by using retreadingservices, the economic effect would be less than 10 percent of the $100,000,000criteria of Executive Order No. 12291.An expanded potential market for retread tires by increased governmentprocurement is not expected to increase costs of retreading services orprices of retread tires. The retread tire industry is currently characterizedby intense cost competitiveness and excess production capacity. Therefore,an increase in prices for retreading services will be expected to resultin market share losses and decreased profits. Increased prices to governmentagencies may similarly mean loss of that market share.The current goal of the declining retreading industry is to increase netprofits through the reduction of operating expenses. Simply increasingsales will not increase net profits in this industry. A commenter askedEPA to define the circumstances under which profits would increase forthe retreading industry. EPA cannot provide this information. It is outsidethe scope of EPA's responsibility, but even if it were not, the factorsmust be determined by the industry itself, which is most familiar withits operating expenses and procedures.In conclusion, the guideline by itself will have neither adverse effectsnor be significantly advantageous in terms of competitiveness, employmentlevels, capitalization, productivity or innovation in this industry. Theguideline is consistent with the cost-benefit standard of E.O. 12291.This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewas required by Executive Order No. 12291.C. Regulatory Flexibility ActPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an agency publishes a general notice of rulemakingfor any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available forpublic comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impactof the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations,small governmental jurisdictions), unless the Administrator certifies thatthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.As described in th background document prepared for this guideline, theeconomic impact on both small businesses and small governmental jurisdictionsis expected to be in some cases, negligible and in other instances, beneficial,because there will be no net change in the number of small businesses supplyingtires to procuring agencies and most small govenment jurisdictions usenon-Federal funds to procure tires. An extremely limited number of businessand governmental entities are affected at all by the guideline. Therefore,the guideline is not expected to have significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities.For the above reasons, EPA certifies that this guideline will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.As a result, the guideline does not require a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 253</ITAG>Government, procurement, Recycling, Resource recovery,Retreading, Tires.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

(c) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believes that adherence tothe recommendations in the guideline constitutes compliance with section6002. However, procuring agencies may adopt other types of procurementprograms consistent with section 6002. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Designation. </ITAG>EPA designates tires as items which are or can be produced with recoveredmaterials (i.e., used tire casings) and whose procurement by procuringagencies will carry out the objectives of section 6002 of RCRA. For purposesof this guideline, the term ``tires'' does not include airplane tires.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability. </ITAG>(a)(1) This guideline applies to all procuring agencies and to all procurementactions involving tires when the procuring agency makes a purchase, inthe current fiscal year, worth $10,000 or more, or when the cost of suchitems or of functionally equivalent items purchased during the precedingfiscal year was $10,000 or more. For purposes of the $10,000 threshold,all sizes and types of tires should be considered to be ``functionallyequivalent.'' (2) This guideline applies to Federal agencies, to State or local agenciesusing appropriated Federal funds, and to persons contracting with any suchagencies with respect to work performed under such contracts. (i) Federal agencies should note that the requirements of RCRA section6002 apply to them whether or not appropriated Federal funds are used forprocurement of items designated by EPA. (ii) This guideline also applies to State and local agencies and to contractorswhenever commingled Federal and non-Federal funds are used to procure tires.(iii) The $10,000 threshold applies to procuring agencies as a whole ratherthan to agency subgroups such as regional offices or subagencies. (b) The term ``procurement actions'' includes purchases made directly bya procuring agency and purchases made by any person directly in supportof work being performed for a procuring agency (e.g., by a contractor).(c) This guideline does not apply to purchases which are not the directresult of a contract, grant, loan, funds disbursement, or agreement witha procuring agency. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>As used in this guideline: ``Act'' or ``RCRA'' means the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by theResource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6901 <T3>et seq</T3>.``Federal agency'' means any department, agency or other instrumentalityof the Federal Government, any independent agency or establishment of theFederal Government including any Government corporation, and the GovernmentPrinting Office.``Person'' means an individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation(including a government corporation), partnership, association, Federalagency, State, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State,or any interstate body. ``Practicable'' means capable of being used consistent with: performancein accordance with applicable specifications, availability at a reasonableprice, availability within a reasonable period of time, and maintenanceof a satisfactory level of competition.``Procurement item'' means any device, good, substance, material, product,or other item, whether real or personal property, which is the subjectof any purchase, barter, or other exchange made to procure such item.``Procuring agency'' means any Federal agency, or any State agency or agencyof a political subdivison of a State which is using appropriated Federalfunds for such procurement, or any person contracting with any such agencywith respect to work performed under such contract. ``Retread tire'' means a worn automobile, truck, or other motor vehicletire whose tread has been replaced. ``Specification'' means a description of the technical requirements fora material, product, or service that includes the criteria for determiningwhether these requirements are met. In general, specifications are in theform of written commercial designations, industry standards, and otherdescriptive references. ``Tire'' means the following types of tires: passenger car tires, light-and heavy-duty truck tires, high speed industrial tires, bus tires, andspecial service tires (including Military, agricultural, off-the-road,and slow speed industrial). <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Specifications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Revisions.</ITAG>(a) By May 8, 1986, Federal agencies were required to eliminate from theirspecifications any exclusion of retread tires and any requirement thattires be manufactured from virgin materials unless there is a technicalbasis for such exclusion or requirement. (b) Within one year after the date of publication of this guideline, eachprocuring agency must assure that its specifications require the use ofretread tires to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intendedend use of these items. Specifications should indicate the functional requirementsof tires to be procured, including the performance criteria (e.g., highspeed tires), any desired mileage guarantees, and the size and type oftire required. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.11 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exclusions. </ITAG>Any procuring agency which prepares a specification which excludes retreadtires should document its determination that use of retread tires willjeopardize the intended end use of the tire. Such determinations shouldbe based on technical performance information and identify any performancecriteria that cannot be satisfied by retread tires. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Affirmative Procurement Program </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.20 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General. </ITAG>(a) Within one year after the date of publication of this guideline asa final rule, each procuring agency which procures tires must establishan affirmative procurement program for procuring retread tires to the maximumextent practicable. The program must meet the requirements of section 6002(i)of RCRA, including the establishment of a preference program; a promotionprogram; procedures for estimation, certification, and verification; andprocedures for conducting an annual review of the affirmative procurementprogram. This subpart provides recommendations for implementing section6002(i). (b) Federal agencies should note that while the U.S. General Services Administrationexecutes tire contracts, it is not responsible for developing and implementingan affirmative procurement program under RCRA section 6002 for any agencybut itself. Each Federal agency is responsible for its own section 6002affirmative procurement program. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Preference program. </ITAG>(a) EPA recommends that procuring agencies establish preference programsconsisting of two components: (1) Procurement of tire retreading services for the agencies' used carcasses,such as from persons identified on the U.S. General Services Administration'sFederal Supply Schedules. (2) Procurement of tires through competition between vendors of new tiresand vendors of retread tires. Procuring agencies should provide a preferenceto the vendor offering to supply the greatest number of retread tires inthe event that identical low bids are received in response to a solicitation,all other factors being equal. (b) EPA further recommends that procuring agencies establish a tire procurementpolicy stating that the agency will first procure retreading services forits used tires to the maximum extent practicable and, if such servicesare not practicable, obtain replacement tires from the vendor(s) awardedthe contract(s) to supply tires. (c) EPA recommends that a procuring agency that is unable to implementone of the components listed in paragraph (a) of this section documentthat it is unable to purchase retread tires or tire retreading servicesdue to one or more of the following limitations: (1) Unsatisfactory level of competition; (2) Unavailability within a reasonable period of time; (3) Inability to meet the specifications in the invitation for bids, providedthat such specifications satisfy RCRA section 6002(d) and Subpart B ofthis part; (4) Unavailability at a reasonable price. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The agency also must continue to attempt to implement the component.(d) EPA recommends that procuring agencies record the following informationfor each procurement: (1) Type and quantity of tires, (2) Whether new tires, retread tires, or retreading services were procured,(3) Cost per tire, and (4) If new tires are procured, the reason for not procuring retreadingservices or retread tires. (e) Procuring agencies must review their procurement practices and eliminatethose which would inhibit or preclude use of retread tires.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Promotion program. </ITAG>Procuring agencies must develop a promotion program to promote the preferenceprogram. EPA recommends that procuring agencies use the following methods,at a minimum, to promote their preference programs: (a) Place a statement in procurement invitations in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily </T3>describing the preference program. (b) Describe the preference program in tire procurement solicitations orinvitations to bid. (c) Discuss the preference program at bidders' conferences. (d) Inform industry trade associations about the preference program. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.23 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Estimation, certification, and verification.</ITAG>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, contractingofficers must require vendors who supply tires to procuring agencies toestimate the number of retread tires to be supplied. EPA recommends thatprocuring agencies retain these estimates for three years from the datethey are received. (2) The estimation requirement does not apply when a procuring agency purchasestire retreading services using an indefinite quantity contract. (b) EPA recommends that as part of a solicitation for tires as products,procuring agencies require vendors to certify the number of retread tiresto be supplied or the percentage of the total tires to be supplied thatwill be retread tires. (c) Procuring agencies must establish reasonable procedures to verify theestimates. EPA recommends that procuring agencies randomly check the numbersstamped on tire sidewalls to verify that retread tires have been supplied.(In accordance with U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, thetire will be stamped with the symbol DOT-R.) <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.24 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Annual review and monitoring. </ITAG>(a) Each procuring agency must conduct an annual review and monitoringof the effectiveness of its affirmative procurement program. EPA recommendsthat the annual review include the following items: (1) An estimate of the number of retread tires purchased. (2) An assessment of the effectiveness of the preference program. (3) An assessment of remaining barriers to procurement of retread tiresto determine whether they are internal (e.g., resistance to use) or external(e.g., unavailability) barriers. (4) A program to gather statistics. Procuring agencies should monitor theirprocurements to provide data on the following: (i) Comparative price information on competitive procurements; (ii) The quantity of each item procured over a fiscal year; (iii) The availability of retread tires or tire retreading services toprocuring agencies; (iv) Type of performance tests conducted, together with the type of retreadtires that failed the tests, the percentages of all new tires and retreadtires procured, respectively, that failed each test, and the nature ofthe failure; (v) Agency experience with the performance of the procured products. (b) Procuring agencies should prepare a report on their annual review andmonitoring of the effectiveness of their procurement programs and makethese reports available to the public. The reports should contain the followinginformation: (1) A discussion of how the procuring agency's approach procures retreadtires or tire retreading services to the maximum extent practicable. Thebasis for this discussion should be a review of the data compiled on price,availability, and performance, as well as a comparison of estimates andcertifications provided by the vendors. (2) Documentation of specification revisions made during the year. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 253.25 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Implementation. </ITAG>(a) Federal agencies were required to review and revise their specifications,as set forth in andSection; 253.10(a), by May 8, 1986. (b) Procuring agencies are required to revise their specifications as setforth in andSection; 253.10(b), and to establish affirmative procurementprograms, as set forth in Subpart C, on or before November 17, 1989 ofthis guideline as a final rule. (c) Procuring agencies must begin procurement of retread tires, in compliancewith this guideline, by November 17, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-26422 Filed 11-16-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
