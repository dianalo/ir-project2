Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises, a Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust, owns the Hollywood Park race track in Inglewood, Calif., and the Los Alamitos Race Course in Cypress, Calif.    The company said it is still negotiating with SDC Development L.P., Newport Beach, Calif., for the sale of about 300 acres in Cypress, including the Los Alamitos Race Course and 160 acres of undeveloped property. The company announced in May that it had signed a letter of intent to sell the property.    Hollywood Park Realty bought the property in August 1984 and has been delayed in developing it because of zoning disputes. It blamed its cash problems on the delay.    Hollywood Park Realty leases race track operations to Hollywood Park Operating Co., and the stock of the two companies is paired for trading. </TEXT></DOC>
