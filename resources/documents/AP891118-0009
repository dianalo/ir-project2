L'Amour, a favorite of former President Reagan, died of cancerin June 1988 at age 80.   The unpublished works are from what he called his ``toxic dump''_ piles of papers stacked haphazardly on the floor and desk of hisworkroom.   ``I took about seven days of randomly walking around andrandomly sampling stuff to try and find if there was any order ornot,'' said the author's son, Beau, 28. ``After that week I justdecided there wasn't any order.''   L'Amour's ``Education of a Wandering Man,'' published a fewweeks ago, is on the New York Times and the Los Angeles Timesbestseller lists for hardcover nonfiction books.   He was proofreading the memoir the day he died. It was his 105thpublished book, including 86 novels, 16 collections of shortstories and three non-fiction books.   A hardcover book, ``The Sackett Companion,'' and two paperbackcollections of short stories, ``Lonigan'' and ``Long Ride Home,''also have been published since his death.</TEXT></DOC>
