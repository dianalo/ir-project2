Many businesses had cut their growth predictions andissued warnings of tougher times even before the start of the100-hour-long ground war.</LP><TEXT>   Some segments of industry, such as advanced machine-toolmanufacturing, seem likely to emerge from the downturnrelatively unscathed; others -- the auto and textile sectors,for example -- have already resorted to huge layoffs.   But despite depressed internal demand due to war fears,exports are holding up well, particularly to Italy's largestforeign market, Germany. &quot;We're being lifted by the Germanexpansion,&quot; says Luigi Spaventa, professor of politicaleconomy at Rome's La Sapienza University. &quot;What is causingdamage is the dollar weakness,&quot; he says.   From giant corporations like Olivetti to smallfamily-operated firms, businesses say their ability tocompete in world markets has been hurt badly by the dollar'sslump to below 1,100 lire, the U.S. currency's lowest levelagainst the lira in 10 years.   But in the face of the U.S. recession, the boost providedby united Germany's buoyant economy is an unexpected bonus.&quot;This is very important as Germany accounts for over 17% oftotal Italian exports, and may also be the only market toexpand in the first half of 1991,&quot; says Swiss Bank Corp.Stockbroking of London in a survey on Italy.   The German effect is not all positive, however. Bank primerates here rose half a percentage point to 13.5% earlier thismonth -- not a direct result of the recent German rate boostbut of an environment conditioned by Bundesbank policy.   Even optimists conceded that Germany's expansion alonecouldn't keep the Italian economy from feeling the effects ofthe Gulf crisis and recessions in major markets.   Last month, the Italian government lowered its 1991 growthforecast for gross domestic product to an inflation-adjustedrange of 2.2% to 2.4% from a 2.7% estimate last September, onwhich 1991 budget calculations were based. Budget MinisterCirino Pomicino told a parliamentary committee the lowerforecast, which compares with estimated 2.9% growth lastyear, reflected the Gulf crisis.   Many private economists, however, say the government isbeing too optimistic and put likely growth in the range of1.5% to 2%. Employers' federation Confindustria, often one ofthe more pessimistic institutions, forecasts 1.4% growth,while the independent Milan-based Istituto per la RicercaSociale's estimate is as low as 1.2%.   The Milan institute believes that consumer spending willkeep growing but that it will slow to a modest 2% from 2.8%last year. The group also says industrial investment plansthat were put on hold last year could be scrapped altogetherthis year.   Recent data at first sight bear out this pessimistic view.Latest official figures show industrial production fell 1.8%year-to-year in the 1990 fourth quarter, after a 0.5% fall inthe third quarter. Production for the year fell 0.1%,bringing down the curtain firmly on the long expansion of the1980s.   Confindustria estimates that production fell 1.3%year-to-year in January, and one key performance barometer,machine-tool orders, slid 17.2% last year.   &quot;It's a classic sign of recession . . . companies havebeen postponing investments,&quot; says Confindustria DirectorGeneral Innocenzo Cipolletta.   But the machine-tool picture is more complex than theglobal figure suggests. Although domestic sales were muchmore depressed during the year than export orders, implying asharp downturn in Italian investment, the overall decline inthe final 1990 quarter was much less steep than in thepreceding period. And within the sector, some areas areperforming much better than others.   &quot;There have been three or four years of very favorablebusiness,&quot; for makers of conventional machine tools, &quot;so apause for breath is natural,&quot; says Giancarlo Mandelli,president of Piacenza-based Gruppo Mandelli, one of theindustry's big companies. &quot;In advanced production systems,the picture is much more satisfactory,&quot; he says, adding:&quot;Companies have an urgent need to cut costs, especially laborcosts -- so they are automating.&quot;   Declining demand has badly hit the car business, and Fiathas been forced to resort to temporary plant closings andmassive layoffs at regular intervals since September to keepstocks from rising too high.   The company's drastic moves have had a ripple effect inthe auto-parts industry and the national economy. Yet it isnot all bad news in the car industry, either.   The current downturn in European sales comes after fiveboom years, during which Fiat reported record sales andprofits. And despite the 1990 industry sales slump, this yearis off to a more promising start, with Italian new-cardeliveries rising 1.6% last month to the second-highestmonthly figure on record.   Economists say that a long war, or a rebound in oilprices, could upset current forecasts. But for now, Italy'sprospects are judged with cautious optimism. &quot;There will be aslowdown, yes. But as for a full recession, that's lesslikely.&quot; says Mr. Spaventa of La Sapienza University.</TEXT></DOC>
