The government approval was expected and followed decisions last month by the French and British governments to provide a total of $1.7 billion in aid to Aerospatiale and British Aerospace PLC for their portions of the Airbus program. The fourth Airbus partner, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain, has only a 4.2% stake in the project and hasn't asked its government for aid.    The German aid package falls short of the seven billion marks Messerschmitt sought, but the company said the money nonetheless paved the way for work to begin on the long-range A-340 and the medium-range A-330 airliners &quot;to the extent planned.&quot;    The government's pledge of three billion marks over seven years will cover about 90% of the German share of developing the sister airplanes. Bonn also is committed to assuming 1.9 billion marks of debt Messerschmitt has accumulated from prior Airbus projects.    The Economics Ministry said Messerschmitt has provided sufficient assurances that it will be able to repay the development grants from the proceeds of airplane sales. Officials also said the decision to provide the subsidies was influenced by the fact that 20,000 people directly or indirectly work for Airbus projects in West Germany.    Airbus already has received 87 commitments for the four-engined A-340 from customers that include Lufthansa of Germany, Air France and Northwest Airlines of the U.S.. It said it has 41 commitments for the twin-jet A-330 from clients that include Northwest and Air Inter, a domestic French carrier.    An Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France, said yesterday that the timeliness of the funding pledges will permit Airbus to stick to its schedule of introducing the A-340 in 1992 and the A-330 one year later.    Airbus partners say the A-340 and A-330 are crucial to keeping the consortium competitive in the world aircraft market. Because they are longer-range aircraft, Airbus now will be able to compete with Boeing Co.'s 747 jumbo and long-range 767 jets, and with McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new long-range MD-11.    The U.S. has objected to European governments' assistance to Airbus, as the group increasingly is challenging U.S. makers. Airbus has said it expects to sell 1,000 of the new planes, representing total revenue of about $80 billion.    Sources in West Germany's Economics Ministry said the decision to assume 1.9 billion marks of Messerschmitt debt is part of Bonn's efforts to attract new industrial partners to Germany's Airbus stake. By easing the risk for new partners, the project's desirability to industry could be enhanced and the government could reduce its participation in Airbus.    German sources say Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG are leading candidates for future Airbus collaboration. But neither concern will comment on the possibility.    There has been speculation that Dornier G.m.b.H., a West German aircraft maker and a Daimler-Benz subsidiary, has been interested in an arrangement by which it would get a promise of financial help from Bonn for the development of its own airliner, the Do-328, in exchange for Daimler-Benz involvement in Airbus. </TEXT></DOC>
