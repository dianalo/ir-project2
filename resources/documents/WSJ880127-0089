Hyatt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AXP </CO><IN> ERN FIN </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Express Co. reported a $104 million loss for the fourth quarter, reflecting previously announced losses at its Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. securities unit and credit loss reserves at its American Express Bank unit.    A year earlier, the big financial services concern had profit of $282 million, or 63 cents a share. Revenue in the latest quarter rose about 5% to $4.28 billion from $4.06 billion.    James D. Robinson III, chairman and chief executive officer, said &quot;we are obviously disappointed&quot; by full-year net income of $533 million, or $1.20 a share, which was less than half the year-earlier net of $1.26 billion, or $2.79 a share. But he pointed out that the company &quot;absorbed extraordinary negative impacts in 1987 and still posted profits in excess of half a billion dollars, a performance that underscores our fundamental strength.&quot;    Revenue for the year rose about 10% to $16.14 billion from $14.58 billion.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading American Express shares fell 50 cents, to $26.    As expected, results for the fourth quarter reflected American Express's equity interest in Shearson Lehman, which had a $95 million loss for the quarter, or $69.6 million for American Express. And American Express Bank had a $295.9 million net loss for the quarter, reflecting a $350 million addition to loan-loss reserves for Third World debt.    The Travel Related Services businesses profit rose 14% to $155 million, and IDS Financial Services, the mutual fund and investment services unit, had a 6.2% profit increase, to $33.7 million.    In the quarter, IDS revenue rose 29% to $877.8 million; Shearson revenue fell 5% to $1.25 billion, and bank revenue rose slightly, to $458.7 million. Travel related services revenue, excluding Fireman's Fund Employers Insurance Co., which was sold at the end of 1986, rose 16% to $1.66 billion.    The figures reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in April 1987 and new accounting rules for deferred income taxes and cardmember and loan fees. The 1986 full-year net included a gain of $140 million, or 31 cents a share, on sale of an interest in Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc.    During the year, American Express said, travel related services profit rose 16% to a record $655 million; card charge volume rose 18% to $75 billion; and Travelers Cheque sales rose 16% to almost $20 million. IDS profit rose 21% to $124 million on a 25% increase in revenue. Although sales of mutual funds declined, sales rose for insurance, annuities and investment certificates. At year end, IDS owned or managed $34 billion in assets, a 12% increase from a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
