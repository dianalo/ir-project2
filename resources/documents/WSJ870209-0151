Mr. Clark correctly describes the postwar world industrial environment. The productive capacity of our potential (now current) competitors was in shambles. For the next 15 or 20 years, therefore, American industry had a picnic! If labor wanted more money while productivity dropped, we gave it to them and passed the increase on to the customer. I frequently remind my friends who blame economic problems on the high cost of labor that there were always two signatures on those contracts.    During the period of easy sales and profit, management became fat, lazy and incompetent. Obviously, there were exceptions, and just as I would not indict all management, I cannot accept universal applause for all the multinational companies and their managements. The examples of poor, inattentive managing -- of bad business decisions, lack of long-range planning and out-and-out corporate criminality are plentiful.    I agree, however, that our trade deficit is not primarily the result of mismanagement on the part of our large multinationals. In a recent Indiana survey, it was learned that 81% of the business respondents derived none of their revenue from exports. Further, in answer to the question &quot;What percentage of your revenues would you like to be derived from exports?&quot; 63% answered &quot;None.&quot; Bear in mind, Indiana is one of the leading export states in the Midwest.    The real problem lies in our inability to interest U.S. manufacturers, particularly small-business men, in export markets. Those who do participate are unwilling to adjust their policies and products to the needs and demands of their foreign customers. We, in effect, say, &quot;Here's the product that we make for the American market -- take it or leave it.&quot; No matter that the dimensions are of the inch scale rather than metric, that the design is for American tastes rather than local, or that the instructions, warranties and other printed matter are in English. Just imagine how much success the Japanese and Europeans would have selling their products in the U.S. using such same business practices!    Unless we can interest the small and medium-sized manufacturer in aggressively seeking sales outside of the domestic market, the trade-balance problem will remain with us until it becomes catastrophic.    Leonard M. Goldstein   President, Midland Inc.   Fort Wayne, Ind.   ---   Re your Jan. 20 page-one article &quot;Falling Greenback&quot;: For the administration to pin hopes on a falling dollar to solve the trade deficit is to ignore a couple of immutable realities.    After having lost customers all over the world during the past five years or so owing to price/quality discrepancies with non-U.S. products, we can't expect these ex-customers to change their loyalties back to U.S.-made products overnight. It will take months and years of effort to win them back.    Also, many smaller companies that collectively were responsible for the majority of U.S. exports before 1980 have dismantled their export departments in recent years and no longer have the in-house expertise to promote and support export sales.
