The authors propose a specificprogramming language, TEMPLOG, which extends the classical PROLOG-likelanguages to include temporal operators. PROLOG programs are collectionsof classical Horn clauses and they are efficiently interpreted by SLD-resolution.Similarly, TEMPLOG programs are collections of temporal Horn clauses,and they interpret them with temporal SLD-resolution, a restricted formof a general temporal resolution method.</TEXT></DOC>
