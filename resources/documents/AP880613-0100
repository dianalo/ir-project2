Bush was asked at the White House whether he agreed with a moveby the Democrats to have their party platform brand South Africa``a terrorist state.''   ``I think it's a racist state, regrettably,'' he said.   That language was stronger than President Reagan uses, butBush's policy recommendation was the same as the Reaganadministration has followed. He said the government must seewhether ``the United States can use its moral influence to changethings'' in South Africa.   The new Harris poll showed Dukakis with a 5-point lead, justwithin the survey's margin of potential sampling error. That wasdown from a 7-point advantage in a similar poll last month.   Dukakis was supported by 49 percent, Bush by 44 percent and 7percent were unsure in the poll in which Lou Harris andamp; Associatescontacted 1,258 likely voters the first week of June. The margin ofsampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.   One day earlier, Bush, seeking black support, edged away fromthe Reagan administration on aid to minority businesses, whileDemocrat Dukakis suggested he would use the U.S. military to helpfight the war on drugs.   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, struck a conciliatory stance on thetouchy issue of whether he wants to be the Democratic vicepresidential candidate. After declaring last week that he wasentitled to consideration and that ``consideration means anoffer,'' Jackson backed off a bit.   ``I do not want to push Mike Dukakis to that point,'' Jacksonsaid Sunday, interviewed from Chicago on NBC-TV's ``Meet thePress.'' Asked whether he should be offered the No. 2 spot, he saidonly that he deserved ``serious consideration.''   Jackson spent the weekend in his hometown of Chicago, mullinghis next move. He has said he will campaign all the way up to theDemocratic convention. Dukakis wrapped up the Democratic nominationin the final four primaries last week.   The Massachusetts governor was meeting today with congressionalleaders and law enforcement officials from several states todiscuss drug issues. He also sounded an anti-drug theme on Sunday,when he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors the administration'santi-drug effort is in a state of ``chaos.''   That was an apparent dig at Bush, who headed an administrationtask force on anti-drug efforts. Without providing specifics,Dukakis told the mayors, meeting in Salt Lake City, that themilitary should be prepared to assist in drug-interdiction efforts.   ``It will take tough, sustained and unrelenting enforcement ...at home and abroad, enforcement which uses the military whereappropriate and necessary,'' he said.   As Dukakis spoke, Democratic party platform drafters werecalling for the appointment of a federal drug czar. Aplatform-drafting panel wrapped up a long weekend of work Sunday atthe resort of Mackinac Island, Mich.   In addition to backing a drug czar, the Democrats releasedworking papers that urged expanded AIDS research, adoption of theEqual Rights Amendment, greater efforts to end homelessness, and alaw requiring employers to give workers advance notice of plantclosings.   The Jackson forces had mixed success at the platform-draftingsessions. The committee agreed the Democratic platform will labelSouth Africa a terrorist state, as Jackson has demanded. But thepanel was split on whether to call for a Jackson-backed freeze inPentagon spending, and expressed reluctance to call for the taxhikes Jackson wants.   Despite some bickering, the Democrats put up a united front.   ``I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep.William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the draftingpanel and a Jackson supporter.   The Republicans, too, were making like a happy family. Over theweekend in Denver, at the first of three ``unity conferences'' bythe Republican National Committee, GOP activists from 16 states _and three former rivals for the nomination _ rallied around Bush.   The vice president, who pleased many Republican observers whenhe went on the offensive last week against Dukakis, promised theparty faithful on Saturday they'd be seeing more of the same.   ``We're just beginning,'' he said.   Another Bush tactic has been distancing himself from the WhiteHouse on selected issues. One of them is likely to be civil rights,and the vice president stepped slightly away from theadministration on the use of federal aid to assist minoritybusinesses.   ``I support strongly increased minority development efforts bythe federal government,'' he said in a commencement speech Sundayat predominantly black Central State University in Wilberforce,Ohio. ``We must bring black Americans and other minorities into thefree enterprise system.''   The Reagan administration has opposed government programs thatset aside a portion of contracts for minority-run businesses. Suchset-asides have been used by federal, state and local governmentsas a way to remedy past discrimination.   Bush, who celebrated his 64th birthday Sunday, was awarded anhonorary degree by the university.   Later Sunday, the vice president flew to Danville, Va., where hecampaigned for GOP congressional candidate Linda Arey and repeatedhis call for Dukakis to join him in requesting an independentcounsel's investigation of alleged ethics breaches by DemocraticHouse Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.   Wright, who is under preliminary investigation by the HouseEthics Committee, has denied the allegations.   Bush was back in Washington today, where he planned to spend thefirst part of the week. Dukakis scheduled a three-day Southerncampaign swing later in the week.</TEXT></DOC>
