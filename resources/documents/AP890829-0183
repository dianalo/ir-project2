(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Alabama, one of the nation's biggestdumping grounds for toxic waste, announced a ban Tuesday onhazardous waste shipments from 22 states and the District ofColumbia.   Gov. Guy Hunt said the ban _ the second in the nation _ wasnecessary to prevent ``Alabama from becoming the waste dump of thenation.''   Alabama's ban mirrors one enacted earlier this year in SouthCarolina. The Alabama ban takes effect Sept. 14, but may wind up incourt.   Richard Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous WasteTreatment Council in Washington, said the lobbying group isdetermined to overturn Alabama and South Carolina's laws. He saidthe state laws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and willproduce a shortage of sites nationally to handle hazardous waste.   ``It is virually certain we will challenge one,'' Fortuna said.``The only question is whether we will challenge both.''   According to figures compiled by state environmental officials,Alabama is fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it gets fromother states. When the amount of waste shipped out of each state iscompared to the amount brought in, Alabama jumps to No. 2 in netintake. Indiana is listed first in amount received as well as netintake.   Alabama's ban comes from a new state law that says states can'tship hazardous wastes to Alabama if they don't allow for disposal ofhazardous wastes within their own borders or don't have acooperative agreement with Alabama. Alabama has signed nocooperative agreements.   The law was approved by the Legislature and the governor in May,but the lawmakers left it up to the state Department ofEnvironmental Management to determine which states would beaffected. A list was released Tuesday.   Sue Robertson, chief of the department's land division, said theban only affects a landfill at Emelle, which is the nation's largesthazardous waste landfill. The law leaves it up to the landfilloperator, Chemical Waste Management, to deny shipments from thebanned states.   Chemical Waste spokesman Chris Grimshawe said the company isstill studying the list and will decide whether to take legal action.   A violation of the ban is punishable by up to 10 years in prisonand a $10,000 fine. The state could also go to court to seek civilpenalties of up to $25,000 per day per violation.   Among the banned states, 18 and the District of Columbia have nodisposal facilities. They are Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida,Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, NewMexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont,Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.   Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington state were banned becausethey did not respond to the state's request for information abouthazardous waste disposal within their borders.</TEXT></DOC>
