Philippines prison inmates trade organs for reducedsentences. Brokers in human body parts take their cut of a shadowymarket.   The forces of supply and emand in the desperate world of organtransplants have created a commercial trade in human organs thatworries health officials and ethicists worldwide.   The need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing asresearch advances and surgery is more successful. But the number ofdonated organs has failed to keep pace. Doctors say too few peopledie in circumstances that provide transplantable organs. When theydo, relatives are often too grieved to donate a loved one's organ orobject for religious or cultural reasons.   Last fall, reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings wereroutinely buying babies in Third World countries and selling them toAmerican and Israeli families whose children needed organtransplants drew angry U.S. reaction.   The State Department in October blamed the Soviet Union for thereports and said a European Parliament resolution criticizing thepurported activity was based on ``false and misleading statementsand a discredited report by a Soviet front organization.''   What to do about the organ trade varies. The United States, Japanand West Germany ban it. In India, such trade thrives legally.Lawmakers in Britain and the Philippines have just begun grapplingwith the matter.   ``There simply doesn't seem to be any country that has a publicpolicy to generate enough organs to meet the demand,'' said ArthurCaplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at theUniversity of Minnesota.   The World Health Organization in May called for a global ban oncommercial trafficking in human organs. Dr. Ursula Lehr, the WestGerman health minister, spoke for the ban.   ``The idea of business-minded brokers taking advantage of thefinancial distress of people in the Third World, buying their organsfor a pittance and reselling them to wealthy patients in developedcountries, is awful for me,'' she said.   But some ask what's wrong if people, fully informed of the risks,decide to sell one of their organs, for example, a kidney? Thequestion, however, becomes complicated when the potential donor isdesperately poor. People can live with one kidney, and offers fortransplantable kidneys have ranged in individual instances from$3,000 to $20,000.   ``Is it really for us, who are not faced with those difficultiesand that heart-rending decision, to deny people that choice?'' NeilHamilton, a British lawmaker, asked in recent parliamentary debate.   ``It really isn't a choice if you're coerced by poverty,'' saidCaplan, the Minnesota ethicist.   Others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply ofdonated organs and make transplants more expensive in general.   ``We believe ... organs would go to the highest bidder ratherthan to the patient who needs them most,'' said Bernadette Haze, aspokeswoman for the Netherlands-based Eurotransplant, which matchesorgan donors and recipients in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,West Germany and Austria.   Britain, which has no law controlling the sale of organs, took upthe issue this year after a Turk was arrested in Istanbul forarranging commercial transplants at a private London hospital. Oneof the ``donors'' contended he was duped and robbed of his kidney.   The alleged organ broker, Tunc Ay Kunter, was convicted May 18and sentenced to two years in prison for brokering the sale of aTurkish peasant's kidney to a Libyan doctor. Police said Kunterconfessed to arranging four such sales when he was arrested.   Turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling, brokeringor buying human organs.   The peasant, Ahmet Koc, who got a two-year suspended sentence,contended he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a joboffer and thought he was being anesthetized for the checkup. Afterthe kidney was removed, he said he was paid the equivalent of $4,267.   British lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crimeto pay or receive payment for a human organ. Parliament is expectedto pass it this month.   Organ sales are not illegal in the Philippines, but in late May,the vice president of the Philippines Senate filed a bill to bansales of human organs and tissues, calling practitioners``modern-day Draculas.''   Filipino death row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 aspart of a program to reduce overcrowding without resorting towidespread executions, explained Pablo Rosales, assistant directorof the National Penitentiary. Rosales said most donor inmatesavoided execution and some were freed after spending a few moreyears in prison.   When capital punishment was banned in 1987, prisoners startedasking for money, he said. One prisoner who donated a kidney evencomplained to Rosales that he received only $95, without themini-cassette recorder he was promised.   Media attention greatly reduced the number of people seekingprisoners' organs, Rosales said, and no prisoner has donated akidney since last year.   But Rosales believes organ sales continue with private donors,most likely poor slum dwellers.   Dr. Kazuo Ota, chairman of the Japan Society for Transplantation,said he knew of several patients who had organ transplants in thePhilippines and that some Japanese were acting as organ brokers.Organ sales are banned in Japan.   Dr. Jorge Neumann of the Sao Paulo Heart Institute and a memberof the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplants said ``certainlythere exists a black market of organs in Brazil.'' But he said nostatistics on organ sales were available.   In the United States, selling organs has been illegal since 1984and sentiment against the practice is high. But allegations ofinfluence peddling in arranging precious transplants surface fromtime to time.   In April, Justice Department investigators said they had droppedan investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon ThomasStarzl, head of transplants at Presbyterian-University andChildren's hospitals in Pittsburgh, had given high-paying foreignerspreferential treatment.   The investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28percent of transplants performed by Starzl's team in 1984-5 were onforeigners who often weren't as sick as other patients or had waiteda shorter time, but who had paid surgeon's fees four times higherthan Americans who had the same operations.   Caplan argues for regulations to ensure that medical need, ratherthan money or influence, determines who gets available organs.   Some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reducedif a neutral party, such as government, replaced organ brokers. Anddonations might increase with incentives such as compensation todonors or their families for all medical costs, time lost from workor burial expenses. There could also be a break on inheritance orother taxes.   Recently, transplant researchers began looking at animal-to-humantransplants.   At a May meeting of the American Society of TransplantPhysicians, researchers predicted pigs would become the main sourceof donor organs once cross-species transplantation becomes practical.   ``There's always been a shortage of organs and there probablyalways will be unless we learn to take them out of animals,'' saidCaplan. ``I don't know if it's going to be biologically feasible,but I think that's the direction we have to try.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 9</NOTE></DOC>
