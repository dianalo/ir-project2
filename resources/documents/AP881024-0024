In interviews last week, Dukakis adviser Jack Riggs and Bushadviser William Martin said the next president will have to maketradeoffs between energy and the environment.   ``There is almost always going to be a conflict between some ofour energy policies and some of our environmental policies,'' saidRiggs, majority staff director of the energy and power subcommitteeof the House Energy and Commerce Committee.   Martin, a former deputy energy secretary, said, ``We're going tofind instances where energy security objectives and environmentalobjectives are going to go head to head against each other.''   They were interviewed for a radio program, ``Energy Update,''whose tapes are produced by Americans for Energy Independence, astudy organization supported by unions, companies and othersinterested in a strong domestic energy supply. The tapes will bebroadcast in the two weeks before the election.   There are both differences and similarities between thecandidates.   Some differences:   _Bush favors exploration of the Arctic National Wildlife Refugein Alaska, a good drilling prospect. Dukakis opposes it.   _Dukakis would keep motor vehicle mileage standards but opposesstandards that ``directly cause a major penalty to the U.S.economy.'' Bush would drop the standards.   Some similarities:   _Both candidates favor tax incentives to encourage domestic oilproduction and oppose new tariffs, sometimes called ``import fees.''   _Both oppose other energy taxes, such as higher gasoline taxesor a levy on the carbon content of fuels, at the moment. Dukakiswould consider them if new revenue were needed, but would resisttaxes that would hurt one segment of the industry more than another.   _Both expect and favor major growth in natural gas as an energysource.   Some shadings:   _Bush believes in nuclear power but recognizes ``it does have aproblem of public confidence and safety.'' Dukakis believes ``wecannot even begin to consider promoting nuclear power as part ofour energy mix'' without a new generation of safer reactors, asolution to the waste disposal problem and stronger safetyoversight.   Opposition from Dukakis has helped prevent the startup of anuclear plant in New Hampshire just over the state line.   Dukakis believes the nation needs a ``core supply'' of domesticoil production, currently about 8.2 million barrels a day or 9percent below the decade's peak year of 1985. Some 300,000 jobshave been lost since then.   ``I have not seen anything from Gov. Dukakis that would try toput that in barrels per day or a percentage of our energy needs,''Riggs said.   Dukakis opposes a higher tariff because it is ``a tremendouslyinefficient way to raise revenue and a tremendously inefficient wayto help energy industries,'' Riggs said. ``It would help domesticenergy industries by putting huge burdens on farmers and businessand consumers.''   Martin was principal author of a departmental report last yearconcluding a major oil tariff would cost the economy almost threetimes as many jobs as it would restore to the domestic oil industry.   ``While some energy objectives might be realized through taxes _in the case of a gasoline tax you might conserve more; in the caseof an import fee we might produce more _ the fact is there is apenalty on the economy as a whole,'' Martin said.   Martin said tax incentives favored by Bush could increaseproduction by 600,000 barrels a day and cost $600 million in annualtax revenue.</TEXT></DOC>
