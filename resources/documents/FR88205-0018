This proposed rule waspublished in response to a petition from the Fund. The petition was publishedas part of the proposed rule. The petition and the preamble to the proposedrule described the bases for the proposed changes to the current regulations,and the Department's observations on the petition, respectively (52 FR24181).The Department of the Interior received three sets of comments from twosources. One commenter was the Environmental Protection Agency, which theDepartment of the Interior had specifically requested to comment (52 FR24182). The other was the Fund, which on two separate occasions providedsubstantive comments and comments concerning typographical errors containedin the proposed rule.A summary of the comments and the Department's responses to the commentsfollow.<ITAG tagnum="84">1. Notification Requirements</ITAG>EPA commented that the first sentence of proposed andSection; 29.8(a) failedto make clear whether the discovery of an incident must be made by theperson in charge of the vessel and whether the incident must involve thevessel. EPA then suggested language to clarify the meaning of the sentence.As the Department intended that the obligations of the person in chargeof the vessel would begin as soon as he or she becomes aware of an incidentinvolving his or her vessel, this comment has merit. Accordingly, the Departmenthas revised the first sentence, although the specific language suggestedby EPA has not been used. EPA also suggested, concerning the same sentence, that the regulation specifythat the notification of the incident be made to the National ResponseCenter rather than the ``Coast Guard.'' EPA's stated concern was that withoutthe change a person in charge of a vessel might contact a Coast Guard unitrather than the National Response Center. As the Department's intent wasthat the person in charge of the vessel should contact the National ResponseCenter, the EPA's suggestion is accepted with clarification to assure itis understood that the National Response Center is operated by the CoastGuard. EPA also suggested that in the last sentence of proposed andSection; 29.8(a)the citation to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) be clarified,and that a reference be made to EPA's recently promulgated regulationsimplementing the notification requirements of the FWPCA. The citation clarificationhas been made. The Department also agrees to make reference to the EPA'snotification requirements; the change is consistent with the Department'sintent that the andSection; 29.8 notification requirements are in additionto notification requirements under the FWCPA. Finally, EPA suggested that in proposed andSection; 29.8(b) the term ``CoastGuard'' be replaced with ``National Response Center.'' This change hasbeen made. To be consistent with the other changes in andSection; 29.8 thereference to ``Coast Guard'' in andSection; 29.8(c)(1) has also been changedto ``National Response Center.'' A conforming change has also been madeto andSection; 29.1(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">2. Definitions </ITAG>EPA comments that the use of the term ``spill'' in proposed andSection; 29.8(c)(1)and (d) could cause confusion as the term ``spill'' is not defined in proposedandSection; 29.1. EPA suggests that the term ``incident'', which is definedin proposed andSection; 29.1, be used instead of ``spill''. The Departmentagrees that without some reference to ``spill'' in andSection; 29.1 someconfusion could arise. Accordingly, the Department is amending andSection;29.1(h) to indicate that ``incident'' and ``spill'' can be used interchangeably.EPA also commented that proposed andSection; 29.1(h) (definition of ``incident'')would limit incidents to instances where there is a ``discharge of TAPSoil''. The Department recognizes that section 204(c)(1) of the Trans-AlaskaPipeline Authorization Act applies to ``discharges of oil'' from a vesselcarrying TAPS oil, and did not intend to change the statutory application.Accordingly, the Department has amended andSection; 29.1(h) to indicate thatan incident ``means a discharge of oil from a vessel which is carryingTAPS oil loaded on that vessel. . . .'' The Fund questioned in two respects the basis for the Department's disagreementwith the Fund's rationale for the deletion of proposed andSection; 29.1(e)(7)(numbered as andSection; 29.1(d)(7) prior to the promulgation of this finalrule), found at 52 FR 24181-82. First, the Fund questions the Department'sobservation that the current regulation could be read as making loss oftax revenue an element of damages without a showing of proximate cause;the Fund notes that proximate cause must be shown for all damages underthe Act. The Fund is correct; under the current regulations and as amended,any claim may be paid only upon a showing that the economic loss arisesout of or results directly from an incident. See andSection; 29.1(e). The Fund also asserts the Department states incorrectly in the preambleto the proposed rule that loss of tax revenues may constitute damages.The Department disagrees with this comment. The Department's intent isonly that if a claimant is able to demonstrate that any economic loss arisesout of or results directly from an incident, that claim may be paid underthe Act. If a claimant can make this showing for loss of tax revenues,the claim may be paid by the Fund. <ITAG tagnum="84">3. Typographical and Clarifying Changes </ITAG>The Department has made a number of minor changes of a typographical natureas the result of comments from the Fund and Departmental staff. The Departmenthas also made several minor clarifying changes based on comments from Departmentalstaff. Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under E.O. 12291, because these regulations deal only withthe administration of the Fund. Any economic effects should be very small,and any adverse effects on competition, employment, investigation, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets are expectedto be insignificant. Because these regulations deal only with the administrationof the Fund and it is not anticipated that these regulations will affectany small entities, the Department has certified that this document willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.).Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements contained in amended 43 CFR 29.9have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget as required by44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned approval No. 1084-0026.Environmental EffectsThis rule is categorically excluded from the National Environmental ProtectionAct (NEPA) process because it is of an administrative, financial, legal,technical and procedural nature, and therefore neither an environmentalassessment nor an environmental impact statement is required (40 CFR 1508.4;516 DM 2.3A).Drafting InformationThe primary authors of this document are Robert H. Moll and Timothy S.Elliott of the Office of the Solicitor, in consultation with Bruce Blanchard,Director, Office of Environmental Project Review.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 29</ITAG>Alaska, Oil pollution, Pipelines.This final rule is issued under the authority of section 204(c) of theTrans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, 43 U.S.C. 1653(c)(4), and sections311(p)(1) and 311(p)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33U.S.C. 1321(p)(1), (2).For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Title 43, Part 29 is revisedto read as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 29_TRANS-ALASKA PIPELINE LIABILITY FUND</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.1 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.2 Creation of the Fund.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.3 Fund administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.4 General powers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.5 Officers and employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.6 Financing, accounting and audit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.7 Imposition of strict liability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.8 Notification and advertisement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.9 Claims, settlement and adjudication.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.10 Subrogation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.11 Investment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.12 Borrowing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.13 Termination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">29.14 Information collection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 204(c), Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act,43 U.S.C. 1653(c); Secs. 311(p)(1) and 311(p)(2) of the Federal Water PollutionControl Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321 (p)(1), (2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 29.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>As used in this part:(a) ``Act'' means the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, Title IIof Pub.
