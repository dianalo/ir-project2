The disclosure prompted speculation from some analysts that the company has decided on its first step toward eventually shedding most, if not all, of its tobacco business.    Reynolds earlier said it was considering a master limited partnership for the tobacco business. But the disclosure of the possible ownership stake is the company's first indication that it has a specific structure in mind.    Offering only 5% of the business would be &quot;the best way to test the water, to see how the market values the tobacco business,&quot; said Joseph C. Frazzano, analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. &quot;If they're satisfied, they could sell more of it,&quot; he said.    Neal Kaplan, analyst with Interstate Securities Corp., said that to take full advantage of tax benefits from a master limited partnership, the company must sell at least a majority of the tobacco business.    Despite the tobacco, food and beverage concern's latest disclosure, some analysts -- citing big legal, tax and other obstacles to creating tobacco partnerships -- are still skeptical that the company will choose a partnership to shed its tobacco business.    It is &quot;certainly not imminent and may not be possible,&quot; said David A. Goldman, analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc.    RJR suggested the possibility of a 95%-owned partnership in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing on an unrelated debt offering.    &quot;Under the proposal currently being studied, one or more of RJR's affiliates would be the general partner or partners of the master limited partnership and would continue to be responsible for directing the business operations of the tobacco business,&quot; the filing said. &quot;It is currently anticipated that RJR would retain ownership of partnership interests representing at least 95% of the economic value of the partnership. RJR hasn't determined whether this proposal or any other similar or different proposal to restructure its tobacco business will be implemented,&quot; the company said. A spokesman declined to elaborate on the filing.    Some industry sources believe that RJR is considering the 95% partnership option as the least-controversial means of possibly separating the tobacco business. It would test the value of the tobacco business, which the company believes isn't receiving fair value in the marketplace, while soothing the feelings of its home town, Winston-Salem, N.C., as it prepares to move the corporate headquarters to Atlanta in September.    For months, analysts, employees and industry executives have speculated that RJR would like to get out of the tobacco business, or move to distance itself from the business and its product-liability problems.    But the master limited partnership wouldn't insulate the company, as general partner, from the potential liability posed by lawsuits from cancer victims. Analysts also note that the tobacco operations would be hard to sell in the form of a partnership because of sheer size. RJR's U.S. tobacco business had profit from operations of almost $1.5 billion in 1986. And pricing the units to reflect the risks would be an obstacle to their sale, some analysts said.    One reason the 95% option doesn't seem viable in the long run is that the dividends RJR would receive as general partner would be taxable and the company might not see much improvement in its own stock price as a result of the spinoff. Partnership investors also would receive an after-tax dividend that is less than the company's current after-tax dividend.    &quot;We don't think it is a value-enhancing move,&quot; said Diana K. Temple, analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Initially, only U.S. cigarette operations could be converted to a partnership because it isn't clear that foreign tax laws would permit a partnership, she said. Also, if RJR's debt, which is expected to be $3.8 billion at yearend, is split evenly between Nabisco and the domestic tobacco business, Nabisco would be left with $1.9 billion in debt, but only $143 million in annual cash flow, she said.    Still, the master limited partnership has some appeal to investors. Selling a mere 5% of the tobacco business would allow the company to retain control of a valuable asset while generating a huge infusion of cash that could be used to buy back shares or to further diversify.    ---   RJR Unit to Sell Division   TORONTO -- Nabisco Brands Ltd. said it is seeking a buyer for its confectionery division, which makes such brands as Planters nuts and Life Savers candy in Canada.    The proposed sale is part of the RJR Nabisco Inc. unit's plan to focus on its most-profitable interests, including its biscuits and cereals business, a spokeswoman said. She declined to estimate the division's value or its contribution to Nabisco's sales or earnings.    Nabisco has retained Burns Fry Ltd., a securities dealer here, as a financial adviser.    Nabisco is one of Canada's largest consumer-goods companies, with sales of $941.7 million (Canadian) in the year ended Dec. 31. In 1986, Nabisco sold several assets, including its Fleischmann division operations and its pet food interests. </TEXT></DOC>
