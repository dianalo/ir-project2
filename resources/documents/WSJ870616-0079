Since then, the 53-year-old Mr. Vander Zalm, perhaps the most conservative and colorful politician in Canada, has adopted the shovel as a personal symbol. He occasionally distributes gold-shovel lapel pins, and he proudly admits to having auctioned off, for charity, $100,000 of shovels, complete with cards enrolling purchasers into the Loyal Order of Shovelers.    After a three-year absence from provincial politics, Mr. Vander Zalm returned triumphantly last summer and began introducing policies that he hopes will keep shovelers and other workers busy. But so far, the self-made millionaire's plans to spark a boom have instead sparked fury among opponents of his Social Credit Party.    Fishermen, native Indians and other groups are protesting his plans to lift a ban on offshore oil and natural-gas exploration. Anti-nuclear activists are aghast because he ended a moratorium on uranium exploration. His support of trade with South Africa enraged foes of apartheid. And unions are seething over his labor bill, expected to become law this week.    Earlier this month, at least 250,000 unionized workers shut down most of British Columbia's mines, mills and government services in a one-day strike against the labor bill. The unions also banned overtime work and have threatened civil disobedience unless the bill is withdrawn.    Unions and business executives are disturbed by a planned Industrial Relations Council that can end strikes and lockouts and impose contract settlements without the consent of labor or management. Tom Fawkes, spokesman for the 250,000-member British Columbia Federation of Labor, says unions also oppose new restrictions on picketing and a proposal to allow unionized construction companies to establish nonunion operations.    But in an interview here in the provincial capital, Mr. Vander Zalm says the existing labor code &quot;has created an image that British Columbia isn't a good place, industrial relations-wise,&quot; a factor that he says contributes to a British Columbia jobless rate of 12%, well above the Canadian average of 9.1% or the U.S. rate of 6.3%.    He says the present code discourages investment by permitting picketing that can affect innocent third parties and by permitting workers who aren't on strike to refuse to handle goods produced by struck companies. The new council will prevent disruptions like a four-month strike against lumber mills last year, he says.    But Mark Thompson, a commerce professor at the University of British Columbia, says the new bill lacks a &quot;sense of balance&quot; because it weakens union power without giving anything in return to labor. W. Craig Riddell, an economics professor at the university, adds that the process of change has been &quot;badly handled,&quot; backing the government and the unions &quot;into corners that will be hard to get out of.&quot;    The business community is concerned too, though it supports many of Mr. Vander Zalm's labor initiatives. Oksana Exell of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says the new Industrial Relations Council creates &quot;too much government intervention.&quot; She adds, &quot;If he continues to give us this kind of poor government, then he'll be losing votes from his traditional, small-business base.&quot;    A veteran of nearly two decades of controversy as a municipal and provincial politician, Mr. Vander Zalm says he won't back down. &quot;I don't walk away from a challenge. I don't get scared off by pressure,&quot; he says.    Mr. Vander Zalm attributes his hardnosed attitude partly to his childhood in the Netherlands during World War II. &quot;You had to fend for yourself,&quot; he says.    After the war, his family emigrated to British Columbia and built a tulip-bulb sales business. After high school, Mr. Vander Zalm joined the business and developed a multi-million-dollar chain of retail gardening centers and a theme park.    In 1975 he entered the provincial cabinet after five years as mayor of Surrey, a Vancouver suburb. His reputation spread across Canada after he critized the country's two-language policies. He made headlines by obliquely referring to former Quebec Premier Rene Levesque as a &quot;frog&quot; while performing a satiric song at a party convention. After Mr. Levesque's separatist Parti Quebecois was elected in 1976, Mr. Vander Zalm said, &quot;It won't cost me any sleepless nights&quot; if Quebec separates from Canada.    Compared with the rest of Canada, politics are unusually polarized here. The Liberals and Progressive Conservatives, centrist parties that dominate Canadian politics, haven't any legislative seats. Although the next election could be four years away, the opposition, labor-oriented New Democrats hope to beat Mr. Vander Zalm with their relatively moderate leader, Michael Harcourt, a three-term Vancouver mayor. But Mr. Vander Zalm, who lost a city election to Mr. Harcourt in 1984, is confident his Social Credit Party will continue to govern, as it has for most of the past 35 years.    Although Mr. Vander Zalm's opinions endear him to many British Columbians, some see a little bit of Archie Bunker in him. As former Social Credit Premier William Bennett once remarked:    &quot;I don't need polls to tell me what the guy in the beer parlor is thinking. I just walk down the hall and talk to Vander Zalm.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
