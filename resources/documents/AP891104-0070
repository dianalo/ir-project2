Polls indicated no party would win amajority.   The leader in opinion polls, the conservative New Democracyparty, was hoping for its first clear-cut parliamentary victorysince it lost to the socialists led by former Premier AndreasPapandreou in 1981.   But the socialists and another party, the Communist-ledCoalition of the Left and Progress, were expected to get a sizeableshare of the vote and possibly deny New Democracy a majority.   In such a case, difficult negotiations would open among thethree main parties, which have widely differing political views.Some feared the country could face several more months of politicalgridlock.   The day before the election, Greeks followed the tradition ofreturning to the towns where they grew up to vote. Police saidabout 500,000 people had left the capital of nearly 4 millionpeople by noon and that 22 people had died in traffic accidentsnationwide.   Extra airline flights were scheduled and ships ferried voters tothe islands. Voting is compulsory.   Campaigning ended Friday night to allow voters the usual ``dayof reflection'' before balloting.   In the last national elections in June, New Democracy finishedfirst but failed to gain a majority of the 300 seats in theone-chamber Parliament.   The conservatives formed an unprecedented alliance with theCommunist-led Coalition to end Papandreou's 8-year-old government.   The alliance assigned itself a mandate of investigating chargesof corruption in the former government, and it resigned in earlyOctober after indicting the charismatic Papandreou and five formerministers.   Papandreou, 70, was indicted on charges of authorizingwidespread telephone wiretaps while in office and of complicity inthe embezzling of $210 million from a private bank.   The left-right alliance did not address foreign policy issuesand left many other major governmental issues on the back burner,where they might stay for several more months if Sunday's electionsproduce no clear winner.   The Communist-led coalition has said it will not work again withthe conservatives and will only form a coalition with Papandreou'sPanhellenic Socialist Movement if Papandreou resigns as head of theparty he created.   Papandreou, who became famous for his criticism of the UnitedStates and support for Third World causes, has said he will notresign. The former premier still enjoys considerable support forthe leftist domestic programs he introduced.   The respected EURODIM polling firm released results Fridayshowing a slight increase in support for New Democracy andPapandreou's party, known as PASOK, since the June elections.   The poll indicated New Democracy would get 46 percent of thevote and PASOK about 40 percent, with the rest going to theCoalition, smaller parties and independents.   It showed the Coalition dropping slightly from the 13 percent itgained in June.   The simple proportional voting system makes it difficult forlarge parties to gain an overall majority but helps small partiesenter Parliament.   The indications that New Democracy might fall just short of itstarget raised the possibility of yet another set of elections.   But the party's leader, Constantine Mitsotakis, told the Flashcommercial radio station Friday he would try to form a governmenteven if deprived of a majority. He did not indicate whose supporthe would draw on.   Mitsotakis, 71, advocates closer ties with the West and asmaller government role in the economy.</TEXT></DOC>
