But while most ordinary shareholders are still licking their wounds, the executive-suite elite are recouping fast -- in their paychecks, even if not in their portfolios.    Though not quite rock-star rich, they're the richest hired hands in history. And even without extraordinary gains from stock options, the chances are greater than ever today that just one year's salary and bonus will make a corporate chief executive a millionaire -- or more. Some CEO pay packages last year: $1.5 million for Charles F. Knight of Emerson Electric Co., $2.3 million for Martin S. Davis of Gulf andamp; Western Inc. and $6.7 million for Michael D. Eisner of Walt Disney Co.    What's more, CEOs' pay is topping just about every economic benchmark. It's rising faster than that of their white-collar spear carriers and blue-collar workers, faster than inflation, faster than profits.    Over the 10 years ended in 1987, according to a study by Sibson andamp; Co., chief-executive salaries and bonuses alone grew 12.2% annually. Meanwhile, the compensation-consultant firm found, hourly workers' wages rose only 6.1% annually, inflation 6.5% and profits a mere 0.75%.    Last year, Sibson says, chief executives' salaries and bonuses increased 11.5%, while salaries of all other white-collar employees rose only 5.5%. This year, the disparity will widen: CEO pay is expected to rise about 11.5%, more than double the 5.2% average merit increase being budgeted for middle managers.    All the money appalls some people. &quot;The executive-compensation system has no coherence, makes no sense, and, at a time when there's a requirement for violent restructuring in companies, has a very negative impact,&quot; says Thomas J. Peters, a consultant and co-author of &quot;In Search of Excellence.&quot; He adds:   &quot;I'm swayed by one Japanese practice -- in hard times management takes the hit first, and then the workers. {Here}, in general, management doesn't take the same hit that the work force does -- which is a total disgrace. You can't say there's anything else than grotesque inequity.&quot;    Many executives, of course, limit themselves to modest compensation increases. And with bonuses tied to company performance, some executives do find austerity thrust upon them in hard times. During the auto industry slump in the early 1980s, top officers' bonuses shrank.    Last year's stock-market crash is expected to have a similar effect on bonuses in the securities industry. An indication of the trend: Bonuses of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. top executives plunged last year. And John H. Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Inc., said he wouldn't take a bonus for 1987, drawing only his $300,000 salary and $800,000 in deferred compensation for 1984. His $3.2 million compensation in 1986, including a bonus, made him one of the highest-paid executives on Wall Street.    Despite such fluctuations, however, many contend that the general trend is to continually sweeten executive pay packages. Jude Rich, Sibson's president, comments: &quot;The problem with executive-compensation management is that it's always a one-way street. It's always headed in the direction of executives' pocketbooks.&quot;    But defenders of corporate generosity contend that Adam Smith's invisible hand, guided by supply and demand in the labor market, equitably signs everybody's paycheck. &quot;I am of the opinion, until proven otherwise, that the market is competitive,&quot; says Robert Topel, a professor at the University of Chicago's business school. &quot;Competition is going to dictate what people make. The best measure we have of the value of what someone produces is what he was paid.&quot;    Even after the stock-market crash, gains on many stock options, granted years ago at prices far lower than today's stock quotes, haven't been wiped out. Look what happened to Mr. Eisner, who was granted options on two million Disney shares over a six-year period ending in 1990: Although the value of his options dropped about $45 million in the crash, they would still be worth about $93 million at today's prices.    Two tactics unavailable to the average employee are being widely used to insulate top executives from stock-market risks.    One tactic: de-emphasizing stock plans adopted during the bull market in favor of plans that pay cold cash. This year, some boards will pay big annual bonuses as a kind of consolation prize for the stock values lost in the crash, predicts Michael Emig, a principal in Wyatt Co., a consulting firm. In so doing, they will be following a dictum that almost no one acknowledges but many boards follow: Stock price reflects chief executives' performance only if the market is rising. If it's flat or falling, Mr. Emig says, they argue that &quot;the stock market is beyond our control.&quot;    Another tactic: canceling stock options issued at the peak of the market and reissuing them at new, lower, profit-enhancing prices. Steve Gross, a consultant at Hay Group in Philadelphia, says a client, a high-tech defense company, recently canceled and reissued options at two-thirds their pre-crash peak.    Superstar stock gains -- like the $5.6 million that John J. Nevin, chief executive at Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co., and the $18 million that Lee Iacocca, Chrysler Corp.'s CEO, earned two years ago -- seem improbable in this year's stock market. But even without such windfalls, the average CEO is a lot better off than he used to be.    In 1974, when Fortune magazine profiled the Harvard Business School class of 1949, it headlined its article &quot;The Class the Dollars Fell On.&quot; For the 275-plus chief executive and chief operating officers among the 621 classmates who could be located 25 years later, the average salary and bonus totaled less than $100,000. Adjusted for inflation, that's still less than half the $595,000 in salary and bonus that Sibson says is showered on the average chief executive today. For $1 billion companies, the average is $855,000.    Last year, Business Week magazine's annual survey of CEO pay listed 87 executives whose salary and bonus totaled $1 million or more. Five years earlier, only 14 made the list (five at just-restructured Phibro Corp.). This year, compensation consultants predict, salaries and bonuses will create even more millionaire CEOs.    Foreign companies pay far less. Towers Perrin says that even after the slump in the dollar, the American chief executive earns about 40% more than one in Japan, over twice as much as one in Great Britain and about 3 1/2 times as much as one in Australia. The consulting firm adds that American chief executives, on the average, earn 14 times as much as entry-level college graduates in their companies. In Japan, the figure is 10 times as much; in Britain, it's 11 times as much, and in Australia, it's only four times as much.    Such pay disparities and the spectacle of lavishly compensated U.S. executives ordering cutbacks, layoffs and general corporate austerity for everyone else are beginning to rankle employees, small investors and unions. Some observers fear that the dismay will sabotage restructured companies' efforts to improve operations.    &quot;Unions we have rarely dealt with are coming to us and saying, 'Holy cow, if we are told our compensation is too high relative to Japanese workers, why isn't this true of our senior managers as well?'&quot; says Lance Berger, a Hay consultant.    &quot;Nonsense,&quot; retorts Mr. Nevin at Firestone, whose shareholders are being asked to approve an acquisition by a Japanese company, Bridgestone Corp. &quot;Japanese executives have million-dollar country clubs, apartments in Hawaii and New York. They get all kinds of benefits that never show up in their paychecks.&quot; Others note that European executives receive similar noncash perks as a cushion against high taxes.    In any event, little change seems imminent. The people who make the decisions -- directors and big institutional investors -- seem prepared to keep the money flowing to the top so long as the return to shareholders is deemed adequate. &quot;What this country has is the shareholder syndrome,&quot; says Donald Frey, the chairman of Bell andamp; Howell Co. He believes that the current trend is to satisfy the shareholders in preference to other groups such as managers and employees.    To defuse criticism, many companies -- about 70% of those on the Fortune list of 500 industrial giants -- have embraced pay-for-performance programs that link executive pay to shareholder returns.    The programs are good public relations. &quot;It's hard to be against plans that are tied in with the shareholder making out well,&quot; says John B. Neff, portfolio manager of the $5.1 billion Windsor Fund. But not everyone is impressed. &quot;Why should the CEO be treated as a piece worker in 1875?&quot; asks Mr. Peters, the consultant. The programs are almost always additions to rather than substitutes for other compensation, and they almost always lift total pay simply because they're ladled like gravy on top of base salaries, bonuses and other fixed benefits.    Just how the gravy is concocted varies. Under the program at Reebok International Ltd., Paul Fireman, the chief executive, is paid 5% of the footwear company's pretax profits in excess of $20 million a year. Chrysler's plan sets quality, productivity, market share and profitability goals.    And &quot;performance&quot; in the CEO biz needn't be strictly defined. When Richard Ferris resigned as Allegis Corp.'s chairman last year in a strategy dispute with the board, he left with a promise of five years' salary and bonus payments, a promise worth nearly $3 million.    Some companies simply ignore the performance issue. When CBS Inc. ousted Thomas H. Wyman as chairman in September 1986, it paid him $1.1 million in salary and bonus for the whole year. It also gave him a lump-sum payment of $2.8 million and a pledge of $400,000 a year for life. The quality -- good or bad -- of his stewardship was irrelevant; CBS said it had to settle &quot;obligations&quot; to him.    Some plans go even further-beyond the grave. Reebok's Mr. Fireman is entitled to his full annual bonus ($12.7 million in 1986) even in the year he dies.    The market-forces camp says that talent is so costly because business today -- roiling with mergers, turnarounds and retrenchments -- is a high-risk arena and that high risk demands high rewards. These people also argue that the competition for executives is keen. People at the chief-executive level are in short supply, they contend, partly because of low birthrates during the Depression. Many companies say they must pay their chief executives handsomely lest others lure them away.    &quot;What they're really saying is, 'My CEO is really great, and I want to lock him in. No amount of money is worth losing him,'&quot; Sibson's Mr. Rich says.    Many directors agree. Roy E. Disney, who owns 2.54% of Walt Disney stock and is vice chairman, counts himself among those &quot;delighted&quot; that Walt Disney's stock and its top executives are doing so well. &quot;These are the best guys to run the company, and they're worth what we pay them,&quot; he says.    But the decisions on what to pay executives sometimes seem to be reached rather casually. Graef Crystal, a consultant, recalls sitting dumbfounded at a board meeting while the chief executive's pay was being considered. As Mr. Crystal remembers it, &quot;The compensation committee said, 'He's doing a super job, so why don't we give him some restricted stock?' One director said, 'Let's give him 100,000 shares.' Another said: '125,000.' And another said: '150,000,' and the bidding was over. These guys couldn't multiply even somewhat. They had just given him $7.5 million.&quot;    Naysaying in this atmosphere is difficult. &quot;There's still a lot of pressure to go along,&quot; says Mr. Frey of Bell andamp; Howell, who sits on the boards of Cincinnati Milacron Inc. and Springs Industries Inc., among others. &quot;It's a very peculiar sociological dynamic. It's an old boys' club.&quot;    Company pride is also at stake. The widespread practice of &quot;benchmarking,&quot; whereby compensation committees compare their executives' pay with that at likesized companies, is often blamed for upping the ante across the board. Companies all try to outdo the average, and so the average spirals upward.    The businessman-as-celebrity syndrome also comes into play. At a Chrysler press conference, Mr. Iacocca was asked about his eye-popping pay package. &quot;That's the American way,&quot; he retorted. &quot;If little kids don't aspire to make money like I did, what the hell good is this country? You gotta give them a role model, right?&quot;    Often, sheer ego is at work. &quot;There is always a great deal of interest in who made what,&quot; says J.B. Fuqua, the chairman of Fuqua Industries Inc. &quot;It becomes cocktail-party chatter. It's a measure of achievement to be on a magazine cover. They {chief executives} are proud of it.&quot;    Some suggest that the pay inflation has been partly unintentional. Noting the intricacy of today's compensation packages, Mr. Crystal, the consultant, says: &quot;I don't suggest they're stupid, these outside directors, but they don't give much time to their work. When you get into very complex plans, it's like talking to Greek statues. Their eyes roll back into their heads.&quot;    As some see it, most such pay is trifling. Robert Bogart, a senior vice president at Primerica Corp., says, &quot;A million dollars is peanuts compared to a billion for an acquisition.&quot;    Many ordinary employees, however, take a more jaundiced view. In an NBC News-Wall Street Journal telephone survey of 1,544 people late last year, 28% said they thought their own chief executives were overpaid, 44% said they were paid about the right amount, and 12% said they were paid too little. Asked about executive salaries in general, 60% said too high, 27% said about right, and 3% said too low.    Last year, Time Inc. employees angrily passed around a page of data drawn from the company's proxy statement. It showed compensation between 1984 and 1986 of $3.5 million to $5.4 million for senior executives such as Henry Grunwald, former editor-in-chief, and J. Richard Munro, chairman and chief executive. The arrangements were disclosed while Time magazine was shrinking its staff.    At Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s annual meeting last year, a former general manager of the company's Bethlehem, Pa., plant stood up to challenge a supplementary retirement plan that guarantees pensions for senior officers. Speaking on behalf of a group of middle managers who had taken early retirement in corporate cutbacks, he worried about the fate of other pensions -- including his own -- should the troubled company file for bankruptcy protection. &quot;It's like giving lifeboats to officers on the Titanic,&quot; he said.    A Bethlehem spokesman says those plans, which were established several years ago, are designed to &quot;retain and motivate key executives.&quot;    Some executives seem defensive -- even sheepish -- about their pay. Many companies closely guard details of compensation plans. Citing competitive reasons, Chrysler spokeswoman Taggarty Patrick says, &quot;If I tell you, I'm telling Ford, GM and everyone else.&quot; Says Primerica's Mr. Bogart, &quot;It's not something we want the public to read about.&quot; That includes shareholders, who vote on stock-option plans but rarely are told how the figures are decided.    Mr. Nevin spent more than half his time at Firestone's annual meeting last year explaining his $5.6 million bonus. His public-relations man later conceded, &quot;I think we may have come off a little defensive.&quot;    And Mr. Fuqua actually returned $1.5 million of his $4 million compensation for last year. In making similar gestures in years past, he has indicated that he didn't want to appear greedy. But his ownership of about 7% of the company's stock eases the pain of the largess. &quot;I'm a very wealthy man,&quot; he says.    ---            Shareholders Make a Difference   All these people have responsible jobs, large numbers of employees to manage, big annual budgets and a high public profile. By corporate standards, their salaries are low. Why? They earn no profits, in the conventional sense, and they have no shareholders to enrich.
