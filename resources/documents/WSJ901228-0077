For years, a fierce public debate raged over whetherthe proper course of care -- keeping her alive with feedingmachinery or withdrawing it -- was moral, humane, ethical orlegal. The case was brought before a series of courts,including the U.S. Supreme Court. For us, this is the keyrevelation of the Cruzan story -- that judges and only judgessettled it.   No one would deny that the plight of a Nancy Cruzan, andmany other hopelessly ill people, raises difficult questionsof morality and conscience. And maybe there was a time, nowgone, when these questions would be resolved by a family, itsdoctor and its clergyman. However the matter was resolved,life would go on for that family, as it would for otherfamilies as they passed through these periods of seeminglyunbearable distress. But no more.</LP><TEXT>   In America now, nothing is allowed to be merely personal.Instead, it is a matter of &quot;policy&quot; that simply must be&quot;debated&quot; at great length in public, no matter how grotesqueor obscene the spectacle of conducting such business aroundthe bent form of a woman in a vegetative state.   Fifty cents sometimes lets you call a TV station to votethumbs up or down on who gets the kids, whether Nancy Cruzanlives, whether the whale dies. Conferences are routinely heldaround such issues now, with the participants boarding planesto fly for hours to cities and spend several nights in ahotel to argue from morning until late afternoon about theethics of such cases. The discussion at these events is ofteninteresting, too. Quite interesting.   But in our country, talk, no matter how well argued, istaken by the combatants to be merely talk. What they want isa law or a judgment. They want a judge to use his authorityto posit a right, and &quot;settle&quot; the debate. And indeed, inJune, the Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that a citizen has a&quot;right to die.&quot; But being jurists rather than high priests,the Justices also ruled that the Cruzan family hadn't metMissouri's &quot;heightened evidentiary standards,&quot; therebyrequiring a succession of legal interventions andcounter-interventions by &quot;right to life&quot; advocates, before aMissouri judge finally ruled that it was OK to stop thefeeding machine.   In his concurrence to the Cruzan decision, Justice Scaliawarned that the Court &quot;will destroy itself&quot; if it continuesto take up controversies wherever human irrationality andoppression may theoretically occur. We would take JusticeScalia's warning to its corollary: This society will damageits civil cohesion if it insists on making judges arbiters ofdisputes that should be matters mainly of morality mediatedby conscience.   One might answer that what could be called the &quot;commonconscience&quot; of American society about such matters has beendivided in our time. That is true, but our apparent inabilityto reform a common conscience to any degree without resort tolawsuits at leasts suggests the decline of institutions thatonce helped individuals find their way.   We particularly have in mind the organized churches andtheir administrators and teachers, who essentially decidedduring the past 20 years that people could fend forthemselves on matters of personal morality while the churchesjoined the &quot;struggle&quot; to establish social &quot;rights&quot; whoseimprimatur comes from the courts, America's unique bishopric.   About 350 years ago, when the affairs of dying at the endof one's life were better understood, John Donne asked: &quot;Whatis so intricate, so entangling as death? Who ever got out ofa winding sheet?&quot; Nancy Cruzan, entangled eight years inpublicity, is now in peace. As a society we somehow have torediscover what we already know as individuals and families-- that death's intricacies are beyond the grasp of codes orjudges.</TEXT></DOC>
