The decision marked an aggressive turn in Japan's trade-negotiation strategy. Never in its 33 years as a member of GATT, the Geneva-based organization that oversees world trade, has it made such a request. An EC spokesman in Brussels said it wouldn't oppose formation of the panel. Its consent is required.    The EC last year began imposing heavy anti-dumping duties on numerous products assembled by Japanese manufactuers in Europe, using mostly imported Japanese parts. Japan contends the penalties contravene GATT law, which states that local subsidiaries of foreign companies must be treated the same as their domestic counterparts. Dumping occurs when a product is sold in a foreign market at a price lower than the domestic price.    Last week, the European Court of Justice, which rules on matters of EC law, rejected a complaint by Japanese companies that the EC Commission used faulty accounting methods in anti-dumping cases. </TEXT></DOC>
