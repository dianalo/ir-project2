Now the No. 2 producer in OPEC again, following Iraq'selimination as a contender during the Persian Gulf crisis,Iran already has proved that its expanding role is beingtaken seriously by the other exporters.</LP><TEXT>   That was underscored by the large number of OPECdelegations -- including seven of the group's 13 oilministers -- that came to Iran last week to participate in anunprecedented oil and gas conference at Isfahan. Among themwas Hisham Nazer, the first oil minister from Saudi Arabia tovisit Iran in 12 years. Also, Mr. Nazer and the otherministers at Isfahan gave strong support to the conference'smain theme: producer-consumer talks that could lead to a newstability in the oil market.   Iran's strengthening OPEC position likely will bereflected as the oil ministers open their midyear conferencetomorrow in Vienna. As a result, there are doubts that therewill be any change in OPEC's production ceiling for the thirdquarter, even though some ministers will argue that outputshould be increased because oil demand probably will behigher than previously projected.   OPEC's own economists have revised their previous demandprojections upward by about 500,000 barrels a day for 1991,and some oil ministers think the ceiling ought to be raisedby that amount to accommodate an expected resumption of someoil exports from Iraq and Kuwait in the second half of theyear.   In its meeting last week, OPEC's Economic Commission Boardconcluded that oil demand outside the so-called centrallyplanned economies will average 52.2 million barrels a daythis year, up from 51.8 million last year. The need for OPECoil, including adjustments to world oil inventories, isexpected to average 23 million barrels a day, up from 22.6million in 1990. Second-quarter production is estimated at22.3 million barrels a day, equal to the current ceiling, butMay production has shown signs of dropping below that level.   Still, several leading exporters, including Iran, suggestmore work is needed to balance supply with demand and advancethe price of oil toward OPEC's reference of $21 a barrel.&quot;The present ceiling only justifies a price range of $16 to$18,&quot; Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, said in aninterview. &quot;We have to be extremely cautious in the thirdquarter,&quot; he said. &quot;Otherwise, prices will crash.&quot;   Mr. Aghazadeh wasn't specific on what ceiling he wouldlike for the third quarter. But after discussions with him atIsfahan, Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, said thatleaving the ceiling at 22.3 million barrels would be apreferred option. &quot;It's the least traumatic and my choice,&quot;he said.   In addition to the production ceiling, the oil ministerswill consider several other matters, including the electionof a new president. A leading candidate is Celestino Armas ofVenezuela.   Iraq has sent a delegation for the first time in severalmeetings. And there is always the possibility thatcontroversies could erupt. But most of the ministers expectthe meeting to be uneventful.   &quot;It will be rather smooth and quick,&quot; said GinandjarKartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister.</TEXT></DOC>
