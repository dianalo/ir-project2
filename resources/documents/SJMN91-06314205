But the confrontationbetween the son and the prosecutor marked another unexpected twist in analready strange case.;   Liroff said he explained the deal to Robert Wildeweeks ago.;   &quot;He's obviously under a lot of pressure, and I don't think heunderstands,&quot; the prosecutor said. &quot;I feel very sorry for him. I know he'supset.&quot;;   But according to Wilde: &quot;The bottom line is -- this guy's gettingaway with murder. It's extremely difficult to take.&quot;;   Sjonborg, a former SanJose attorney, beat Phyllis Wilde to death in the bedroom of her Santa Clarahome in 1988. Authorities say he killed Wilde because she discovered thatSjonborg had stolen $5,400 out of a court settlement he had obtained on herbehalf.;   Feared disbarment;   According to the prosecution, Sjonborg wasafraid Wilde would have him disbarred.;   Sjonborg covered his tracks fornearly three years, until his estranged wife called police from Arizona thisfall and recanted the alibi she had previously given him. The lawyer's wife,Therese Schleizer, decided to change her story after Sjonborg broke into herhome and beat her 20-year-old niece with a wooden board.;   For that assault,the 40-year-old Sjonborg was sentenced to 29 years in an Arizona prison. Heagreed to admit killing Wilde after Santa Clara County prosecutors promisednot to charge him with first-degree murder.;   Wilde's son said he thoughtSjonborg would have to complete one state's sentence before doing time in thesecond state -- meaning he would spend at least 45 years in prison.;   Underthe plea bargain announced Friday in Santa Clara Municipal Court, Sjonborg canserve the two sentences simultaneously. That means he may serve a much shortersentence, although the actual number of years will be determined by prisonauthorities in each state.;   Prosecutors say they made the agreement becausethey feared they would not be able to get a conviction without Sjonborg'sconfession. &quot;The case just wasn't that strong,&quot; said Liroff, who added that hehad only circumstantial evidence.;   Wilde said he was particularly upset thatSjonborg got a stiffer sentence in Arizona for a lesser crime. Liroff blamedthat on the different sentencing laws enacted by each state.;   Sjonborg willbe formally sentenced next month in Santa Clara County Superior Court.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BRANDON BAILEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  496  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, November 9, 199100314205,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
