He said that after Bush was named head of the drug interdictiontask force in 1983, ``he did so badly that the head of the DrugEnforcement Agency called for abolishment'' of the program.   ``On George Bush's watch, the international production of drugs,the flow of drugs into this country and the use of drugs allincreased dramatically,'' he said.   Bentsen criticized plans by Republican nominee Bush to have hisvice presidential running mate, Dan Quayle, head a new anti-drugeffort. In a recent newspaper interview, a reporter had to informQuayle that Bush had directed the Reagan administration's efforts.   ``Now he wants to pass the torch of incompetence on to thejunior senator from Indiana who is so disinterested that he didn'teven know that his running mate had been head,'' Bentsen said.   ``The fact is, this administration has botched the war ondrugs,'' he said. ``They're trying to fight that battle with eightCabinet officers, 26 federal agencies, but only one general _ andhis name is Noriega,'' referring to Panamanian leader ManuelNoriega who is under U.S. indictment for alleged drug trafficking.   Bentsen promised that a Dukakis administration would name oneperson to head the drug eradication effort and ``won't coddle drugdictators like Noriega.''   He needled the Bush campain for its ties to lobbyists.   ``Some of the top lieutenants of the vice president have beenaccepting hundreds of thousand of dollars as paid agents of foreigngovernments... under investigation today for drug trafficking,'' hesaid.   ``We'll cut off foreign aid to governments that refuse tocooperate with us in the war on drugs,'' said Bentsen, pledgingincreased support for federal anti-drug agencies and morecoordination with local law enforcement officials.   The Reagan administration has ``tried to slash funds to assiststate and local governments in their drug enforcement efforts,'' hesaid.   ``The unprecedented influx of drugs has turned California'syouth gangs into heavily armed, well organized, deadly criminalcartels,'' said Bentsen, who earlier visited a Los Angeles areaplagued by gang warfare.   Accompanied by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Bentsen viewedknives, guns and a bullet-ridden car as he toured the Carson areawhere the Los Angeles County sheriff's office is running anOperation Safe Streets program.   Just hours earlier, four people standing in a crowd were shotfrom a passing car in what the sheriff's office said was a gangincident.   ``When we talk about waging this war, we have a lot more todo,'' Bentsen said before he was shown military-type assaultweapons, sawed-off shotguns and the other weapons confiscated inthe area.   As for gun control laws, Bentsen said, ``I think a waitingperiod for the purchase of handguns is a reasonable limitation.''He added that he preferred this be done at a state's option,indicating he might oppose pending legislation that would impose anational waiting period.   Bentsen was making his third trip to California since receivingthe vice presidential nomination in July. He and Democraticpresidential candidate Michael Dukakis are planning several returntrips in a bid for the state's 47 electoral votes, the most of anystate.      sk</TEXT></DOC>
