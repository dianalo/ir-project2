Hardly.andP;  In allour memory and processor benchmark tests, the Step 386is performed close tothe head of the class.andP;  Only ALR's 386SX offerings with the benefit ofcaching were able to beat out the Step 386is in processor tests.andP;  This wasthe fastest machine we tested on our Conventional Memory benchmark test.andM;To speed things up even more, two utilities are included with the basicmodel: EDISK, which creates a RAMdisk, and QuickSTEP, a disk caching utility.andM;Our evaluation unit came equipped with a fast 160MB ESDI Wren hard disk andcontroller manufactured by Control Data Corp.andP;  The Wren hard disk proved tobe the fastest in our large-record DOS File Access test and BIOS Disk Seektests, and it placed second only to the NEC PowerMate SX in handling smallrecords.andP;  A 1.2MB floppy disk drive from TEAC sits in the top drive bay.andM;The dark cloud in the performance of our Step 386is evaluation unit was thegraphics.andP;  Everex doesn't offer VGA graphics, so the unit was shipped withEverex's Micro Enhancer Deluxe EGA card and Evervision EGA monitor.andP;  It's notsurprising that this system was slow in PC Labs' video benchmark tests.andP;  Weare somewhat surprised that it wasn't the slowest.andP;  After looking at all theVGA displays, we found it difficult to get excited about EGA.andM;The manual accompanying the Everex Step 386is does a good job of covering allaspects of operation and clearly outlines the steps to be taken to upgradethe system.andP;  It also includes a helpful glossary, table of contents, andindex.andP;  If you're looking for fast 386SX performance, look at Everex.andO;Although the list price may at first seem intimidating, persevere and yourdealer may be able to offer the system at a fraction of the price.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
