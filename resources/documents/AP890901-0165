OscarBotero told a news conference.   Late Friday, both the U.S. Embassy and the Defense Ministrydenied there were any U.S. military advisers in Colombia.   The Pentagon said Thursday up to 200 American military personnelcould wind up in Colombia for tasks ranging from unloading totraining.   A U.S. narcotics official said drug traffickers wanted in theUnited States have managed to avoid a government crackdown andremain in Colombia because of corruption among Colombian authorities.   Authorities in Medellin, home of the most powerful cocainecartel, said police defused a 40-pound bomb that was left at a bankFriday by terror squads working for drug lords.   It was the latest development in a series of assassinations,bombings and arson by the drug cartels in the past two weeks. Druglords are trying to force the government to reverse its decision tobegin extraditing suspects wanted by the United States.   The U.S. Justice Department seeks extraditions of 12 Colombiansbelieved to be key figures in cartels that supply most of thecocaine sold in the United States.   Botero said the Colombian army was capable of handling the $65million worth of equipment being sent by the United States withoutthe aid of 200 advisers, but did not rule out requesting technicalhelp in ``specific fields.''   He said the best aid the United States and other wealthy nationscould give would be reducing drug use among their populations.   The general said 2,004 properties had been searched, 550 estatesseized, 1,061 weapons found and 1,356 cars, 33 yachts, 142motorcycles and 349 aircraft confiscated.   Colombia began its toughest crackdown on drug dealing after theleading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, wasassassinated Aug. 18 during a speech at a campaign rally. Drug lordsresponded to the crackdown with threats to kill more officials.   U.S. authorities said they believe corruption is slowing thecrackdown and that drug chieftains remain in Colombia, protected bysome officials, despite speculation that narcotics overlords mayhave fled the country.   ``I feel confident most of these people are in Colombia,'' theU.S. narcotics official said of traffickers sought by the UnitedStates.   Traffickers eluding arrest ``don't feel a threat. They might evenfeel protected,'' he said.   ``Infiltration is a very serious factor,'' the official said ofattempts by the traffickers to bribe Colombian government officialsand members of government security forces.   The official said drug cartels may have people stationed in smalltowns watching only for military or police movement. Army colonelscan make up to $15,000 monthly working for drug dealers.   The narcotics official spoke with reporters on the condition thathis name or title not be disclosed.   The meeting with journalists was initiated by the U.S. Embassy,perhaps indicating concern among U.S. officials that Colombia's drugfight may be waning.   Embassy officials said they had no information about U.S.advisers coming to Colombia to aid Colombian security forces inusing $65 million pledged by President Bush.   Barco said Thursday the $65 million Bush offered for Colombia'swar on drugs was important but that the real solution is ``to putthe brakes on the demand.''   In drug raids, the Colombian army has found records in drugtraffickers' hideouts showing telephone calls to army bases andpolice stations. Arms caches have included police guns and equipmentand scores of police uniforms, apparently used as disguises.   The army and national police, which are part of the DefenseMinistry, have ousted about a dozen officers for drug trafficking orbeing on traffickers' payrolls.   The U.S. narcotics official said he did not know how high up inthe government the corruption goes.   ``If the Colombian people do not win this battle, I pity whatwill happen to this country,'' the official said.   Asked if he thought the battle would get more intense, he said,``There is no doubt in my mind there will be a great deal ofbloodshed.''   He said the traffickers will kill their adversaries one by one ifthey defeat the current crackdown. Even President Virgilio Barcocould be assassinated, he said.   Barco said Thursday on Colombia was ``doing its duty'' in theanti-drug fight and called on developed countries to stop cocaineuse.   The U.S. official said the Colombian Supreme Court will determinemuch of the success or failure of the crackdown.   The Supreme Court eventually will rule on the constitutionalityof Barco's decree to extradite Colombians to the United States undera state of seige that exists.   In the last year the court has declared unconstitutional five of10 Barco decrees aimed at controlling guerrilla violence and atthwarting drug traffickers.</TEXT></DOC>
