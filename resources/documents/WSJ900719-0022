In a statement yesterday, IBM said it is&quot;considering many options as it moves to sharpen itsstrategic focus,&quot; but the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant didn'tcomment directly on the newspaper story. IBM did say, though,that it &quot;hasn't concluded any transaction.&quot;   IBM also said any action &quot;would ensure that our employeesare treated fairly, that service to our customers isuninterrupted and that the transaction is in the besteconomic interest of our company.&quot;   Financial executives also said Clayton andamp; Dubilier may havelined up an equity partner to share in the acquisition.Clayton andamp; Dubilier reportedly sounded out General ElectricCapital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co., about buyingsome subordinated debt to help finance the transaction. GECapital declined to comment.   Several bankers said Clayton andamp; Dubilier's longtime leadbank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., is likely to organize bankloans for an IBM deal. The bankers cautioned that they hadn'tyet seen Clayton andamp; Dubilier's exact financing terms.Officials at Manufacturers didn't return phone calls.   People familiar with Clayton andamp; Dubilier said they expectthe firm will strive to meet IBM's concerns. Recent Clayton andamp;Dubilier acquisitions have let management and employees buy astake of about 25% in the post-buy-out company. Clayton andamp;Dubilier &quot;has made an effort to put equity ownership in thebroadest hands,&quot; an adviser to the buy-out firm said.   Clayton andamp; Dubilier also has tried to assure IBM that itsacquisitions generally don't involve the big asset sales andjob cuts that have soured the public image of buy-outs.Instead, Clayton andamp; Dubilier, led by its chairman, formerMcKinsey andamp; Co. consultant Martin Dubilier, has portrayeditself as a team of hands-on operating specialists, withideas on improving everything from a company's distributionsystem to its inventory control.   To date, Clayton andamp; Dubilier's largest acquisition has beenthe $1.16 billion purchase of Uniroyal Inc. in 1985.Recently, however, Clayton andamp; Dubilier has taken steps toincrease its buying power. It raised a $1 billion equity fundlast year from pension funds and other institutionalinvestors, triple the size of its previous fund. At the time,Clayton andamp; Dubilier said it wanted to &quot;participate intransactions . . . above the $1 billion level.&quot;   Several bankers said Clayton andamp; Dubilier's longtime leadbank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., is likely to organize bankloans for an IBM deal. The bankers cautioned that they hadn'tyet seen Clayton andamp; Dubilier's exact financing terms.Financial executives also said Clayton andamp; Dubilier is in talkswith General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of GeneralElectric Co., which is considering buying some subordinateddebt to help finance the transaction. Officials atManufacturers didn't return phone calls; General ElectricCapital declined comment.   The indicated purchase price of $2.5 billion to $3 billionwould appear to include other operations besides typewriters,keyboards and printers. Although IBM doesn't break outresults by individual product lines, its world-wide sales oftypewriters, keyboards and low-end printers are estimated atless than $2 billion. Given the relatively low margins onthose businesses, any purchase price would presumably come toless than the annual revenue.   IBM spent $350 million in the early 1980s to modernize andautomate its facility in Lexington, Ky., where more than4,000 employees build the products that are up for sale. Butit has apparently decided that it can't build the products asefficiently as competitors can.   IBM has been re-evaluating what businesses are central toits strategy and has been selling some marginal assets. Withpressure from competitors unabating, IBM has aggressively cutcosts, to the point of taking a $2.4 billion write-off inlast year's fourth quarter to cover the costs of cutting10,000 jobs and consolidating some plants.   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,IBM shares closed at $119.875, down 87.5 cents.   ---   Randall Smith contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
