In a 1989 letter excerpted below, Jonathan wrote to anAmerican rabbi from his cell that America would have to go towar against Iraq if we failed to prevent the completion ofchemical facilities that we knew were under construction. Howright he was.   -- Morris Pollard                                                                                                          ---   Dear Rabbi,   My name is Jonathan Pollard and I am currently serving alife sentence due to my activities on behalf of Israel.   Lest you labor under a false impression, Rabbi, I want tostate quite categorically that I do not consider myself to beabove the law. I fully appreciate the fact that I must bepunished for my activities, however justified I may have feltthem to be. That being said, I do not believe that thedraconian sentence meted out to me was in any waycommensurate with the crime which I committed. Nowhere in myindictment . . . was I ever described as a &quot;traitor,&quot; whichis hardly a surprise given the fact that the operation withwhich I was associated actually served to strengthenAmerica's long-term security interests in the Middle East.   Notwithstanding {then Defense Secretary Caspar}Weinberger's disingenous opinion, any objective examinationof the record will show that no American agent, facility orprogram was compromised as a result of my actions -- not one.But this salient fact was coveniently overlooked by Mr.Weinberger, who felt that I deserved the death penality forhaving had the audacity to make Israel &quot;too strong.&quot;   In retrospect, perhaps one of the worst things the Reaganadministration did to Israel during the course of our trialwas that it purposely distorted the nature of my activitiesin such a way so as to leave the impression that Israel hadsomehow become a threat to the national security of thiscountry. So by intent the subsequent sentence I received wasan arrow aimed directly at the heart of the U.S-Israel&quot;special relationship.&quot;   The case of Mr. and Mrs. Abdel Kader Helmy appears to beyet another instance where the political aspects of anespionage trial have been of paramount concern to thegovernment. As you'll recall, the Helmys are theEgyptian-born U.S. citizens who were accused last year offunneling highly sensitive ballistic missile technology totheir native land. At the time of his arrest on June 24,1988, {Mr.} Helmy was a senior propulsion engineer who held a&quot;secret&quot; level security clearance from the U.S. Department ofDefense. According to a 36-page affidavit filed by theCustoms Service. . . . U.S. customs agents searching {Mr.}Helmy's trash found handwritten notes outlining how to workwith carbon -- carbon fiber material, used in rocket nosecones and &quot;stealth&quot; aircraft . . .; instructions on buildingrocket exhaust nozzles; a description of an extremelysensitive microwave telemetry antenna; and a complete packageneeded to build or upgrade a tactical missile system.   Although there is no public evidence linking {Mr.} Helmydirectly with the Iraqis, intelligence sources have indicatedthat the Egyptians used {Mr.} Helmy's expertise to helpBaghdad modify its stockpile of Soviet-supplied Scud-Bballistic rockets. His principal responsibility, however, wasto ensure the success of an Egyptian-Iraqi missile programwhich had encountered some developmental problems. Code namedBADR 2000 by the Egyptians and SAAD-16 by the Iraqis, thisArgentine-designed weapon has an estimated range of 500-1,000miles, and, from what I've been told, figures prominently inArab strategic planning against Israel.   If one compares the way in which the government respondedto my affair with that of its soft-pedalling of the Helmycase, the existence of a double standard becomes apparent.Firstly, at the insistence of the State and Defensedepartments, all espionage-related charges against Mr. andMrs. Helmy have been quietly dropped. . . . {T}headministration has done everything it can to reduce thenotoriety of the Helmy affair.   The problem . . . lay in the fact that many of the photosI turned over to the Israelis were of a number of Iraqichemical weapons manufacturing plants which the Reaganadministration did not want to admit existed. Why? Well, ifno one knew about these facilities then the State and DefenseDepartments would have been spared the embarrassing task ofconfronting Iraq over its violation of the Geneva Protocol of1925, which banned the use of chemical weapons in war. Youhave to remember . . . that at the time of my sentencing themassacre of Kurdish civilians in Halabja had not yetoccurred, and what little public concern was being voicedover Iraq's apparent use of poison gas was largely ignored bythe administration, which did not want to anger the Arabworld by criticizing the employment of such barbaric weaponsagainst Iran. The photos I gave Israel, though, if&quot;compromised,&quot; would have jeopardized the administration'spolicy of callous indifference towards this issue, in thatthey constituted hard, irrefutable proof that Iraq was indeedengaged in the production and wide-scale use of chemicalweapons. What the administration was really concerned aboutwas being placed in a position where it would have to admitthat it had tacitly condoned the creation of an Iraqichemical weapons manufacturing capability.   Once the atrocity at Halabja had occurred, though, theWhite House was placed in a rather awkward position. On theone hand, the U.S. intelligence community did not want to beaccused of having failed to keep an eye on Iraq's burgeoningchemical weapons arsenal. Then again, the CIA . . . could notvery well confirm the existence of the Iraqi poison gasplants without running the risk of compromising the Reaganadministration's policy towards these facilities.   After a few days of &quot;soul searching,&quot; the State Departmentfinally admitted that the U.S. had intercepted some Iraqimilitary communications which indicated that lethal gas had,in fact, been employed against unarmed Kurdish civilians. TheIranians had astutely outmaneuvered them, though, and theissue had to be &quot;contained&quot; before it caused a rift inU.S.-Arab relations. Certainly, confirming the undeniableoperational employment of chemical munitions by the Iraqiswas far perferable to describing the exact dimension of theirpoison gas plants, which would have raised some uncomfortablequestions on Capitol Hill . . .   Thus, in an attempt to recapture the moral &quot;high ground,&quot;so to speak, from Iran, the White House evidently decidedthat it would be better for the U.S. to be seen as leadingthe public denunciation of Iraq rather than the AyatollahKhomeini. As it was, though, the administration still managedto salvage its standing in the Arab world by preventingCongress from imposing any punitive sanctions against Iraq.In essence, then, what I did by passing satellite photos ofthe Iraqi poison gas plants to Israel was endanger the Reaganadministration's pro-Saudi political agenda, not theintelligence community's &quot;sources and methods.&quot;   According to the prosecution, there were two reasons whythe government refused to tell Israel about Iraq's poison gasplants: 1) fear of compromising the KH-11 {intelligence}system, and 2) concern over the Israelis' probable reactiononce they recognized the threat these facilities posed totheir survival.   What the Israelis would actually have considered was apreventive attack on the Iraqi chemical-arms factories beforethey had become fully operational. Once they had comeon-line, you see, and the Iraqis had been able to dispersetheir arsenal of chemical munitions, these plants, like theones in Syria, would only have been attacked either in wartime, where the idea of a pre-emptive strike is valid, or ina clandestine sabotage campaign aimed at slowing theirproduction of poisons. This was the same reasoning, by theway, that lay behind the Reagan administration's desire tobomb the Rabta industrial complex before the Libyans had hadthe opportunity to complete its construction.   The crisis over the Rabta plant does beg the question,though: If the Reagan administration felt justified in itsdesire to eliminate what it perceived to be an impendingLibyan chemical threat to our national security, why was itso unwilling to grant Israel the same right of preventiveself-defense with regard to Iraq's poison gas manufacturingfacilities?   So what was I supposed to do? Let Israel fend for herself?If you think that is what I should have done, then how can wecondemn all those . . . who during the Second World Warconsciously participated in the abandonment of EuropeanJewry? Seriously, Rabbi, what would be the difference betweenwhat they did and a decision on my part to have kept silentabout the Iraqi poison gas threat to Israel? I'd rather berotting in prison than sitting shiva for the hundreds ofthousands of Israelis who could have died because of mycowardice.   Jonathan Pollard</TEXT></DOC>
