Officials of the U.S. company said the Philippine government isanti-nuclear and filed the suit for political reasons.   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez announced the 75-page suit wasfiled in the U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., againstWestinghouse, its subsidiary Westinghouse International ProjectsInc., and the contractors, Burns and Roe Enterprises Inc.   Westinghouse said Thursday that it petitioned the InternationalChamber of Commerce in Paris to arbitrate the dispute as provided bythe 1976 contract.   The $2.3 billion power plant, on the Bataan peninsula about 60miles west of the capital across Manila Bay, was completed threeyears ago in the final months of Marcos' 20-year rule.   Closing the Bataan plant was one of President Corazon Aquino'scampaign pledges during the 1986 presidential election againstMarcos. She charged the plant was unsafe and built on an earthquakefault.   Mrs. Aquino, who ousted Marcos in a civilian-backed militaryuprising in February 1986, ordered the 620-megawatt plant closedbefore it went into operation.   In a statement released Thursday, Mrs. Aquino said the governmentdecided to file suit because the contractors ``were not willing toagree to a fair commercial settlement.''   Ordonez said Mrs. Aquino has not decided whether to suspendinterest payments on construction loans pending completion oflitigation. The loans cost the debt-strapped government about$355,000 a day.   A copy of the suit received by the Associated Press statedWestinghouse paid some $17.3 million in ``kickbacks'' or commissionsto two companies owned by Herminio Disini, who is married to acousin of Marcos' wife, Imelda.   It also alleged that sub-contracts for the building of the plantwent to companies owned by Disini. Officials say they suspect someof the money went to Marcos.   The suit is aimed at voiding the contract and forcing the giantAmerican company to return at least part of the money thePhilippines paid for the plant.   ``The principal objective is to declare that there was bribery incontracting this project,'' Ordonez said of the lawsuit. ``It is nota politically motivated move. It is one that is calculated to obtainrelease for the Philippines, which has been victimized by an illegaltransaction.''   The Pittsburg-based Westinghouse has denied impropriety inpayments to Disini, saying the compensation complied with Philippineregulations.   Nathaniel D. Woodson, general manager of the Westinghouse nuclearfuels unit, and Louis J. Briskman, Westinghouse deputy generalcounsel, said Philippine officials have acknowledged during privatetalks that no matter how safe the plant is, they don't intend toallow nuclear power production in the country.   ``It has nothing to do with safety,'' Woodson said. ``What we'refinding here are the results of a political policy that came to lifewhen they were running for office,'' Woodson said. ``They now feelthey have a political albatross around their neck and they're tryingto blame us.''   ``Westinghouse will not be a scapegoat,'' he added.   Sen. Rene Saguisag, who was involved in efforts to seek anout-of-court settlement, said Marcos was not named in the suit toavoid complicating cases pending in the Philippines and the UnitedStates against the former president.   Marcos and his wife, who live in Hawaii, were indicted by afederal grand jury in October on racketeering charges. Marcos hasbeen named in 35 civil suits in the Philippines.</TEXT></DOC>
