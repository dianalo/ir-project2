<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-1153 </DOCNO><TEXT>The objective of this work has been to clarify the potential of, and identifymarkets for, ground heat stores in clay. The results are intended toserve as a basis for technology procurement of a number of heat supplysystems using heat pumps and ground heat stores. The report describesa model for technology procurement of ground heat stores, to be carriedout in a specification stage and a prototype stage. The specificationstage will be used to clarify certain basic characteristics, to preparean enquiry specification and to negotiate the first phase of the technicaldevelopment work. The prototype phase will be used to carry out technicaldevelopment, perform pilot trials and construct prototype installationsin full scale in various geological environments. Provided that commerciallyattractive cost levels can be achieved, this will then be followed bya series phase, with the objective of building about 10-15 such installations.After evaluation of tenders and joint negotiation, the various projectswill be carried out under individual contracts between the purchasersand suppliers/contractors.
