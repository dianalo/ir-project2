The latest figureson corporate profits, however, would seem to show an economystill deep in recession.   In the July-September period, net income of 631 majorcorporations fell 23% from a year earlier, a Wall StreetJournal survey shows. After-tax earnings from continuingoperations also dropped 23% in the quarter. In the secondquarter, net income had fallen 25% from a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   Hope springs eternal among analysts, though, and amajority expect improved profit numbers for the currentquarter. Some of the optimists go so far as to predictdouble-digit gains. One advantage is that the current quarterwill be compared with a weak fourth period in 1990, whenyear-to-year net income fell 9%. This year's third quarter,by contrast, suffered by comparison with the 1990 period,when net income rose 4%.   Throughout the third quarter, analysts had been expectingprofits to begin looking better, only to be disappointed asthe actual numbers came in. &quot;Corporate profits have bornemuch of the brunt of the latest recession,&quot; say theeconomists at First Interstate Bancorp., Los Angeles. Lowlevels of inflation and strong market competition have madeit difficult for companies to raise prices to widen profitmargins.   At the moment, profit margins hardly look encouraging. Ina survey conducted last month, the National Association ofBusiness Economists found 26.3% of the companies covered wereexperiencing rising profit margins, while margins at 35.8% ofthe companies were falling.   Most analysts nonetheless remain moderately optimisticabout the future. &quot;We believe that higher profits will be thecatalyst for growth in 1992,&quot; says H. Erich Heinemann, chiefeconomist of the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co.&quot;The rise in cash flow should trigger a surge in capitalspending next year.&quot; Analysts doubt that foreign trade willhelp profits much until late next year, at the earliest. TheU.S. appears to be pulling out of recession in advance of itstrading partners, which will limit U.S. exports and increaseAmerican imports. The analysts at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a researchfirm, also expect a weaker dollar to help U.S. exports inlate 1992.   Among major groups, third-quarter earnings improved forsecurities firms, and banks posted mixed results. Oilcompanies showed lower earnings and auto concerns were awashin red ink. Aerospace companies posted good operatingearnings.   The U.S. auto industry had a dismal quarter as hopes for alate-summer recovery dissipated amid falling consumerconfidence and uncertainty over job stability. The Big ThreeU.S. auto makers posted a combined net loss of $1.72 billion.Although Chrysler's loss was much less than expected, the BigThree still could be on their way to record annual deficits.Car and light-truck sales through the third quarter were12.5% lower than a year ago, and the Big Three's share of carsales alone dropped to 65%, from 67% a year ago.   The results were even more disappointing because GeneralMotors and Ford brought several new car models to marketduring the period. Ford's redesigned Taurus and GM's newPontiac Bonneville and Grand Am models, along with its BuickLeSabre, were expected to help the auto concerns regain someof their lost market share. Now, with consumer confidence atrecessionary levels, the prospects for a turnaround in thefourth quarter are dim.   Operating earnings were generally strong for aerospacecompanies, especially those with a concentration in defense.Although the military budget is shrinking and the futurelooks foreboding, cost-cutting efforts and write-offs takenlast year are helping to bolster results for now. McDonnellDouglas's year-ago net included a $234 million gain from thesettlement of pension-fund obligations, partially offset by a$58 million charge to reverse profits previously accrued onthe C-17 cargo plane program. The outlook remains much thesame through next year. But eventually, analysts warn,declining Pentagon spending probably will take its toll oncompany profits.   Results for most large banks were in line with or aboveexpectations, with the notable exception of several of thebiggest banks.   Citicorp, the nation's largest bank, suspended itsdividend and posted a loss that was primarily attributed to awrite-down of $400 million for its troubled Quotron unit andfor charges related to downsizing its operations. Most of thecharges resulted from costs associated with layoffs, promptedmainly by weaker-than-expected revenue from its core bankingbusinesses.   West Coast banks, including Security Pacific and WellsFargo, posted wider losses or sharp profit drops as theycontinued to be plagued by bad real estate loans. Both banksare expected to post high loan-loss provisions in the fourthquarter, resulting in a loss for Security Pacific and reducedearnings for Wells Fargo.   Nevertheless, most banks set aside less in provisions forpossible loan losses than in the year-earlier period. Thegenerally lower-than-expected provisions signaled that loanproblems may be stabilizing, some analysts said. That and theincreasing gap between the cost of funds and what bankscharge customers buoyed earnings. Both trends are expected tocontinue in the fourth quarter, helping to improve resultsfor many banks.   Oil earnings plunged because almost all sectors of thebusiness were weaker than last year. Crude oil prices were $4to $6 a barrel below last summer, when they were drivensharply higher by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Natural gasprices, in a slump because of oversupply, were also lower. Inaddition, gasoline refining and marketing margins were narrowbecause the weak economy has curbed demand. Petrochemicalprofits continued to be weak for the same reasons. Exxonbucked the trend as its refining and marketing operationsboosted earnings. Excluding special items, Mobil's profitwould have risen 47%, as foreign refining and marketing hadstrong results. Atlantic Richfield posted a loss as a resultof $340 million in one-time charges related to personnelreductions and writedowns on oil and gas properties newlyplaced on the block. Amoco had $75 million of charges in thelatest quarter for the closing of a refinery and a gain of$149 million a year earlier. Fourth-quarter fundamentalsaren't much better for the oil industry. Crude prices arestill well below year-earlier levels and chemicals remainweak. Natural gas prices are slightly higher but notsignificantly. Refining and marketing results vary fromcompany to company but generally the weak economy could keepdemand fairly low.   On Wall Street, securities firms posted their thirdconsecutive robust quarter -- the first time they have doneso since the 1987 stock-market crash.   The only major firm with a mediocre quarter was Salomon,which took a $200 million charge against earnings to pay forexpected fines and other court costs from itsTreasury-auction scandal. The firm would have posted a netloss, if not for a slashing of compensation expenses.   After years of trimming expenses since the crash, theslimmed-down Wall Street firms profited handsomely in thethird quarter from lower interest rates, a boom instock-and-bond underwriting and active trading markets.   Still, the year-to-year percentage improvement for mostfirms is misleadingly high, because the 1990 third quarterwas one of Wall Street's worst ever. Also, the third-quarterresults were slightly behind the previous quarter's at mostfirms, causing some analysts to predict that Wall Street'srebound is already cooling.   Profits at Merrill Lynch, the biggest U.S. brokerage firm,have already surpassed the full-year record of 1988. Merrilland other firms that cater to small investors, including A.G.Edwards, PaineWebber Group and Quick andamp; Reilly Group, sawsignificant gains from their &quot;retail&quot; brokerage operations asfalling interest rates prompted investors to turn to stocksand mutual funds.   &quot;If rates continue to be flat or come down, the equitymarkets will be OK&quot; and securities firms will profit, saysDonald Marron, PaineWebber chairman. But he warns: &quot;At somepoint, the economy has to start to improve, or else clearlythe momentum is going to slow down.&quot;   Here are the third-quarter profits for various industrygroups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter.

A major exception in the group was USX Corp.'s U.S. SteelGroup, which had a $55 million pension credit and actuallyhad a loss on an operating basis, albeit significantly lessthan in the first half. Meanwhile, losses at Bethlehem Steelwidened in the quarter from first-half levels, in large partbecause of massive equipment modernizations. Bethlehem saidit would post a fourth-quarter loss as well because ofongoing maintenance programs and intense price competition.Still, orders began to pick up in the quarter for the entireindustry and steel makers should benefit in the fourthquarter from a 4% price boost on flat-rolled steel effectivewith Sept. 29 shipments.   Specialty steelmakers and minimills fared better than themore competitive and commodity-based integrated steelmakers,which make carbon steel from raw materials. Allegheny Ludlum,which has a significant export business of its stainless andspecialty steels, managed a profit in spite of a charge of 10cents a share for a new state tax. Worthington Industriesreached record sales and earnings in its latest fiscalquarter as a result of its strong non-steel plastics businessand improvements in the steel casting operations, which lastyear suffered a strike. Minimill Nucor, while profitable,posted lower third-quarter earnings as shipments of steeldecks and production of steel joists slipped.   A vast oversupply caused by heavy Soviet exports andoverly zealous production in the West gouged aluminum makers'profits in the third quarter. Aluminum prices, at theirlowest levels in recent history, forced break-even resultsfor companies with high sensitivity to aluminum ingot andlow-margin aluminum products. Those with more emphasis onalumina and highly fabricated products, such as Aluminum Co.of America, or packaging, such as Reynolds Metals, faredslightly better. Aluminum prices rebounded modestly lastmonth (Oct.) after Alcan Aluminium announced plans to halt8.5% of its primary capacity. While that should help aluminummakers' results in the fourth quarter, more capacity must beremoved before aluminum makers see much improvement.   Most precious metals, industrial minerals and base metalsmining companies reported significantly lower earnings, thedirect result of lower metals and minerals prices.   Zinc, lead, copper and gold prices declined compared withthe year-earlier quarter, and molybdenum and silver pricesremained weak. Mining companies also reported demand declinedfor iron ore and coal.   Cleveland-Cliffs reported higher earnings, largely because1990 results were affected by a strike at two mines inMichigan from Aug. 1, 1990, to Dec. 1, 1990. The company alsosaid average selling prices of iron ore rose even thoughdemand fell.   Metals prices are expected to remain low through the endof the year, as the recession continues to damp industrialand construction demand for metals-based products. Copperprices, however, have remained stronger than most analystshad expected. Based on higher-than-anticipated Septemberprices, some companies are cautiously predicting that pricesmay continue to hover around $1 a pound, where most copperproducers can be profitable.   Timber companies and other tree-related concerns sawprofits chopped down again by persistently weak pulp andpaper prices and depressed housing starts.   Both conditions are related to the nation's feebleeconomic recovery, which has meant sluggish home building andweak demand for timber and lumber products, as well as wobblydemand for paper and pulp products. A brief surge inconstruction activity in the second quarter, which was fueledby post-Persian Gulf War euphoria and which had boosted someforest products companies' second-quarter results, ebbed inthe third quarter. Boise Cascade's loss included a net gainof $39 million from selling tim berlands and a $9.5 millioncharge related to a restructuring. Georgia-Pacific had a $12million charge related to a planned sale of certain assets.Federal Paper Board's profit increase reflected healthydemand for bleached paperboard, one of its main products,which hasn't suffered slumping prices. Louisiana Pacific'sprofit increase was from unusually depressed year-earlierlevels. Until the recovery picks up steam, paper and pulpprices and building material demand will remain underpressure, and lumber and paper company profits will suffer.   Profits for chemical companies that rely heavily oncommodity chemicals and plastics sales slid sharply inresponse to economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe.Overcapacity in many chemicals and plastics, combined withthe rising costs of petroleum-based raw materials, put anadditional squeeze on profit margins. Union Carbide took allof a previously announced cost-cutting charge of $121million, or 95 cents a share, in the third quarter, leavingit with a loss for the period. Several other companies tookcost-cutting charges in the second quarter. Expect more badnews from the industry for at least the rest of the year, oruntil the economy shows signs of a sustained rebound,analysts say. &quot;The fourth quarter will really be terrible,&quot;says Robert Reitzes, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence in NewYork. Exceptions to the trend are companies with most oftheir earnings coming from recession-resistant businessessuch as specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals and non-cyclicalconsumer products.

Manycompanies laid off workers and closed offices in response tothe lower level of activity and expectations that thesluggish pace will continue. The reason behind the drillingslowdown was the plunge in natural gas prices, which hit10-year lows over the summer. International drilling wasrelatively flat, so companies that could grab a share of theoverseas market had better performances.   Schlumberger said net rose because it continued to expandbusiness outside the U.S. But even some internationalmarkets, such as the North Sea, experienced oversupply, whichreduced prices of goods and services there. The outlook isfor more of the same in the fourth quarter. Internationaldrilling is expected to remain stable while few industryofficials predict any sizable increase in domestic activity.   Natural gas pipeline profits were generally higher,reflecting industry cost-cutting to cope with continuing lowgas prices. Panhandle Eastern said its turnaround to netincome, compared with a loss in the year-ago period, resultspartly from an early-retirement program and a rate increaseto customers. Panhandle Eastern is typical of many in thepipeline industry that increasingly transport gas owned byothers, instead of their own. &quot;More and more, the pipelinesare reducing their exposure to commodity prices by collectingtolls for shipping other peoples' gas,&quot; said Vinod Dar, a gasindustry consultant based in Washington, D.C. BurlingtonResources said that, like many in the industry, it improvedearnings by increasing production; the company said it soldmore gas than in the year-ago quarter despite the weak marketand it's continuing a cost-reduction strategy.   Despite improved profit in the quarter, prospects aren'tgood for much more of the same in the fourth quarter or earlynext year, analysts say. Gas prices are likely to continueweak because supplies are plentiful after a warm winter lastyear.   ---   OIL                                                                                                          -- INTEGRATED OILS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3rd Qtr.      3rd Qtr.      %   9 Firms                     1991          1990       Chg                                                                                                          Amoco Corp               290,000       530,000      - 45   Atlantic Richfield      -156,000       462,000       ...

Aggressive cost-cutting helped lift earnings for the railgroup above analysts' expectations. Industrywide carloadingscontinued to trail year-ago levels, but the rate of declinenarrowed considerably during the third quarter, indicatingthe industry's downturn may be ending. Some freightcategories, particularly grain and merchandise containers,showed traffic gains. Carloadings rose 3% at Union Pacific.Excluding a $575 million after-tax restructuring charge,Union Pacific's net would have risen 5%. Santa Fe benefitedfrom improved rail traffic, new labor agreements, work forcereductions and fuel expense decreases. Analysts expecttraffic and earnings to continue their improvement in thefourth quarter.   Trucking company earnings were hurt by weak trafficlevels, some rate discounting and rising costs. ConsolidatedFreightways cited operating losses at Emery Worldwide, itsair freight unit.   Big air-express companies, showing no evidence of economicrecovery, were hurt by sluggish volume growth and acontinuing shift toward slower, cheaper delivery products.Federal Express had a tough revenue comparison with lastyear, when it got extra business from a threatened strike atrival United Parcel Service. Total volume grew just 3%, andcompetition and economic weakness took their toll overseas.Airborne's overnight growth rate, which had been improving inthe second quarter, slipped back as the economic slumpcontinued. The company marketed heavily a deferred-deliveryservice, and average revenue per pound fell 6%. ConsolidatedFreightways' Emery Worldwide unit posted an operating loss of$29.6 million compared with $9.6 million the previous year,as the company's new focus on heavy freight cut the volume ofdaily shipments. For the current quarter, analyst Paul R.Schlesinger of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities seesprofit dropping about 70% at Airborne and 30% at Federal,despite somewhat improved shipment volume compared with lastyear.   American President's turnaround, among marine transportcompanies, reflected cost-reduction programs and higher cargovolumes, partly from hauling military gear back from thePersian Gulf. Without a $69.9 million after-tax restructuringcharge, net in the year-ago third quarter would have amountedto $9.3 million.   Sales of heavy and medium-duty trucks continued theirslump, as companies complained of uneven and unpredictablemarket conditions. Navistar estimated that industry unitsales declined 21% during its year ended Oct. 31. It saidthat would put industry sales at their lowest level since1983. Cummins Engine said it sees no signs of improvement inits major markets. But a cost-cutting program helped Cumminsnarrow its latest loss, and the company aims to break even inthe fourth quarter.   The heavy equipment slump spread beyond the U.S. to somekey foreign markets. Caterpillar said its constructionequipment sales outside the country fell 16% in the quarter,about the same rate of decline as its domestic sales. Deeresaw lower overseas sales of its farm equipment, particularlyin Europe. With the downturn hitting everything fromforklifts at Nacco to cranes at Manitowoc, expectations forthe fourth quarter are low. Caterpillar, which expectsanother loss in the period, said its U.S. markets are likelyto lag behind the overall economic recovery. It also sees&quot;difficult&quot; conditions abroad next year.

Sales are surging among afew big builders, especially those offering moderately pricedhomes for first-time buyers.   Low inventories have also brightened the outlook for newconstruction, and lower mortgage rates have made homes moreaffordable. Kaufman andamp; Broad, Los Angeles, said the Californiahousing market remains &quot;erratic&quot; as it emerges fromrecession; it said orders in that state more than doubled inSeptember from a year ago, after sharp year-to-year declinesin July and August. Centex of Dallas also cited improvedorders in the first several weeks of the current quarterafter declines in July and August, a pattern that could&quot;favorably affect results late in the fiscal year.&quot;   But the Commerce Department said new-home sales nationallyfell a sharp 12.9% in September, renewing concerns aboutinventories and consumer confidence.   Many retailers, hurt by continued weakness in sales andheavy markdowns, are expected to report that profits fell orwere flat with last year's weak results in the Octoberquarter. Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year,already has posted a 16% drop in third-quarter net income;profit at its giant retailing unit fell 39%. J.C. Penney,Dayton Hudson and Woolworth are also expected to reportprofit drops. Earnings are likely to be flat at MayDepartment Stores, Nordstrom, Kmart and Limited. But analystsexpect profit to jump 20% or more at Gap, Wal-Mart, DillardDepartment Stores and Home Depot. Their success shows that&quot;even in a weak econ omy, there's enough market sharetransfer that good retailers can still really grow,&quot; saysWilliam Smith of Smith Barney.   With consumer confidence sagging again, the outlook forthe crucial fourth quarter, which includes the Christmasselling season, is grim. Still, some companies, such asKmart, are forecasting higher sales than a year ago.   While most big hotel companies continue to slump throughthe recession, several casino concerns showed healthy gainsfrom the third quarter of 1990. Marriott's earnings continueto be affected by the weak travel market and the company'sunsold hotel assets. Strong operating gains at Hilton Hotels'Nevada casinos helped mitigate the effects of continuedsoftness in its hotel operations. Caesars World's sharprebound was due in part to unlucky high rollers and improvedtable game play, while Circus Circus Enterprises' earningsbenefited from its newer Las Vegas, Nev., casino andoperating gains at its other Nevada properties. Daniel Lee,an analyst with First Boston Corp., says the fourth quartershould bring improved results for most casino operators, asit will compare with a weak 1990 fourth quarter thatreflected recession-related jitters. Hotel companies willprobably take longer to rebound, Mr. Lee said, and aren'tlikely to show improvement until 1992.   The restaurant industry stuck to lower pricing strategies,but continued to suffer from the recessionary slowdown.Earnings and transactions rose at McDonald's and PepsiCo'sKentucky Fried Chicken, as the chains boosted &quot;value&quot;promotions. While PepsiCo restaurants -- KFC, Pizza Hut andTaco Bell -- saw continued double-digit profit growthoverseas, McDonald's operating profit growth abroad was flatbecause of slowed markets and weaker foreign currencies inCanada and England. TCBY profit plummeted, as store salesfell 5%, but that was an improvement on the 10% drop in thelast quarter. Michael Mueller with Montgomery Securitiesforecasts an 11% increase in fourth-quarter earnings forMcDonald's as lower prices continue to boost traffic andlower food costs help profit margins.   Recreational-products companies posted a mixed bag ofresults, with some entertainment concerns showing lowerearnings but toy companies posting strong gains.   Such entertainment companies as Paramount Communicationsand Time Warner were hurt by factors that included weak salesat the box office and softness in the U.S. televisionsyndication market.   &quot;The box office kept diminishing after the first flurry ofactivity around July 4 with `Terminator 2.' It was prettymuch downhill from there on,&quot; said Harold Vogel, anentertainment analyst at Merrill Lynch. &quot;The box office is ina slump, and there's no sign that it'll end in the fourthquarter.&quot;   Analysts said big toy companies Hasbro and Mattel aregaining share at the expense of smaller players, in partbecause of solid bottom-line management and healthy Europeansales.   Thomas Kully, an analyst at William Blair andamp; Co., said thecompanies are being helped by solid performances by theirprincipal toy lines, Milton Bradley at Hasbro and Barbie atMattel. &quot;Though they're not dominating the results, I thinkthey're leading the results,&quot; says Mr. Kully.   &quot;The large toy companies like Hasbro, Mattel and Tyco willcontinue to take the momentum that they've exhibited in thethird quarter and post good results in the fourth quarterdespite the overall softness at retail,&quot; said Gary M.Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder Peabody. Analysts said it'sdifficult to identify a trend for the whole recreationalproducts category as its components are too diverse.   Polaroid's third-quarter net included a $925 millionpretax gain from a patent infringement settlement withEastman Kodak. Time Warner's third-quarter net loss includeda $60 million charge for buy-outs and dismissals at itsmagazine group. Its results were hurt by weakness in its filmdivision, its largest source of revenue, where profit fell14% largely because of fewer television programs sold in theU.S. syndication market this fall.   In the media sector, Capital Cities/ABC continued tosuffer from weak national and local advertising markets. CBSdelayed its third-quarter earnings until after the WorldSeries, a highly unusual move that foreshadows further lossesbeyond those already taken on CBS's $1.06 billion four-yearprofessional baseball deal. Analysts don't expect earningsfor the networks in the fourth quarter to improve from lastyear's dismal results.   The results of newspaper companies were uniformly hurt bythe recession's negative effect on advertising spending.However, declines in advertising were far heavier at the NewYork Times and Dow Jones, whose largest media properties arein the depressed Northeast, while Tribune Co. and TimesMirror, with more far-flung papers, had smaller declines inresults. As with network TV, newspaper industry analystsaren't expecting the situation for major companies to improvethis quarter.   The return to profits by some air lines -- albeit small --has fueled hopes that the worst may be over for the embattledindustry. A mid-September change in pricing, makingdiscounted fares harder to obtain, boosted revenueindustrywide. That, in turn, produced a last-minute surgethat narrowed the expected loss at USAir Group and made theprofit at AMR and Delta Air Lines larger than most WallStreet analysts had forecast. It's unclear how much thatuptick will help financially struggling carriers operating inChapter 11, such as America West Air lines and ContinentalAirlines Holdings. So far, analysts say that the improvedpricing is holding steady in the fourth quarter, which couldhelp the tradition ally weak period. Most airlines, however,don't see a full recovery until the national economyimproves.   Apparel makers reported mixed results as disappointingretail sales continue to depress business at many concerns.   Earnings fell at Brown Group, which blamedslower-than-normal traffic at shopping malls. With men'sclothing sales still sluggish, Hartmarx's loss widened from ayear earlier and reflected lower revenue from its retaildivision, where it has closed stores.   L.A. Gear posted a net loss compared with a profit a yearearlier, as profit margins eroded from heavier markdowns.Springs Industries recorded a profit compared with a loss ayear earlier when it had a $70 million one-time restructuringcharge.   Despite the general retail downturn, some appparel makersposted gains. Im proved sales in its jeanswear divisionhelped VF record a rise in profit from a year earlier.Reebok's earnings were buoyed by a surge in internationalsales.   As many retailers are expecting a lackluster fourthquarter, analysts believe that most apparel concerns arelikely to post modest fourth-quarter increases.

Heinz and Kellogg boosted marketing expenses significantlyin the period as did ConAgra, which said they shrank earningsat its consumer frozen foods unit. Commodity prices weresignificant profit factors for some. Quaker Oats cited lowercosts as part of its earnings gain, but higher peanut costshurt Lance. Increased banana-processing expenses trimmedDole's results. A favorable oil seed sector boostedArcher-Daniels-Midland's earnings. Campbell had an easycomparison against year-ago restructuring charges but CPCInternational's profit dropped because of a $31.5 millioncharge for a discontinued unit. Heinz's net includes a gainfrom the sale of a corn-milling operation. Hershey attributedsales growth primarily to an acquisition.   Prudential Securities analyst John M. McMillin seescontinuation of &quot;a real deceleration&quot; in earnings growth tothe 5%-6% range in the current quarter for companieshistorically posting low double-digit gains.   Food retailers' earnings were affected by cautiousconsumer spending and a slowdown in the inflation rate offood costs, leaving few price increases to pass on tocustomers. These problems are expected to continue thisquarter. As a group, however, earnings rose, boosted byKroger, which saw earnings leap because of lower interestexpenses and better-than-expected cash flow. The company wentthrough a major restructuring in 1988 to fend off a hostiletakeover, and took on more than $4 billion in new debt;earnings have shown huge increases as the company has paiddown debt. American Stores' earnings rise was helped by aone-time gain on the sale of its Alpha Beta stores. Citingrecession in its major markets, tougher competition and a&quot;trade down&quot; mentality in consumer food-buying habits, GreatAtlantic andamp; Pacific Tea saw earnings fall.   The major beverage companies reported mostly higherearnings, despite closing a difficult summer selling seasonwith volume growth restrained by the weak economy. Strongersales overseas drove Coca-Cola's earnings gain, partlyoffsetting a sluggish domestic market. Coke and Pepsi saidtheir U.S. soft-drink volume, as measured by case sales,inched up only 1% or so, off from the 3% to 4% growth ofprevious years. Pepsi's earnings fell, after a charge mostlyre lated to job cuts at its Frito-Lay unit. Un able to raiseprices or volume much, Coca-Cola Enterprises, a Coke bottler,posted a loss. Whitman returned to profitability following abig loss in the year-ago quarter, which contained a $170.8million pretax restructuring charge.   Beer volume was hampered by the excise tax increasecoupled with brewers' price boosts. Based on barrels of beersold, Anheuser-Busch's volume rose 0.87% -- under someanalysts' forecasts. The beverage business is expected tostrengthen as the economy bounces back, with analystsforecasting fourth-quarter per-share earnings gains of about24% for Pepsi, and 20% for both Coke and Anheuser.   Health-care companies turned in a mixed performance ashospital companies reported slower quarters while operatorsof health maintenance organizations thrived.   U.S. Healthcare attributed its strong performance to thelargest membership increase in its HMOs in five years. Thecompany, which earlier in the year split its stock 3-for-2,also recently boosted its regular dividend 32%.   Community Psychiatric Centers, in contrast, ended 22 yearsof quarterly profit increases, reporting a precipitous dropin net after $23 million of charges for uncollected bills.Some analysts faulted management's focus on acquisitions at atime when the mental health care industry has been squeezedby down ward pressures on prices, patient admis sions andlength of hospital stays.

Theweak economy and price wars in some big parts of the marketbattered earnings almost across the board.   International Business Machines' earnings also sufferedbecause customers have almost stopped buying the currentgeneration of mainframes and disk drives, but thenew-generation machines were available only in tinyquantities in the third quarter. Cost-cutting helped DigitalEquipment, but earnings were up mainly because theyear-earlier results were so dismal. Even Hewlett-Packard,which did much better than its competitors, said price warskept its results below its expectations.   Some of the high flyers ran into trouble, too. Compaqreported its first loss, as it took a $135 million charge tocover the cost of laying off 12% of its work force. Apple'searnings fell again as its drastically lower prices continuedto increase its share of unit sales but also continued to eatinto profit. Likewise, Sun's push to gain market share keptprices low enough that its earnings rose only 3%.   The situation should improve some in the fourth quarterand early next year, at least for makers of IBM-compatiblemainframes and related equipment. As their new generation ofproducts becomes available, they should be able to live offthe pent-up demand for a while. But it's not clear yet howmany quarters that de mand will last, and it won't doanything to alleviate the pressure on makers of personalcomputers and workstations.   It was more of the same doldrums for the semiconductorindustry, which has been hurting for more than a year becauseof the economic downturn, sluggish computer markets andprofit-slashing price wars. But this time, chip makers werejoined in their misery by Intel, which postedsmaller-than-expected net income after having defied the chipslump for the first half of the year with sales of itsimmensely popular microprocessors.   Advanced Micro posted its third consecutive quarter ofearnings after a string of losses last year, mainly becauseof booming sales of its new chips that mimic Intel'smicroprocessors. But price cutting and falling demand forstandard &quot;commodity&quot; chips cut into profits at Intel andAdvanced Micro as well as at An alog Devices and NationalSemiconductor. National posted a $149.3 million charge toclose unneeded manufacturing plants. Chipmakers' flaggingfortunes also translated into poor sales for suppliers ofchip-making equipment such as Applied Materials.Chip-industry executives, who once expected a healthy reboundthis fall, now don't expect much growth until well into nextyear.   Software concerns posted strong re sults, but the industryremained divided between rapid-growth and slower-growthconcerns -- a trend that is likely to continue. Microsoft andNovell continued to star, posting profit increases of morethan 60% over robust performances a year ago. LotusDevelopment reported a strong gain against a disappointingyear-ago period, but its profit rate still lags well behindthe industry's leaders. Oracle rebounded with a small profitagainst a year-ago loss, while two other former high-fliers,Autodesk and Adobe Systems, turned in solid, butunspectacular quarters.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph had strong operatingresults, but was set back by $4 billion in restructuringcharges related to the merger with NCR and a reorganizing ofits phone-equipment business. It also reported the combinedresults of the companies for the first time; without thenonrecurring charges, it would have reported net income of$848 million, or 66 cents a share.   Analysts now expect a resumption of healthy earnings, andATandamp;T said it still expects to show a profit for the fullyear.   Communications Satellite, or Comsat, cited higher tariffrevenue from transmission customers, but said expectedcharges of about $45 million for employee-benefit costs couldpractically wipe out fourth-quarter earnings. Motorola saidthe continuing world-wide effect of the recession has causedslower sales growth and pressure on operating profit,particularly in its cellular equipment business.   United Technologies and Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturingboth cited continued economic sluggishness, more so forMinnesota Mining, which sells a broader array of manufacturedproducts. Minnesota Mining, or 3M, said it expects a similarfourth-quarter decline.   United Tech said weak automotive and building systemsmarkets were mostly responsible for its decline, but thethird quarter was better than the first or second, andanalysts speculated there might be no further deteriorationin its businesses -- including aircraft engines andindustrial products such as cooling and heating equipment.United recently announced a major restructuring of itsoperations in an effort to reduce annual costs by $1 billionby 1993.   Texas Instruments' loss widened sharply and followed arecord $157 million second-quarter loss. It cited continuingweak demand for semiconductors, its biggest business, andfurther charges for cost-cutting efforts. Analystsconsequently have become more pessimistic about the fourthquarter.   Raytheon said improved earnings were attributable tostrong defense electronics, particularly for its Patriot airdefense missile systems, strong energy-segment growth andgood appliance sales, led by its Amana line.   Once again, biomed companies almost all marched to adifferent drummer.   Acuson, a maker of ultrasound instruments, says stronginternational sales sparked the rise reported in the Sept. 28quarter, and continuation of that trend fuels analysts' hopesfor another 20% profit growth in the current quarter to anexpected $15.5 million.   Amgen's biotech profit explosion was fired by sales of itstwo big products, Epogen and Neupogen -- illustrating thebiotech industry's single guiding principle: Companies withFDA-approved products make money and immature companies stillin the research mode continue to burn cash. For the Dec. 31quarter, analysts expect profit of $57.5 million, comparedwith a year-ago loss of $28 million, which resulted from a$50 million pretax charge for the repurchase of technologyrights.   Heart-valve companies are increasing profits in the 20%range because of an aging population requiring more cardiacdevices. St. Jude Medical also credits price increases andreduced costs; analysts look for December-quarter profit of$20 million to $22 million, up about 25% to 39%.   Stryker's plunging profit is more apparent than real.Year-ago earnings were inflated by a $10 million litigationsettlement. Analysts expect the company to return to itsnormal 30% profit growth in the fourth quarter to better than$8 mil lion, due to sales growth of its advanced surgicalequipment.

One exception was Aetna Lifeandamp; Casualty, which posted total catastrophe losses of $19million, lowering earnings by roughly 20 cents a share. Forthe fourth quarter, profits are expected to be depressed at ahandful of companies, including Safeco and Ohio Casualty, asa result of the recent Oakland, Calif., fire.   Among life insurers, Provident Life andamp; Accident took alarge addition to reserves for individual disabilityinsurance, a business where claims traditionally increaseduring an economic downturn. American General's net incomesuffered in comparison with last year's results, whichincluded a $42 million capital gain.   Except for Calfed, the major thrifts produced no freshdisasters. Calfed took big provisions for loan and realestate losses, reflecting greater capital pressures and amore pessimistic view on real estate values, particularly inCalifornia, than that of other thrifts such as H.F. Ahmansonand Great Western Financial. Poor profit comparisons loom incoming quarters. Peter Treadway, a Smith Barney analyst,cites three negative trends. Net interest margins willdecline from record highs (unless interest rates are cut muchfurther from already-low levels). Nonperforming assets willkeep climbing as the real estate recession in California andelsewhere persists. And third, originations ofadjustable-rate mortgages, which are the industry's bread andbutter, will continue to falter in the face of competitionfrom commercial banks making lots of fixed-rate loans. Evenwell-run Golden West Financial will have to work hard toblunt this market-grabbing strategy.

Ameritech and Bell Atlantic were helped by gains onthe sale of respective stakes in New Zealand's telephonecompany. Southwestern Bell was carried by strong results inits cellular and Yellow Pages directory businesses.   GTE outperformed the Bells in phone operations as itbenefited from a general cost-cutting program; its net incomeimprovement was all in operating earnings, whereas the Bellsshowed little or no operating growth. But MCI's operatingresults were actually down, before a year-earlier charge of$550 million for network modernization costs.   Analysts generally see no improvement in the fourthquarter for local phone companies, with continuing pressureto reduce costs and increase customer phone lines.   The Edison Electric Institute, an electric utilityassociation, said approved electric-utility rate increasestotaled $2.9 billion, more than double the year-earlieramount. It noted Commonwealth Edison's single $750 millionrate increase for nu clear power construction recovery costs.   Nevertheless, many utilities' results were up or down onlymarginally. Among the largest, Pacific Gas andamp; Electric saidresults were lower because of a nuclear-unit shutdown forrefueling.                                                                                                          -- TELEPHONE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3rd Qtr.      3rd Qtr.      %   15 Firms                    1991          1990       Chg                                                                                                          Alltel Corp               46,735        46,796         0   Ameritech Corp           379,400       311,200      + 22   Bell Atlantic Corp       382,700       358,400      +  7   Centel Corp               70,781        20,937      +238   Cincinnati Bell           18,755        23,495      - 20   GTE Corp                 462,000       437,000      +  6   MCI Communicat           140,000      -168,000       ...

But power systems, medical systems and GEFinancial Services businesses, including the Kidder Peabodybrokerage unit, showed significantly higher results. TheNational Broadcasting Co. unit also had higher operatingprofit on a $110 million gain from the sale of its interestin the RCA Columbia Home Video venture.   ITT also cited the recession for substantial declines inits industrial businesses -- automotive and avionicsequipment, switches, pumps and other process controls, andwood products, among others. Results at ITT Financial weredown sharply on higher losses in consumer lending and reducedcommercial finance business.   And Teledyne, which one analyst recently called a mishmashof underperforming businesses, suffered from both lower salesand a $65.8 million charge for restructuring, in which itexpects to sell or close some operations. Its four mainbusinesses are aviation and electronics, industrial products,specialty metals and consumer products.   Textron, on the other hand, said its aerospace businessimproved, with higher operating earnings from helicopters andpropulsion systems. Its financial services businessesbenefited from better interest rate margins and lowerexpenses.   Howard Rubel, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence who followsdiversified companies, said that for manufacturers, &quot;aboutthe most we can say perhaps is that more of the recession isbehind us than is ahead of us.&quot; So the focus in the fourthquarter will remain on cost-cutting and improvement inoperating efficiencies.
