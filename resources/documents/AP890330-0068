Israeli troops shot and killed one Palestinian. Arab reportslisted 19 wounded in the West Bank, while the army listed four.   Rallies in support of the Palestinian uprising went offpeacefully for the most part in northern Israel. But policearrested 20 Arabs for possessing leaflets officials said couldincite violence.   The strike by Arabs in Israel and the occupied landscommemorates the March 30, 1976 deaths of six Israeli Arabs whowere shot by Israeli troops while protesting the government'sseizure of Arab land for an army firing range.   Army reinforcements were called up in both the West Bank andGaza to prevent unrest on this anniversary known as Land Day.Starting at midnight, the army banned Palestinians from enteringIsrael for 24 hours.   In the most extensive closure since November, the army imposed acurfew in the Gaza Strip, confining all 650,000 residents to theirhomes. Large areas of the West Bank were either under curfew orclosed to journalists who did not have an army escort.   Outlawed black, red, white and green Palestinian flags flutteredfrom electricity poles and rooftops throughout the West Bank.   An army spokesman said a 20-year-old Palestinian carrying alarge stone was shot and killed in the village of Shweike nearTulkarem as he was about to ambush an army officer in a narrowalleyway.   The army said another Palestinian died overnight after a clashin the West Bank village of Salfit between soldiers and protesters.Israel radio said his body was found in a car with four wantedactivists.   The deaths brought to 414 the number of Palestinians killedsince the uprising against Israeli occupation began in December1987. Eighteen Israelis have also died.   In the northern Israeli village of Kfar Kanna, about 400 Moslemfundamentalists marched carrying green Islamic banners and chantedKoranic verses.   Anti-Israeli protests and marches were also planned in threeother villages inside Israel, including Nazareth, where Jesus spenthis youth.   Police said strike-enforcers hurled stones at taxi cabs breakingthe strike in Nazareth, where shops were closed and police guardedthe entrance to the predominantly Arab town of 40,000.   On the Golan Heights, which Israel annexed after capturing itfrom Syria, underground leaflets were distributed to Druse Arabscalling on them to join the Land Day strike.   Ehud Olmert, Israel's Arab affairs minister, said on Israeltelevision Wednesday night that the protests were not justified andwarned: ``Arab leaders face a special responsibility test, and Ihope they pass it for the benefit of good relations.''   The involvement of Israeli Arabs, who account for 740,000 ofIsrael's 4.2 million people, raised particular concern in Israel.The nearly 16-month Palestinian uprising has led Arabs with Israelicitizenship to increasingly identify with the 1.7 millionPalestinians in the occupied lands.   In a recent editorial, the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said therewas ``an effort by the underground leadership of the uprising tosweep Israel's Arabs into extremism and bloodshed.''   The last sympathy strike by Israeli Arabs commemorated theproclamation of a Palestinian state by the PLO's parliament, whichmet in Algiers Nov. 15.   Police said the number of attacks carried out by Palestiniannationalists in Israel _ 69 before in 1987 _ jumped to 208 lastyear.   In the most serious incident, 25 Israelis were wounded bygrenades in a Haifa shopping district last August.   Last year, 30,000 Israeli Arabs marched on Land Day in supportof the Palestinian revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation.There were no major incidents of violence inside Israel, but fourPalestinians died in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza.</TEXT></DOC>
