Recent disclosures about safety and environmental problems atmany nuclear weapons facilities charged the atmosphere at many ofSunday's protests.   ``I think it's great that people had the courage and convictionto come out to this contaminated site and say, `No more,''' saidCarter Ellison, a spokeswoman for Colorado Freeze Voters.   She was among about 4,500 people who gathered peacefully atRocky Flats, the site 16 miles northwest of Denver where plutoniumtriggers for nuclear weapons are made. FBI and EnvironmentalProtection Agency officials raided Rocky Flats on June 6 toinvestigate allegations of illegal dumping of hazardous materials,and a federal grand jury began probing the plant on Tuesday.   Organizers had hoped to circle the plant but they fell about13,000 people short of the number needed to cover the 17-mileperimeter. John Hay, a teen-ager from Denver, released a largewhite balloon with a message warning that it may carry toxicplutonium particles from the plant as his older brother, Steve,played ``Taps.''   At the Nevada Test Site near Mercury, authorities arrested 52demonstrators on trespass charges, said Department of Energyspokesman Darwin Morgan. Another 28 protesters were arrested fortrespassing at the government's nuclear facility at Oak Ridge, Tenn.   Demonstrations also were held at the Colorado Capitol in Denverand at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, S.C.   In Livermore, Calif., home of a nuclear weapons research center,a petition drive to make surrounding Alameda County nuclear freewas launched.   At the Ohio State Fair in Columbus, more than 150 arms controladvocates demonstrated at the Peace Pavillion. Earlier, Gov.Richard Celeste and his wife, Dagmar, attended a Japanese teaceremony there.   Meanwhile, Paul Tibbetts Jr., the man who flew that plane thatdropped the bomb on Hiroshima, said he had no qualms about themission that killed about 140,000 people.   ``I thought then that if I am successful, I can bring this warto a quick end,'' said Tibbetts Jr., now 74, and living in Columbus.   And in Andersonville, Ga., nine American prisoners of war whodied in the Aug. 6, 1945, attack were honored Saturday with a21-gun salute, the playing of ``Taps'' and the unveiling of abronze plaque.   Police estimated at least 300 protesters marched one mile to theY-12 Nuclear Plant in Oak Ridge, where atom bomb technology wasdeveloped as part of the Manhattan Project.   ``There was a good spirit,'' said Judith Hallock, one of thefounders of the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance. ``The crowdwas celebrating life.''   About 300 people demonstrated outside the Savannah River Site,the nation's sole source of tritium for nuclear weapons which hasbeen shut for a year because of safety and environmental concerns.   Ed Arnold and 15 members from Physicians for SocialResponsibility in Atlanta said they were most concerned about thelack of health information concerning the 600,000 people who workin the nation's nuclear plants.   Rita Fellers, with a group called the Savannah River Project,attacked the weapons themselves as ``more dangerous than they aresupportive to national security.''   Elsewhere, about 50 people set off on a 60-mile march fromKansas City, Mo., to Whiteman Air Force Base to show theircommitment to world peace. They plan to take four days to completethe walk, which symbolize the distance that would be needed toplace side by side the bodies of those killed at Hiroshima and atNagasaki, said Maril Crabtree, president of the Interfaith PeaceAlliance.   ``I just came out here to be here and to think peaceful thingsand look for a little serenity,'' said Bob Ellis, 48.   Sunday also saw about 20 conservatives rally in Greenville,S.C., to urge early deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative,the envisioned Star Wars defensive shield. ``Deploy SDI by '95; NoAmerican Hiroshimas,'' read some posters at the rally.   ``We believe that development of the SDI research programs willhelp ensure peace and security for future generations,'' said LillyLenderman, state chairwoman for Concerned Women for America, aconservative activist group.</TEXT></DOC>
