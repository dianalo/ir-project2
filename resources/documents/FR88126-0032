The notice was based upon the recommendations of the AdvisoryReview Panel on OTC Miscellaneous External Drug Products (the Panel), whichwas the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the activeingredients in this drug class. Interested persons were invited to submitcomments by September 27, 1982. Reply comments in response to commentsfiled in the initial comment period could be submitted by October 27, 1982.In accordance with andSection; 330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration (address above), after deletionof a small amount of trade secret information.In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, one manufacturerand one consumer submitted comments. Copies of the comments received areon public display in the Dockets Management Branch.In order to conform to terminology used in the OTC drug review regualtions(21 CFR 330.10), the present document is designated as a ``tentative finalmonograph.'' Its legal status, however, is that of a proposed rule. Inthis tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish Subpart E ofPart 358 (21 CFR Part 358, Subpart E), FDA states for the first time itsposition on the establishment of a monograph for OTC boil treatment drugproducts. Final agency action on this matter will occur with the publicationat a future date of a final rule for OTC boil treatment drug products.This proposal constitutes FDA's tentative conclusions on OTC boil treatmentdrug products based on the comments received and the agency's independentevaluation of the Panel's report. Although the Panel limited its deliberationsto boil ointments, the agency believes that this rulemaking appropriatelyshould apply to any OTC drug product labeled for the treatment of boils.Accordingly, the agency is now using the term ``boil treatment'' throughoutthis rulemaking rather than ``boil ointment.''The OTC procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) now provide that any testingnecessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerly resultedin a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the resultsof that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemakingprocess before the establishment of a final monograph. Accordingly, FDAwill no longer use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safeand effective and not misbranded), ``Category II'' (not generally recognizedas safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available dataare insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testingis required) at the final monograph stage, but will use instead the terms``monograph conditions'' (old Category I) and ``nonmonograph conditions''(old Categories II and III). This document retains the concepts of CategoriesI, II, and III at the tentative final monograph stage. The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products thatare subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe andeffective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> On or after that date, no OTC drug product thatis subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognizedas safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unlessit is the subject of an approved application. Further, any OTC drug productsubject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effectivedate of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardlessof the date the product was initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouragedto comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date.In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the agency stated that ifit proposed to adopt the Panel's recommendations it would propose thatOTC boil ointment drug products be eliminated from the OTC market effective6 months after the date of publication of a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> However, in this document the agency is proposinga monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC boil treatmentdrug products would be generally recognized as safe and effective and notmisbranded. Experience has shown that relabeling of products covered bythe monograph is necessary in order for manufacturers to comply with themonograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have to be written,ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturing process. Theagency has determined that it is impractical to expect new labeling tobe in effect before 12 months after the date of publication of the finalmonograph. Experience has shown also that if the deadline for relabelingis too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and relatedpaperwork. In addition, some products will have to be reformulated to comply withthe monograph. Reformulation often involves the need to do stability testingon the new product. An accelerated aging process may be used to test anew formulation; however, if the stability testing is not successful, andif further reformulation is required, there could be a further delay inhaving a new product available for manufacture. The agency wishes to establish a reasonable period of time for relabelingand reformulation in order to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the marketplacethat could not only result in economic loss, but also interfere with consumers'access to safe and effective drug products. Therefore, the agency is proposingthat the final monograph be effective 12 months after the date of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The agency believes that within 12 months afterthe date of publication most manufacturers can order new labeling and reformulatetheir products and have them in compliance in the marketplace. If the agency determines that any labeling for a condition included inthe final monograph should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effectivedate, a shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety problemis identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a shorter deadlinemay be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products. In the event that no new data are submitted to the agency during the allotted12-month new data period or if submitted data are not sufficient to establish``monograph conditions'' for OTC boil treatment drug products, the finalrule will declare these products to be new drugs under section 201(p) ofthe act for which applications approved under section 505 of the act (21U.S.C. 355) and 21 CFR Part 314 are required for marketing. Such rule willalso declare that in the absence of an approved application, these productswould be misbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). The rulewill then be incorporated into 21 CFR Part 310, Subpart E_Requirementsfor Specific New Drugs or Devices, instead of into an OTC drug monographin Part 358. All ``OTC Volumes'' cited throughout this document refer to the submissionsmade by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notice publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 16, 1973 (38 FR 31697) and August27, 1975 (40 FR 38179) or to additional information that has come to theagency's attention since publication of the advance notice of proposedrulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets ManagementBranch. <ITAG tagnum="85">I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>1. One comment questioned the rationale for the agency's denial of itspetition dated July 21, 1982 (Ref. 1) for an extension of time for submittingcomments on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The petition wasfiled so that the results of testing and supporting information could besubmitted together with its comments. The comment stated that other petitionsfor extension of time to comment on other advance notices of proposed rulemakingshave been granted and cited the rulemaking for OTC weight control drugproducts in which an extension of 60 days was granted (47 FR 17576; April23, 1982). The comment also cited the granting of extensions of the commentperiods in the rulemaking for OTC relief of oral discomfort drug products(60 days) and for OTC oral health care drug products (90 days). The commentcontended that the Agency provided no reason for granting those petitionswhile denying its request. The comment regarded this as arbitrary treatmentand objected to the unexplained denial which came almost 2 months afterthe petition was filed and less than 2 weeks before the comment periodended.The agency acknowledges that extensions of the comment period have beengranted in other OTC drug rulemakings. In the three instances cited bythe comment, the request for extension of the comment period was for thepurpose of providing additional time to evaluate existing data and notto await test results as the comment indicated was its reason for needingmore time. In each instance, the agency provided reasons for granting theextension. (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 23, 1982 (47 FR 17576) and July 30,1982 (47 FR 32952 and 32953).) Likewise, the agency provided the commentreasons why its petition was denied. The agency stated that it is moreappropriate to consider reopening the administrative record for the inclusionof test data when the data are actually available for submission to theagency (Ref. 2). The agency also suggested that when the company is preparedto submit the new data and information, it could then petition the agencyto reopen the administrative record.Neither the comment nor the company has petitioned the agency to reopenthe administrative record since it closed on September 27, 1982. The agencypoints out that under 21 CFR 330.10(a)(7), any comments on this tentativefinal monograph may be submitted within 60 days of the publication datein the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and new data may be submitted within 12 months.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment coded EXT, Docket No. 82N-0054, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Letter to P.S.

One comment contended that the proposed regulation in the advance noticeof proposed rulemaking is not based on any fact in the administrative recordand is therefore arbitrary and capricious. The comment stated that thePanel's evaluation, which is the basis of the proposed rule, was limitedto three short paragraphs at 47 FR 28308 and that there is nothing in theadministrative record that supports the Panel's conclusion that OTC boilointment drug products are not safe and effective. The comment stated thatthe Panel did not at any point in its evaluation cite or refer to an instance_astudy, report, consumer complaint, or any other item of evidence_whichwould support its position. The comment concluded that the Panel's findingis conclusory and without any support whatsoever in the administrativerecord. The comment stated its belief that a rule based upon such an evaluationis arbitrary and capricious and would not withstand judicial scrutiny.The comment cited a number of court cases to support its position thata rule will not be sustained where there are inadequate facts in the recordto support it, and thus the matter should be remanded to the agency forfurther consideration (Ref. 1).The Panel evaluated boil ointment drug products over the course of sevenmeetings (47 FR 28307). In its evaluation, the Panel mentioned that itreceived three submissions for this type of product (47 FR 28308) and thatthere were eight labeled ingredients contained in the marketed productssubmitted (47 FR 28307). The Panel classified these 8 ingredients, plus16 other active ingredients in boil treatment drug products, in CategoryII, not because of a disregard of the evidence in the administrative record,but because of its belief that the self-treatment of boils is not desirablebecause improper treatment or a delay in receiving proper professionaltreatment may cause the infection to spread. The agency has consideredthe Panel's recommendations and has thoroughly evaluated all three submissionsthat were made to the Panel (Refs. 2, 3, and 4), as well as the commentsreceived in response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and istentatively concluding that there may be a need for such products. (Seecomment 5 and Part II below.) Based on that evaluation, the agency is proposingin this tentative final monograph to reclassify certain ingredients fromCategory II to Category III and is encouraging the submission of additionaldata and information to support the claims of safety and efficacy for currentlymarketed OTC boil treatment drug products. (See comment 5 and Part II below.)The comment's concerns that the final rule be supported by the facts inthe administrative record will be addressed as the rulemaking proceedsthrough its subsequent steps.<ITAG tagnum="74">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment No. C00001, Docket No. 82N-0054, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) OTC Volume 160005. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) OTC Volume160182. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) OTC Volume 160214.</ITAG>3. One comment was against ``putting more control of pharmaceutical disbursementsin the hands of physicians than is necessary.'' The comment argued thatphysicians are ``hard to get into see,'' are costly, and ``do not wantto be bothered until something is major.'' The comment contended that removalof boil ointment drug products from the OTC market would require that individualssee a doctor for relief. The comment recommended that the physician betaken out of prescribing ``simple medication care'' because it is timeconsuming, expensive, a misuse of physician resources, and a cause of unnecessaryhealth care expense. The purpose of the OTC drug review is to ensure that OTC drug productsare safe and effective. Accordingly, the review will result in the removalof unsafe or ineffective drug products from the OTC market. Also, someproducts may be reformulated to contain ingredients that are found to begenerally recognized as safe and effective. Products already on the marketwhich contain ingredients that are generally recognized as safe and effectivewill remain available to consumers. In some cases, entire classes of OTC products such as daytime sedativesand anticholinergics used in cough-cold drug products have been removedfrom the OTC market because the agency concluded that these products werenot appropriate for OTC use. (See the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 22, 1979 (44 FR 36378) and November 8,1985 (50 FR 46582).) However, in the case of boil treatment drug products,after reviewing the Panel's recommendations and the comments received,the agency questions the Panel's recommendations and believes that theremay be a need for OTC boil treatment drug products. However, because noingredients are in Category I at this time and because more data are needed,the agency is unable to determine until this rulemaking is completed whetherboil treatment drug products will remain available OTC. 4. One comment, from the manufacturer of an OTC anesthetic and antisepticointment drug product marketed for the temporary relief of discomfort ofboils, noted that if the agency accepts the Panel's Category II recommendationfor all OTC boil treatment drug products, then its product would be eliminatedfrom the OTC market (Ref. 1). The comment stated that marketing experienceof its product has not indicated any safety problem associated with theOTC treatment of boils and this marketing experience shows that the productis safe for OTC use within the meaning of 21 CFR 330.10(a) (4) (i), whichpermits the use of marketing experience in the evaluation of the safetyof an OTC drug product. The comment stated that its product has been marketedfor over 27 years with over 1\1/2\ million units sold in the last 6 yearsand demand is increasing for the product. The comment also stated thatonly 18 complaints were received during the last 6 years_10 concerningmild irritation caused by the product and 8 claiming lack of effectiveness.As discussed in comment 5 below, the agency believes that there may bea need for OTC boil treatment drug products. Even though the agency isupgrading several ingredients to Category III, there are no Category Iingredients at this time. (See Part II below.) Unless one or more of theCategory III ingredients are upgraded to Category I in the final rule,the comment is correct in stating that OTC boil treatment drug productswill be eliminated from the market. The agency has considered the marketing experience of the product, whichcontains ichthammol, camphor, benzocaine, sulfur, phenol, and juniper tar,and evaluated the manufacturer's previous submission to the Panel (Ref.2). (See Part II below.) The agency agrees with the comment that marketingexperience can be used to support the safety of a product; nevertheless,the manufacturer did not provide sufficient information to support thesafety and effectiveness of its product in the treatment of boils. As discussedin Part II below, the agency is classifying the ingredients listed abovein Category III at this time and is inviting the submission of additionaldata and information to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of theseingredients for the treatment of boils. <ITAG tagnum="74">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment Nos. C00001 and CR, Dockets Management Branch, DocketNo. 82N-0054. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) OTC Volume 160005.</ITAG>5. One comment (Ref. 1) disagreed with the Panel's conclusion that self-treatmentof boils is not in the best interest of the consumer because improper treatmentor a delay in receiving proper professional treatment for boils may causethe infection to spread. The comment stated that there is no safety problemassociated with the treatment of boils with OTC drugs based upon marketingexperience, scientific evidence, and the conclusions of leading expertsin the field of dermatology and infectious diseases. The comment contendedthat the Panel had not cited any incidence of systemic infection whichresulted from the temporary use of OTC boil ointment products. The commentadded that it has received no complaints that use of its product, whichhas been marketed for over 27 years, has resulted in a delay in treatmentthat caused an infection to spread. The comment claimed that the Panel'sconclusion was based on a hypothetical safety concern for which it couldprovide no reference and that the scientific evidence shows that humanskin is difficult to infect experimentally with virulent staphylococciand/or streptococci and that, once infected, it is equally difficult tomaintain the infection without seriously altering or compromising the skinof the host (Refs. 2 through 6).The comment contended that the Panel ignored evidence (Ref. 7) that showedthere is a need for a product directly available to consumers which isproperly formulated to provide temporary relief from pain of boils whichat the same time prevents further infection. The comment submitted a survey(Ref. 8) and contended that more than 83 percent of patients with boilssuffer pain along with a boil. The comment added that relief of pain willprevent a consumer from attempting to manipulate or needle a boil and thusprevents further topical spread of infection.   The comment provided affidavits containing the views of experts in thefield of dermatology and infectious diseases regarding the safe and effectiveuse of OTC boil ointments (Refs. 9, 10, and 11). The comment stated thatthe experts believe that most persons with boils never seek medical attentionand that they do not require the sophisticated and expensive services ofa physician because the vast majority of boils are well managed by normalhost defenses and are thus self-limited. The experts referred to and agreedwith the Panel's statement on boils at 47 FR 28308 that ``these infectionsare usually minor.'' The comment added that the experts recognize thatit can be argued that neglect of boils may lead to a need for surgery orsystemic antibiotics that might not otherwise have been required; however,it cannot be argued convincingly that topical boil preparations are morelikely to lead to this eventuality than hot compresses or other home remedies.  The agency agrees that the marketing experience described by the commentis supportive of the safety and effectiveness of OTC boil treatment drugproducts, but this experience cannot be used as the sole criterion fordetermining that these products are safe and effective for OTC use. Afterreviewing the Panel's recommendations, the data and information submittedby the comment, and the affidavits of experts in the field of dermatologyand infectious diseases, the agency is tentatively concluding that theremay be a need for OTC boil treatment drug products.   The agency finds that the references cited by the comment (Refs. 2 through6) show that human skin is remarkably resistant to staphylococcal and streptococcalinfection.   Duncan, McBride, and Knox (Ref. 2) state that streptococci could rarelybe recovered from the skin 24 hours after removing an occlusion of theskin of children with clinical impetigo. In another experiment, <T3>Staphylococcus pyogenes </T3>(<T3>S. pyogenes</T3>) disappeared completely from the skin within 5 hoursin 50 percent of their adult subjects. The authors pointed out that occlusionhas been requisite in all methods of inducing infection whether the organismis yeast, dermatophyte, or bacteria, and that occlusion to the degree requiredfor successful experimental infection rarely, if ever, occurs naturallyso that the conditions of natural infection have yet to be defined.   In another study, Duncan, McBride, and Knox (Ref. 3) describe a techniqueof applying staphylococcus and streptococcus in the form of an overnightbroth culture, stabbing through the drop of inoculum with a blood lancet,and covering the site with nonporous plastic tape. Four areas on each subjectwere inoculated in an identical manner. This experiment was conducted tofind a reproducible experimental skin infection so that further studiescould be undertaken on the pathogenesis of cutaneous infections. Successfulinfection of the back in 15 percent, the arm in 13 percent, the thigh in21 percent, and the leg in 38 percent of the attempts provided furtherevidence that skin is difficult to infect.   Foster and Hutt (Ref. 4) introduced staphylococci into artificial skinlesions to try to determine whether local conditions influenced multiplicationof organisms or the course of the subsequent lesion, whether differenttypes of staphylococci varied in pathogenicity, and what was the smallestinfecting dose. Covered lesions showed a considerable increase in the numbersof organisms between 2 and 8 hours, followed by a slower increase overthe next 14 hours; whereas, there was virtually no increase in numbersin the uncovered lesions even after 24 hours.   Singh, Marples, and Kligman (Ref. 5) reported that <T3>Staphylococcus aureus </T3>(<T3>S. aureus</T3>) infections have been consistently induced in normalhuman skin by applying large inocula to areas degermed with ethanol andkept moist under occlusive dressing. The organisms were confined to thesurface and did not proliferate within the living portion of the skin.Removal of the dressing was followed by swift death of almost all organisms,followed by immediate resolution of the lesion within a few days.   Elek (Ref. 6) discusses a number of experiments on man that were conductedto establish whether or not differences in the resulting lesions couldbe demonstrated (by pus formation) between randomly selected nasal strainsof <T3>S. pyogenes </T3>and other strains obtained from human lesions, whichwere therefore presumed to be virulent. Elek concluded that man appearsto possess a high degree of natural resistance to <T3>S. pyogenes. </T3>No differences in the virulence of known pyogenicstrains and nasal strains from unselected carriers could be demonstratedby accepting pus formation in man as the criterion of virulence.Although the studies above show the difficulty in producing skin infection,none of the references specifically discusses the relationship of staphylococcaland streptococcal infection to the occurrence of boils. However, Bynoe(Ref. 12) comments on Elek's suggestion (Ref. 6) that there is no differencein the virulence of different strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci,whether from pyogenic lesions or from nasal carriers. Bynoe referred toa specific case in which a nurse came on duty with a boil on her face,and, within a few days, there were two severe infections in the nursery.Cultures from the nurse with the boil and from the two infected babieswere all the same type.  The specific case cited by Bynoe (Ref. 12) would support the possibilitythat infection from boils can occur. However, in light of the other studies(Refs. 2 through 6) that support the difficulty of producing skin infection,the agency believes that a safety concern that infection may spread maynot be a major problem. However, the agency concludes that additional informationis needed before the agency can fully address the Panel's concerns thatimproper treatment or a delay in receiving professional treatment for boilsmay cause the infection to spread.  The results of the survey submitted by the comment (Ref. 8) can be summarizedas follows: The rate of furunculosis (occurrence of boils) remains lowin the United States with regional variations from 1.4 to 3.0 percent;persons plagued with boils average 2.89 attacks per year with males beingmore susceptible than females; symptoms that disturbed boil sufferers mostwere primarily pain (219 out of 257) and secondly cosmetic appearance (32out of 257); approximately 72 percent of boil sufferers did not visit aphysician; patients with boils visited a physician more frequently as thenumber of boils increased, indicating that patients know when to contacta physician; in self-medication approximately 49 percent of sufferers usedmedication, 45 percent used compresses, and 12 percent did nothing at all;and the majority of sufferers were satisfied with the treatment used whileonly 11 percent felt the treatment was not satisfactory. In addition, thesurvey indicated that 175 subjects were satisfied with their treatmentas opposed to 28 subjects who were dissatisfied. For drugs being evaluatedin the OTC drug review, the number of very satisfactory and somewhat satisfactorytreatment evaluations compared to the number of not very satisfactory andnot at all satisfactory treatment evaluations was 16 to 2 for the comment'sproduct, 6 to 0 for a product containing ichthammol, and 8 to 0 for anunspecified drawing salve. The survey also indicated that patients visiteda physician more frequently as the number of boils increased, suggestingthat patients are alerted to contact a physician if the condition is morethan something minor or if the treatment is ineffective.  In one of the affidavits submitted by the comment, Ulrich (Ref. 9) concludedthat the data above are convincing proof of the need for OTC boil ointmentdrug products. Ulrich stated that boils last from several days to severalweeks and are generally defined as an infection of the hair follicle whichproduces a painful cellulitis with <T3>S. aureus </T3>as the most common infecting organism, but other pyogeniccocci and bacilli or gram negative bacteria may also be involved.  In another affidavit, Duncan (Ref. 10) stated that over a 15-year practicemany patients ``present with their second or third inflammatory episodewith a boil_the initial episode(s) having resolved to the patients' satisfaction,with or without OTC medicament, demonstrating the basic tendency of boilsnot to spread.'' Duncan also discussed the studies (Refs. 2 through 6)described above and concluded that human skin is difficult to experimentallyinfect with virulent staphylococci and/or streptococci and that the spreadof infection from a boil is remote.  In the third affidavit, Drutz (Ref. 11) stated that most persons with boilsnever seek medical attention and that most patients do not require thesophisticated and expensive services of a physician because the vast majorityof boils are well managed by normal host defenses and are thus self-limited.Drutz also states that local spread of boils may occur from one locus toanother, or spread may be hematogenous with septicemia, metastatic abscessformation, or even endocarditis. However, Drutz contends that evidencethat topical preparations increase the risk of spread in patients withchronic recurring boils is lacking.  Based on the information provided in the affidavits, the results of thesurvey, and the references to support the suggestion that the spread ofinfection may not be a serious problem, the agency tentatively concludesthat there may be a need for OTC boil treatment drug products. Althoughthere appears to be minimal safety problems in the self-treatment of boils,the agency believes that these products should be used only for a limitedamount of time and that if the boil worsens, then the labeling of the productshould direct the consumer to see a doctor. Accordingly, the agency isproposing that these products contain warning information not to use theproduct for more than 7 days and if the condition worsens, to consult adoctor. The warning is based on the results listed in Table 6 of the survey(Ref. 8) in which the number of sufferers who had a doctor treat a boilis compared to the number of days the sufferer had the boil before seeingthe doctor. The comparison includes groups of sufferers from various geographicareas as well as groups segmented by sex and age. The average number ofdays before sufferers saw a doctor was 6.32. The agency is therefore proposing7 days to be consistent with a number of other OTC drug rulemakings whichprovide for a 7-day limitation for use. (See, for example, the tentativefinal monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products (48 FR 5852; February8, 1983) and the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drugproducts (48 FR 6820; February 15, 1983).)  Based upon the results of this survey and the additional references, theagency has upgraded some of the ingredients used in OTC boil treatmentdrug products from Category II to Category III. The agency is interestedin receiving additional public comment on the usefulness of these productsand on whether self-treatment of boils is appropriate. The agency is alsorequesting additional clinical data from studies conducted in the targetpopulation demonstrating that the ingredients used in OTC boil treatmentdrug products are safe and effective for this use.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment Nos.

The Agency's Evaluation of the Submissions</ITAG>Because the Panel did not review specific ingredients or products for usein OTC boil ointment drug products, the agency has reviewed all the submissionsto the Panel and has the following specific comments:1. One submission to the Panel contained information on a marketed productcontaining 40 to 43 percent magnesium sulfate labeled as a drawing ointmentfor external application to pimples and blemishes associated with acneand also for boils and carbuncles (Ref. 1).The submission did not contain any clinical data or information on theuse of magnesium sulfate for the relief of boils, but did contain a verybrief overview of the historical use of magnesium sulfate and a discussionregarding osmotic pressure and the resulting drawing action of magnesiumsulfate. A brief summary of the submission follows.Magnesium sulfate (epsom salts) has been used for many years to alleviatelocal inflammatory conditions by using concentrations of 20 to 50 percentin warm water to reduce common inflammation by virtue of an osmotic gradientaction. Magnesium sulfate provides a drawing action using the mechanismof osmotic pressure which brings about diffusion between solutions of differentconcentrations or between a solute and the fluid in which it is dissolved.A concentration of the magnesium ion on the skin surface causes fluid ofthe skin tissue to move the skin surface. The greatest concentrations ofmagnesium sulfate needed to bring about osmotic pressure sufficient towithdraw tissue fluids would be absorbed by the skin in only a small amount,and the body would tolerate even larger quantities without side effects.The submission pointed out that the marketed product is a saturated solutionof magnesium sulfate incorporated into a hydrophilic ointment base, andthat the effectiveness of the product as a drawing ointment for boils andcarbuncles is due to the fact that there is twice as much saturated solutionof magnesium sulfate as there is ointment base and, as a result, the productworks by the principle of osmotic pressure. The submission added that magnesiumsulfate in a wet dressing or hot pack relieves pain by its local anestheticeffect and relieves swelling by withdrawing fluid from the tissues.Regarding safety, the submission stated that magnesium sulfate can be takeninternally as a saline cathartic in doses of 15 grams (g) and is not absorbedfrom the intestinal tract. (FDA supported the safety of taking large dosesof magnesium sulfate internally when the agency issued a tentative finalmonograph for OTC laxative drug products in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2124) and proposedCategory I status for magnesium sulfate in doses of 10 to 30 g as a salinelaxative.) The submission contended that very little, if any, magnesiumsulfate is absorbed from its ointment product because, in the principleof osmotic pressure, the fluid comes toward the surface of the skin orthe area at the greatest concentration of the magnesium ion, with verylittle magnesium sulfate being absorbed.Another submission to the Panel contained a label for a product containingmagnesium sulfate 18.3 g (61 percent) and benzocaine 150 milligrams (mg)(0.5 percent) in each 30 g of propylene glycol base (Ref. 2). The labelstated that the product was a local anti-inflammatory agent to be usedas a topical dressing for minor infections such as boils and pimples. Thesubmission did not contain any additional information.These two submissions did not contain sufficient information to supportthe effectiveness of magnesium sulfate and benzocaine for the labeled claims.However, the agency concludes that 40 to 61 percent magnesium sulfate issafe when used externally. Based on the information submitted, the agencycannot determine whether magnesium sulfate is effective in treating boilsand is classifying this ingredient in Category III at this time. The useof benzocaine is discussed below. (See paragraph 2(c) below.)<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volume 160214.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) OTC Volume 160182.</ITAG>2. The third submission (Ref. 1) to the Panel contained information ona product claiming to be a pain-relieving drawing salve for boils and ananesthetic-antiseptic. Because the submission was dated January 10, 1974,the agency obtained a package of the currently marketed product; it listedthe active ingredients as ichthammol 1.86 percent, camphor 1.6 percent,benzocaine 0.5 percent, sulfur 0.44 percent, phenol 0.42 percent, and junipertar 0.11 percent and was labeled as an antiseptic drawing salve and forfast relief from painful boils. The list of ingredients in the submissionand in the currently marketed product differ (rosin and thymol have beendeleted and sulfur has been added); accordingly, the agency is discussingand classifying only the ingredients in the currently marketed product.<ITAG tagnum="21">[<T4>Note._</T4> The agency recently became aware that the product has beenreformulated again and has also been relabeled (Ref. 2). Nevertheless,none of the agency's tentative conclusions discussed in this document areaffected by these changes because the administrative record lacks sufficientinformation regarding the use of the product's ingredients for the treatmentof boils. The agency invites the submission of additional information.]</ITAG>(a) <T3>Ichthammol.</T3> This ingredient has been used for the treatment ofboils (Refs. 3 and 4) and has been used for a variety of skin disordersbecause of its anti-inflammatory, vasoconstrictive, astringent, irritant,antibacterial, emollient, demulcent, and antiseptic properties (Refs. 3through 7). It has also been reported to cause hyperepithelialization (Ref.4) and to produce a local stimulant effect which tends to improve peripheralcirculation (Ref. 7). Although historically ichthammol has been commonlyreferred to as a ``drawing'' salve for the treatment of boils, the submissiondid not include any clinical data that demonstrate such an effect. Becauseof insufficient information at this time, the agency cannot determine whetherthis ingredient is safe and effective in a concentration of 1.86 percentas an antiseptic or for its ``drawing'' action for the treatment of boils.Therefore, the agency is classifying ichthammol in Category III.(b) <T3>Camphor.</T3> Camphor has been classified as a Category I analgesic,anesthetic, and antipruritic in the tentative final monograph for OTC externalanalgesic drug products. (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983; 48 FR 5867 to 5868.) Inthat publication, the agency concurred with the Advisory Review Panel onOTC Topical Analgesic, Antirheumatic, Otic, Burn, and Sunburn Preventionand Treatment Drug Products that camphor in concentrations of 0.1 to 3percent is safe and effective for the temporary relief of pain, itching,or pain and itching associated with monor burns, sunburn, minor cuts, scrapes,insect bites, or minor skin irritations. Because the tentative final monographfor OTC external analgesic drug products does not specifically discussthe use of camphor for the treatment of boils and because the submissionto this rulemaking contained insufficient information, the agency is classifyingcamphor in a concentration of 1.6 percent in Category III.(c) <T3>Benzocaine.</T3> While the submission to this rulemaking (Ref. 1) containedpublished articles regarding the safety and effectiveness of benzocaine,none involved the use of benzocaine on boils. Benzocaine was also classifiedin Category I in the external analgesic tentative final monograph for thetemporary relief of pain, itching, or pain and itching in concentrationsof 5 to 20 percent. Because the submission contained insufficient informationthat benzocaine in a concentration of 0.5 percent is safe and effectivefor the treatment of boils, the agency is classifying this ingredient inCategory III.(d) <T3>Sulfur.</T3> The only discussion of sulfur in the submitted informationwas a brief reference to its use in the treatment of scabies in a navalhospital (Ref. 8); there is no mention of its use in the treatment of boils.The agency assumes the intended use of sulfur in the product relates tothe antiseptic claim in the products' labeling. In this light, the agencynotes that in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC antifungaldrug products that was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 23, 1982 (47 FR 12480), sulfur was describedas an antifungal agent due to its keratolytic effect and was classifiedin Category III. (See 47 FR 12549.) Similarly, in the same issue of the<T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 12430), the advance notice of proposedrulemaking for OTC acne drug products discusses the rationale for the useof sulfur in acne because of its keratolytic and antibacterial effects.(See 47 FR 12447.) Sulfur was classified in Category I in that rulemaking.However, because there is insufficient information for the use of sulfurin a concentration of 0.44 percent to treat boils, the agency is placingthis ingredient in Category III at this time.(e) <T3>Phenol.</T3> In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), the AdvisoryReview Panel for OTC Antimicrobial Drug Products classified phenol in CategoryIII for several antimicrobial uses in concentrations of 1.5 percent orless. In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5852), phenol 0.5to 1.5 percent was classified in Category I as an analgesic, anesthetic,and antipruritic. (See 48 FR 5867.) Because these rulemakings do not addressthe use of phenol in the treatment of boils and because there is insufficientinformation to make a determination at this time, the agency is classifyingphenol in Category III.(f) <T3>Juniper tar.</T3> In the tentative final monograph for OTC externalanalgesic drug products, juniper tar in concentrations of 1 to 5 percentwas classified in Category I as an analgesic, anesthetic, and antipruritic(48 FR 5867). However, because that rulemaking did not specifically addressthe use of juniper tar for the treatment of boils and because there isinsufficient information in the submission to this rulemaking, the agencycannot make a determination on the safety and effectiveness of junipertar in a concentration of 0.11 percent at this time. Therefore, the agencyis classifying juniper tar in Category III at this time.The submission did not contain any safety or effectiveness data on theuse of any of the ingredients above individually in treating boils. Clinicaldata are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of using theseingredients to provide relief from the pain and discomfort of boils. The``drawing'' action of ingredients such as magnesium sulfate or ichthammoland the antiseptic action of sulfur and phenol on a boil needs to be shownclinically. Without such information, the agency is unable to determinethat any of these ingredients are generally recognized as safe and effectivefor these uses.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volume 160005.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Letter from H.W.

Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions</ITAG>Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submissionof data and information to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of anyboil treatment ingredient or condition included in the review by followingthe procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740) and clarifiedApril 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). That policy statement includes proceduresfor the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings withindustry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submittedtest data and other information.B. Summary of the Agency's Changes in the Panel's RecommendationsFDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and concludesthat it will tentatively adopt the Panel's report with the changes describedin FDA's responses to the comments above and with other changes describedin the summary below. A summary of the changes made by the agency follows.1. Based on submitted information not available to the Panel, the agencytentatively concludes that there may be a need for OTC boil treatment drugproducts and that manufacturers should be afforded an opportunity to provideadditional data to support continued marketing of these drug products.In addition, the agency is proposing the following warning, ``Do not usethis product for more than 7 days. If condition worsens or does not improve,consult a doctor.'' (See Part I. paragraph 5. above.) The agency is alsoproposing two additional warnings, ``For external use only'' and ``Avoidcontact with the eyes.'' Use of both statements is consistent with thewarnings included in a number of other OTC drug monographs for topicaldrug products. (See, example, the tentative final monograph for OTC externalanalgesic drug products (48 FR 5852; February 8, 1983); the tentative finalmonograph for OTC skin protection drug products (48 FR 6820; February 15,1983); and the final monograph for OTC topical otic drug products (51 FR28656; August 8, 1986).)2. The agency is aware that a manufacturer of an OTC boil treatment drugproduct filed comments following the publication of the tentative finalmonograph for OTC external analgesic drug products (Ref. 1). The manufacturerraised two basic issues involving labeling of boil treatment products.One issue was a request to revise the labeling indication for local anestheticsused as external analgesics to include relief of pain and itching associatedwith boils. This request will be considered within the context of the externalanalgesic rulemaking at a later date. The other issue, which concernedan additional warning for boil treatment drug products, will be addressedin this document. The manufacturer suggested the additional warning asfollows: ``Do not use on boils on the lips, nose, cheeks, or forehead.Seek professional assistance for treatment of boils in these areas.'' Themanufacturer also stated that an additional warning statement is neededto warn consumers to consult a doctor ``if fever or redness around theboil develops.''The agency notes that the Panel stated that the use of systemic antimicrobialtherapy is indicated for boils associated with a surrounding redness orthose associated with fever, or located on the upper lip, nose, cheeks,or forehead. (See 47 FR 28308). After reviewing the Panel's comments, theagency agrees with the manufacturer that the additional warnings are needed.Accordingly, the agency is including the warning recommended by the manufacturerbut is making a minor revision to make the wording more consistent withother tentative final monographs. The agency is revising the limitationfor use warning discussed in paragraph 1 above to include the manufacturer'ssuggested warning statement regarding the development of fever or rednessaround a boil but is revising the statement for clarity. The revised warningswill read, ``Do not use on boils on the lips, nose, cheeks, or forehead:Consult a doctor for treatment of boils in these areas'' and ``Do not usethis product for more than 7 days. If condition worsens or does not improve,if fever occurs, or if redness around the boil develops, consult a doctor.''<ITAG tagnum="74">Reference </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment No. C00081, Docket No. 78N-0301, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG>3. The agency is proposing that magnesium sulfate, benzocaine, camphor,ichthammol, juniper tar, and phenol be reclassified from Category II toCategory III and that sulfur be classified in Category III. (See Part II.paragraphs 1. and 2. above.)In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency publisheda final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications foruse of OTC drug products. Under the final rule, the label and labelingof OTC drug products are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuouslocation, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use establishedunder an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing such indications for usethat meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling,which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVEDUSES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on indications, which mayappear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternativelanguage describing indications for use that is not false or misleading,which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All required OTC drug labelingother than indications for use (e.g., statement of identity, warnings,and directions) must appear in the specific wording established under anOTC drug monograph where exact language has been established and identifiedby quotation marks in an applicable monograph or other regulation, e.g.,21 CFR 201.63 or 330.1(g). The proposed rule in this document is subjectto the final rule revising the labeling policy.The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemakingin conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. Ina notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC boil ointmentdrug products, is a major rule.The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L.96-354. That assessment included a discretionary regulatory flexibilityanalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC boil ointment drug products is not expected to pose such an impacton small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposedrule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities.The agency invited public comment in the advance notice of proposed rulemakingregarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC boil ointmentdrug products. No comments on economic impacts were received. Any commentson the agency's initial determination of the economic consequences of thisproposed rulemaking should be submitted by May 25, 1988. The agency willevaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassessthe economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.The agency has determined that under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this actionis of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significantimpact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.Interested persons may, on or before March 28, 1988, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, written comments, objections, or requestsfor oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. Arequest for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and timerequested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determinationmay be submitted on or before May 25, 1988. Three copies of all comments,objections, and requests are to be submitted, except that individuals maysubmit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identifiedwith the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this documentand may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Comments, objections,and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Interested persons, on or before January 26, 1989, may also submit in writingnew data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditionsnot classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submittedon or before March 27, 1989. These dates are consistent with the time periodsspecified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural regulationsfor reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copiesof all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified withthe docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Dataand comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305)(address above). Received data and comments may also be seen in the officeabove between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consideronly data submitted prior to the closing of the administrative record onMarch 27, 1989. Data submitted after the closing of the administrativerecord will be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, unless the Commissioner finds good cause hasbeen shown that warrants earlier consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 358</ITAG>Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Boil treatment drug products.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the AdministrativeProcedure Act, it is proposed that Subchapter D of Chapter I of Title 21of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended in Part 358 (proposed inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 3, 1982; 47 FR 39108), by addingnew Subpart E, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 358_MISCELLANEOUS EXTERNAL DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTERHUMAN USE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Boil Treatment Drug Products</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">358.401 Scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">358.403 Definition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">358.410 Boil treatment active ingredients.
