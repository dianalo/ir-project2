The guide provides a screeningmethodology to identify treatment technologies that may be suitable forthe management of soils and sludges containing CERCLA wastes. For eachof the treatment technologies, information is presented on (a) the genericsystem, (b) individual, unique systems, (c) developmental status, (d)process schematics, (e) characteristics affecting treatment performance,and (f) contacts. Some limited information is also presented about pretreatment,materials handling, and residuals management requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
