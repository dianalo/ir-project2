Local communities and states and individuals and families musthelp.   I'm being told in these meetings of the last few days that theAmerican people are ready to take on this fight.   Late August is a traditional vacation period, but we cannotforget the full agenda that faces America at this time: ourhostages, the Middle East, Lebanon, drugs, the budget, and so manyother matters.   In addition, the Congress is considering more than 100 of ournominees for government positions, and we need these people.   And I urge the Congress to make this a top priority when theycome back.   All of these issues will be on my mind as we prepare for the hardwork of the fall.   And so on this last day before vacation, I'll miss you, but _ letme just see _ Norm?   Q. Mr. President, your spokesman said yesterday that significantprogress had been made in pursuing the issue of the hostages. We'retold that you've been on the phone to foreign leaders, that there'sbeen a flurry of diplomatic contacts. But can you say today thatwe're any closer to seeing the hostages released than we were, say,about three weeks ago when the Israeli seizure of Sheik Obeid setinto motion this chain of developments that seems to have raisedexpectations or hopes of a breakthrough?   A. Norm, I can't say that today, but we're going to keep ontrying.   But I cannot give you a definitive assessment of that.   I just don't know.   There's a lot of lines out there, a lot of initiatives have beentaken.   As I said earlier, the cooperation that we've received, some thatwe've solicited and some unsolicited, from leaders around the world,it's just been magnificent.   But I can't give you that, you know, positive assessment at thispoint.   Q. Can I follow up on just one path that was pursued on that. Inthe absence of an exchange of prisoners, have you considered theextradition of Sheik Obeid to this country to face criminal charges?   A. No, we have no criminal indictment against Sheik Obeid.   Q. Is that any kind of a legal option?   A. Well, we don't _ we wouldn't move against somebody without thelegal process going forward.   Q. Mr. President, what does it mean when you pointedly remindIran that ``goodwill begets goodwill.'' The United States wants thereturn of the hostages in Lebanon. If that occurred, what would theUnited States do in return for Iran?   A. Too hypothetical to answer, but I would simply repeat that weare looking for signs of change, certainly when it comes to holdingof hostages.   We all know that we've had some major differences with Iran andthe question of state sponsorship of terrorism.   That's a given.   Now, we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signalscoming out of Iran, some in the old mode and then some that offermore hope.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
