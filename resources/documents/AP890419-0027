The White House said Tuesday that the Reagan administration hadmade the documents ``available'' in 1987, but did not specificallysay whether they had been turned over to Congress.   The documents, which emerged at Oliver North's criminal trial,spell out President Reagan's approval of a deal in which Hondurasgot more than $110 million in extra U.S. aid as payment forsupporting the Contras in 1985.   Bush informed the Honduran president of the extra aid, but itisn't clear whether the then-U.S. vice president knew theassistance was a payoff for Contra backing. Bush has refused tocomment on what he knew.   ``We address this letter to you personally to underscore thegravity of the matter if there has been, in fact, a failure toproduce these documents to Congress,'' said the letter, releasedTuesday. It was written the previous day by Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.   Inouye was chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra committee andMitchell was a member.   ``We respectfully request that you direct an immediate andthorough investigation and report to determine whether anydocuments were not provided to the Senate Select Committee,''stated the letter.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater responded Tuesday thatall documents identified in the letter from Mitchell and Inouye``were available to the independent counsel and the Iran-contrainvestigating committee.''   He added that ``all such documents related to the Iran-contracase were certainly accessible to the independent counsel, theFederal Bureau of Investigation, and the Iran-contra committee.''   The congressional Iran-Contra committees uncovered third-countrysupport for the Contras, but it didn't turn up the quid pro quoarrangements which helped secure the foreign Contra backing.   The Honduran deal was part of a secret approach the Reaganadministration made to at least 11 countries in which it soughthelp for the rebel force due to a congressional cutoff in U.S.military aid.   Another document sought by the senators describes Reagan'sapparent approval of airdropping intelligence and rifles to theContras to destroy arms-bearing ships headed for Nicaragua. Thedocument, dated Oct. 30, 1985, also concerns reconnaissanceoverflights of Nicaragua.   Another document sought by Mitchell and Inouye spells outReagan's phone call to Honduran President Robert Suazo Cordovawhich resulted in the release of a Contra-bound arms shipment theHonduran military had seized.   Mitchell and Inouye also asked for ``other documents related tothese matters.''   Documents on Honduras which emerged at North's trial describehow the Reagan administration conditioned extra aid to Honduras onContra support and the lengths to which the administration went tokeep such arrangements secret from Congress.   An interagency Crisis Pre-Planning Group on Feb. 7, 1985,approved an agreement under which Reagan would send a letter to theHonduran president urging Contra support and offering severalinducements.   The enticements included speeded-up deliveries of militarysupplies, release of economic assistance and CIA support.   Reagan's letter urging Contra support was to be followed by thevisit of an emissary who would orally outline the conditionsattached to the extra aid. The CPPG didn't want to include thedetail of the quid pro quo arrangement in writing.   North and NSC staffer Raymond Burghardt subsequently becameconcerned over how the plan was to be carried out.   There was to be no special emissary conditioning the extra aidon Contra support. Instead, U.S. Ambassador to Honduras JohnNegroponte was to deliver the text of Reagan's letter and to take asofter approach, saying that Reagan had directed extra assistance.   ``To date, all administration officials have been able to stateto the Congress that we have not approached any other government tosupport the resistance,'' North and NSC colleague Raymond Burghardtsaid in a Feb. 20, 1985, memo. The memo to then-national securityadviser Robert McFarlane is one of the documents the two senatorswant included in a review by Bush.   If the State Department's approach is carried out, ``we will nolonger be able to make such a claim and any of the appropriatecommittees may place a call for all relevant cables on this matterat any time,'' said the memo.   ``Amb Negroponte, who will be called upon to testify during hisconfirmation hearings for assistant secretary, will undoubtedly bequeried on whether or not such overtures were made to theHondurans.''   The North-Burghardt memo said that ``notwithstanding our owninterpretations'' of the Boland amendment cutting off military aidto the Contras ``it is very clear from the colloquy during thedebate ... that the legislative intent was to deny any direct orindirect support for the military-paramilitary operations inNicaragua.'' The amendment had gone into effect in October 1984.   ``In short, the decision to proceed without an emissary placesboth Amb Negroponte and our hopes with the Hill at increasedjeopardy. We still believe that our original concept of an emissaryis the proper way in which to proceed.''   North and Burghardt apparently prevailed.   North wrote a followup memo on Feb. 25, 1985, saying thatReagan's signed letter urging Contra support ``will be delivered''to Suazo by Burghardt.</TEXT></DOC>
