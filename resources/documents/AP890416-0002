His story is an example of what Roman Catholic priests, lawyersand civil rights workers say are continuing, widespread violationsof human rights despite President Corazon Aquino's oft-statedcommitment to social justice.   Bustamante, now 19, says he and a companion were grabbed on aManila street in March 1988 while putting up posters protestingU.S. military bases. He says they were taken to a militarygarrison, tortured, driven to a remote field and dumped.   His companion was found dead and police say they still have noleads. Bustamante fears for his life and has given up pursuing thecase.   Mrs. Aquino denies that her government sanctions such abuse. Themilitary says it is weeding out offenders and indoctrinatingsoldiers out of respect for human rights.   In December, however, the human rights organization AmnestyInternational reported ``a pattern of torture'' in the Philippinesas a result of the government's intensified campaign againstcommunist insurgents.   Critics of Mrs. Aquino say she is reluctant to crack down onabuses by the military because she needs loyal officers to remainin power and fulfill her pledge to crush the rebels.   Some claim violations of human rights are more widespread nowthan under Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was driven into exile inFebruary 1986 by the military-civilian uprising that put Mrs.Aquino in office.   Task Force Detainees, affiliated with the Catholic church, says8,367 people were detained in 1987 on suspicion of links to rebelgroups, compared with 5,967 reported arrested in 1985, the lastfull year Marcos was in office. It claims one of four arrested aretortured.   The organization documented 98 massacres in 1987 compared with54 in 1985, including 17 people slain in Lupao in February 1987 andat least 13 protesters killed during a Manila march for land reformin January 1987.   Although the military acknowledges soldiers were responsible,there have been no convictions in either case.   Her own government's Commission on Human Rights says only 12people have been convicted of human rights violations since Mrs.Aquino replaced Marcos.   Amnesty's report blamed the abuses on military and paramilitaryunits, including hundreds of anti-communist vigilante groupsorganized since 1987 to help fight the rebels.   The president called the report unfair, but those active in thehuman rights movement say little is done to identify and punishoffenders. Victims usually keep silent for fear of reprisal.   Priests and lawyers say the military frequently calls a wholevillage communist if rebels operate in the area and choosescivilians for arrest and torture on flimsy evidence.   Leticia Buenaseda, a lawyer for the Commission on Human Rightson Samar Island, said she received threats from the military andsoldiers ransacked her office after she began investigating thedisappearances of several civilians. Six human rights lawyers havebeen killed since October 1987.   An Irish priest in Mindanao, the Rev. Michael Sinnot, said thearmy's conduct was driving civilians into the insurgent ranks.   He described the military as ``the best recruiting agency'' forthe rebels.   ``For every abuse they commit, for every one person they kill,they recruit five people more,'' Sinnot said.   Human rights activists fear the situation will get worse as thearmy deploys a new civilian militia called the Citizens ArmedForces Geographical Unit.   Military officials say the 50,000 militiamen will be sent toremote villages to improve security but will be under tightcontrol. Critics claim the militias and vigilante groups arevirtual ``death squads.''   Augusto Sanchez, a human rights lawyer and former Aquino laborminister, said police and soldiers go after anyone with liberal orleftist views.   ``The `red scare' has generated feelings among the right-wingforces, the military and the police that anybody tainted orcommunist-branded is due for liquidation,'' he said.   The Rev. Rafael Donato, chairman of the Association of MajorReligious Superiors, said he referred several cases to Mrs. Aquino,Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos and the chief of staff, Gen. Renatode Villa, with no results.   ``All of them said `we will investigate, we will investigate, wewill investigate,' but nothing happens,'' he said.   Many of Mrs. Aquino's critics blame the influence of themilitary, which grew as Ramos and others put down six coup attemptsand army activity against the insurgents increased.   Ramos was chief of staff when the coups were crushed. UnderMarcos he commanded the Philippine Constabulary, the nationalpolice force believed responsible for most of the violations, butnever was personally identified with human rights abuse.   Soon after gaining power, Mrs. Aquino established the Commissionon Human Rights. Its only recourse, however, is to refer cases tomilitary courts, which have sole power to prosecute soldiers evenwhen the victims are civilians.   ``While there were attempts to fulfill promises, I believe shewas shocked into submission by the series of coups d'etat,'' saidArnel de Guzman, chairman of the Ecumenical Movement for Justiceand Peace. ``She is a hostage of the military or some otherforces.''   Hesiquio Mallilin, a former human rights lawyer who heads thehuman rights commission, acknowledged that abuses have continued,but said his agency ``is doing its best to improve the situation.''   The Rev. Brendan O'Connell, an Irish priest on Negros island,said of Mrs. Aquino's image abroad: ``They see this lovely personand say, `This is not true because human rights is the policy ofthis government.'''   At home, he said, ``People from the ... slum areas, they say,`This beautiful woman is like the Baby Jesus, who will save us.'   ``That's why I think she's part of the problem.''</TEXT></DOC>
