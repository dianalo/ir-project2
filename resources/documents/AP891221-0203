She got 9-year-old Tarek hisfavorite Transformer robots but his fondest wish is not to be.   She can't bring his father home.   ``Christmas was very special for my husband,'' said Mrs. Reed.This will be the fourth Christmas in captivity for Frank Reed, oneof the eight American hostages in Lebanon.   ``He would start getting things ready a month ahead of time.He'd have the Christmas carols on every day and plan on who we'regoing to invite. He would cook the turkey himself.''   For Mrs. Reed, a Syrian national, and Tarek, it is their firstChristmas in America, far from friends and from husband and father.   ``I miss him a lot,'' said Tarek, who uses the present tensewhen relating memories of his father.   ``He usually sees me when I play with the turtles,'' said Tarek,referring to his pets. ``We usually walk on the grass and talk.''   Reed, the American director of the Lebanese InternationalSchool, was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986. Tarek wasn't quite 6 then.   Now, the boy and his mother plead the case of the hostageswherever they can, from the Glenwood School where Tarek is in thethird grade to university halls to the White House.   ``Dear Mr. Bush, please free my father,'' he began a letter tothe president. He signed it, ``Your friend, Tarek Reed.'' Hisclassmates wore yellow ribbons and wrote similar letters toPresident Bush but there has been no reply. Tarek brought in a9-by-12-inch photo of his father and showed it to his classmates.   ``That was touching.'' said his teacher, Trudy LaSpina. ``He wasvery proud. He was pleased with what we were doing.''   These are the two faces of Tarek: A boy propelled far beyond hisage trying to face the realities of the civil war in Lebanon (``Thelast time when the bombings started, everyone thought it wasthunder,'' he said). A kid in his natural world of fantasy wheretoy dinosaurs and robots are the good guys he often talks about inthe games he plays.   During a religious ceremony, he placed a photo of his fatherbeneath a ``Tree of Freedom,'' a Christmas tree decorated in memoryof the eight American hostages. In the next instant, while aprivate Mass was being said for the hostages in a home, Tarek wasin the next room drawing in a coloring book with 7-year-oldMichael, his newfound friend.   If anything, Tarek is doing better than his mother in thesepainful times. He walks to school alone, something that would havebeen unheard of in Beirut. Recently he went around the neighborhoodselling candy bars for a school fund-raiser, astounding his mother.He's forgotten much of his Arabic.   ``It's just like he was born here,'' said Mrs. Reed. ``He hasfriends. He goes around so sure of himself.''   But the 38-year-old woman said she is not adjusting well. ``I'mnot young. When you come to a country and you're young, you adjusteasily. ... Everything is so different, the customs, the habits.''   Mrs. Reed said she is not alive, she is only existing. ``Peopletend to think you're fine, you're just as happy as other peopleare. But it's not true because we're not. You can pretend to behappy but deep inside you're not that happy. You want your husbandaround and you want the comfort of a family.''   Mrs. Reed and Tarek came here last summer on vacation but theystayed when fighting intensified in Beirut and it appeared theschools there would not open for the fall term. She moved in withher mother-in-law in Malden and took a job with an insurancecompany in Boston, a 30-minute commute.   As she waits and hopes for her husband's release, her emotionsrise and fall.   ``There are days when you think it's going to happen and it'sgetting close. And there are days when it's just getting out ofhand, it's getting impossible, `Aw come on, come on, come on. Whatis going on? Let's do something.'   ``I'm angry. Who gave them (the captors) the right to do this?Where's the justice? By what right can the people take somebody'slife and decide they're going to put them in jail? Why?''   In the midst of these thoughts, she had asked herself, ``Howmuch more can I take?''   Jean-Paul Kauffmann, a French journalist who was released bypro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors in May 1988, told her about thetreatment of the hostages, and she said it ``just blew my mind.   ``They'd be blindfolded most of the time. They'd be shoved thefood in a dirty dish under the door a lot of times. If they caughtthem talking to each other, they would beat them.''   She agonizes over how her husband is holding up, the conditionhe will be in when he is released. ``How much sanity are theyretaining, being there three years? I don't know. ... Is the persongoing to come out normal? Frank is not young. He's 56.''   The thoughts that race through her mind are not all haunting.There are the good memories of how they met and married in 1977when she was in training as a teacher at the International School.And they were the best of times, as the couple faced together theobjections of her parents because he was American and Protestantand she was Syrian and Moslem. He later converted to her religion.   ``We had to try to convince them we wanted to get married. Wewere just the right people for each other. This is the time Iremember. We just had a great time together. I used to say, `It'stoo nice to be true,' and it was too nice to be true. It ended allof a sudden.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Esper is the AP Northeast regionalreporter, based in Boston.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 22-24</NOTE></DOC>
