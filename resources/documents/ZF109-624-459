 Today, 250,000 adults run layouts rangingfrom simple circles to routes that look like bowls of noodles.andP;  If you hankerto follow in Casey Jones's tracks but lack the space or money to build ascale model system, a PC-based simulatin might be the next best thing.andM;PC-Railroad is the least expensive way to get into PC model railroading.andP;  Itis available on several shareware bulletin board services and can also beordered from TWD-Freeware for just $6.50.andP;  PC-Railroad's 26-track layoutshave descriptive names like 5loops, Quilt, Yards, and Turnouts.andP;  You can alsouse a utility program to create track layouts and trains.andM;The tracks are shown diagrammatically as white lines on a black backgroundwith alphabetic letters at switching points.andP;  To open or close a switch youpress the appropriate key.andP;  The track systems I tried all had five trainsthat you can pilot around the layout.andP;  Each train's speed is regulated by apair of function keys.andP;  F1, for example, increases train number 1's speed; F2throttles it back to stop and then into reverse.andM;Collisions on PC-Railroad are impossible.andP;  Travel is regulated by a blocksystem, just like on real railroads, so that two trains cannot be on the samesegment of track.andP;  But even setting a switch incorrectly will not derailthese trains.andM;Design Your Own Train, from Abracadata, is not so forgiving; set a switchincorrectly and you'll end up with a twisted mess of iron and steelrepresented by a black screen that says, simply, &quot;Wait a sec....&quot;andM;Design Your Own Train is very similar to PC-RR, but offers color andmore-detailed graphics.andP;  Rails are represented by parallel lines and thereare building, factory, and station icons.andP;  Instead of running purposelesslyaround a track, trains can stop at stations and factories to load and unloadpassengers and freight.andM;I particularly enjoyed creating my own railroad, the Zandamp;X, and spent morehours than I intended adding switches, crossovers, and loops, even though theswitch icons are so poorly designed that it's hard to find the one you want.andO;I finally had to make a key on a scrap of paper.andP;  On the positive side,Design Your Own Train is realistic in the types of track intersections andswitches it allows-- no 90-degree turns here.andP;  there's a paint program andmouse support so you don't have to use the canned factories and stations onyour road.andM;Although Design Your Own Train has a pull-down menu system, it is oftenconfusing and nonsensical.andP;  Moving the mouse highlights menu items like File,Create, and Run, but then you must pull back on the mouse to pull down themenu choices.andP;  The customer service people say the menu system is going to beredesigned.andM;The labelling of switches is another sore point.andP;  In one case, at a crowdedcrossover point on the Zandamp;X, the program mislabeled a switch.andP;  causingrepeated wrecks and untold loss of life.andP;  The location of switch labelsshould be under user control.andM;While PC-Railroad and Design Your Own Train limit track layout to a singlescreen, Railroad Tycoon, from MicroProse, gives you the world.andP;  Tycoon ismore than a model railroad; it is the ultimate in railroad simulation.andM;First you select the area in which you want to operate your railroad; easternor western U.S., England, or Europe.andP;  Then you set other parameters like thedufficulty level (investor to tycoon), the economy (basic to complex), thecompetition (friendly or cutthroat), and the mode of operation (collisionsallowed).andP;  After that you can think about surveying rigths-of-way, buildingtracks, bridging rivers, and constructing stations.andP;  Realism and toughdecisions are everywhere: A wooden trestle costs $50,000 (in 1820 dollars),but is susceptible to washout, while a masonry bridge costs $400,000 and isalmost indestructible.andM;Once a railroad is in operation you have to worry about things like strikes,competition, and takeovers.andP;  All of this, including the theory of railroadoperation, is explained in the 180-page manual.andP;  It's enough to intimidateanyone whose last name isn't Vanderbilt.andM;You can ease into railroading by starting at the tutorial level with theCharlottesville and Richmond line.andP;  Pick up coal at Charlottesville Junction,haul it to a steel mill in Charlottes-ville proper, carry the steel to afactory in Richmond, and then return with a load of products.andM;As the game progresses, year after year, decade after decade, you can expandrail service to passengers and mail, and later double track the main line.andO;Eventually, you get to retire.andM;It's hard to find fault with Railroad Tycoon.andP;  It is plainly a labor of loveby a dedicated group of railroad enthusiasts, and its minutiae will surelyappeal to those who are equally dedicated.andP;  The price is a bargain.andP;  My ownfavorite simulator, though--notwithstanding its flaws, quirks, andoverpricing--is Design Your Own Train.andM;I like laying out the road without having to worry about costs and grades andbridges, and I love switching trains around tracks and stations withoutregard to economic factors.andP;  I'm totally enthralled by railroadcollisions--the lack of which explains why PC-Railroad is my least favoriteof this trio.andM;List Price: PC-Railroad, $6.50.andM;Requires: 256K RAM, DOS 2.1 or later, graphics monitor and adapter.andO;Shareware; also available from TWD-Freeware, P.O.
