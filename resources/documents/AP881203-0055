Leaders of the National League for Democracy expelled Aung Gyiafter he asked the party on Nov. 25 to remove eight communist orpro-communist members, accusing them of ``engaging in activitiesdetrimental to the interest of the league as well as that of thedemocratic process.''   Aung Gyi said he would ``continue the struggle for democracy''under the banner of a new party, the Union National Democracy Party.   After the chairman's expulsion, the pro-communist members wereallowed to retain membership in the National League for Democracy.   The party was formed Sept. 27 by Aung Gyi and two otheropposition leaders, Aung San Suu Kyi and Gen. Tin Oo, to opposeBurma's military rulers. The opposition also contests the generalelections planned by the ruling National Unity Party which, underanother name, has governed Burma since a 1962 military coup as thesole legal party.   More than 500,000 people have enrolled as members of the NationalLeague for Democracy, making it the strongest of the oppositiongroups.   Western analysts have said the opposition must unify to defeatthe ruling party.   Following weeks of violence and pro-democracy demonstrations, themilitary under Gen. Saw Maung staged a Sept. 18 coup and ruthlesslyput down pro-democracy opponents. By official count, his troops havekilled more than 450 people since the coup.   The general has promised general elections and allowed 157political parties to register, but no election date has been set.   Opposition leaders say the tight control over virtually everyaspect of life indicates free and fair elections will not bepossible.   Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of assassinated national heroAung San. Tin Oo is a former defense minister fired by former ruleNe Win, who seized power in the 1962 military coup and led Burma for26 years on a road of isolation, political repression and economicruin.   Ne Win formally retired in July, but diplomats say he still isthe real power in Burma. After Ne Win's resignation, two otherleaders preceded Saw Maung, whose rise to power diplomats believewas engineered by the former leader.</TEXT></DOC>
