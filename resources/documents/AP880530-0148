It did not say how it would do this.   The EEC development commissioner, Lorenzo Natali, met inBrussels on Friday with South African church leaders from severaldenominations and with leaders of the Kagiso Trust, a South Africangroup that aids victims of apartheid.   EEC officials said Monday that Natali assured them of EECsupport of those who ``use all pacific means to fight for theabolition of apartheid.''   The Common Market has earmarked $30.6 million for humanitarianaid to South African opposition groups in 1988, up from $24 millionin 1987 and $12 million in 1986.   The religious leaders urged the EEC to pressure South Africainto shelving a bill _ now before South Africa's Parliament andlikely to be adopted later this year _ which will let thegovernment seize funds from abroad if it believes these will beused for political activities.   South African churches and church groups rely heavily on foreignfunding. Under the bill, they would need government approval to getforeign aid.   Last week, an all-party group in the European Parliament urgedthe EEC to increase economic sanctions against South Africa if ittightens up its anti-apartheid legislation.   In 1986, the EEC banned new investments in South Africa andhalted imports of iron, steel and gold coins from the country.   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
