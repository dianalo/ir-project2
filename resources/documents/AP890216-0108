Also today, the Afghan foreign minister said the government hasasked the United Nations to set up outposts along the border withPakistan to stem the flow of arms to Moslem guerrillas.   In the attack on Kabul by U.S.-backed guerrillas, one rocketlanded outside a house in western Kabul, killing three childrenplaying in the street, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Anotheryoung girl was killed and her mother's legs were blown off but shesurvived, the spokesman said.   Less than a half mile away, a rocket struck near a powertransmission station, killing a bus driver and two men, the officialsaid. Five people were injured in the rocket attack, said thespokesman, who demanded anonymity.   Rebel rockets also hit near a Sikh community and the airport,which was closed today because of heavy snow.   Mohammad Badakhshi, who lost his 11-year-old daughter in today'sattack, asked ``Who is doing this?'' Speaking to foreign reporters,he added: ``I've lost my daughter, and now I'm losing my mind.''   About 105 miles to the south in Ghazni city, rebel rockets killedsix people, Radio Kabul said in a report monitored in Islamabad,Pakistan. Radio Kabul said 34 guerrillas were killed in fightingduring the previous 24 hours. The radio also charged that 600Pakistani troops marched toward Ghazni on Friday to carry out``terrorist activities.'' It said some were deployed in the garrisontown of Urgun about 15 miles from the Pakistani border.   Pakistani officials had no immediate reaction, but they havedenied previous accusations by the Afghan government that theyplanned to invade the eastern city of Jalalabad.   The Soviet Union on Wednesday ended nine years of militaryintervention in Afghanistan, leaving Afghan troops alone in theirfight against the guerrillas.   In his comments today, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil ofAfghanistan accused Britain, France and other Western nationsopposed to Afghanistan's Marxist government of blocking emergencyairlifts of food into Kabul, which is facing severe shortages. Anofficial with the United Nations, which is coordinating the airlift,declined to comment on Wakil's statement.   Some Western officials have predicted that the Afghan army willbe unable to prevent Kabul and other major Afghan cities from beingtaken by Pakistani-based Moslem guerrilla forces now that the Sovietforces are gone.   The foreign minister said Afghanistan has asked the U.N. GoodOffice Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan to set up outposts nearsix towns along the border. The agency, UNGOMAP, monitors compliancewith the Geneva accord signed in April that paved the way for thewithdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Red Army troops and called onAfghanistan and Pakistan to stop interfering in each other'sinternal affairs.   Wakil said Afghanistan has asked that outposts be set up near thetowns of Quttarr, Landi Kotall, Torkahn, Chaman, Spin Boldak andParchinarr.   ``We have requested that UNGOMAP establish outposts along theborder to prevent the open transport of arms, ammunition and otherdeadly weapons into Afghanistan from Pakistan,'' he said.   On Wednesday, Najib thanked Moscow for its military support andaccused the United States of trampling on the accord for the Sovietwithdrawal.   The government said in a statement that Washington's support forthe guerrillas had sharply risen since the accord was signed inApril.</TEXT></DOC>
