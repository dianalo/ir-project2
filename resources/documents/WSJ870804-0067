But when KUNM, a public radio station here licensed to the University of New Mexico, decided to switch the type of songs it plays, many longtime listeners refused to tune out.    For 20 years, KUNM has featured &quot;Freeform&quot; broadcasting, an eclectic blend of music and cultural perspectives that one disk jockey describes as &quot;anything from Mozart to Motown to high Andes folk music.&quot; A 10-year volunteer deejay at the station, &quot;Mr. Hot Lix,&quot; mixes golden oldies with pointed commentary on conditions in New Mexico prisons and plays requests from inmates.    But two months ago, station management decided to replace the daytime Freeform format with jazz and classical music. Now, thousands of Freeform followers are fighting the move. They've taken the station to court and have succeeded, temporarily, in freezing the FM station's bank accounts, asserting the station misled listeners during fund-raising drives.    &quot;It's like something straight out of the '60s,&quot; says listener Kate Babchuk. On more than one occasion, riot-ready police have stood guard while protestors rallied, denouncing KUNM and university officials, and carrying signs reading &quot;We don't need another yupped-up station.&quot;    The static has been heavy inside the station, too. More than 50 of KUNM's mostly volunteer staff quit after several were suspended for commenting about the change on the air. A lawsuit filed by the volunteer staff asserts the format change violates its free-speech rights.    A listener lawsuit also seeks to restore Freeform programming. John Walker, a lawyer for about 2,300 listener subscribers argues that &quot;listeners are, in a sense, shareholders in the station. They should have a say in what they want to hear.&quot;    A shortage of disk jockeys has forced KUNM managers to broadcast on an abbreviated schedule, but it didn't stop them from instituting the new programming last weekend. Program manager Patrick Conley says the decision was made after a study found Freeform drew only 1,000 listeners each quarter hour, half the audience of three years ago. Says Mr. Conley, &quot;Freeform just doesn't keep up with consumer demands.&quot;    Chris Martin, a suspended volunteer disk jockey, however, insists the study was bogus. &quot;It was geared toward white male, beer-drinking yuppies,&quot; she says, &quot;who just want to listen to Madonna.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
