Royal Trustco had a fourth-quarter loss of 251 millionCanadian dollars (US$216 million), or C$2.17 a share,compared with net income of C$72 million, or 40 Canadiancents a share, a year earlier.   The bulk of the loss came from C$172 million in loanlosses and restructuring costs at the company's troubledEuropean operations. Royal Trustco also reported loan-lossprovisions of C$30 million from its North American operationsand a loss of C$84 on investments in six U.S. savings andloan companies.   Michael Cornelissen, president and chief executiveofficer, said that the European losses were mainly due to a&quot;collapse of the property market&quot; in Britain.   The company said the restructuring of the Europeanoperations is complete and &quot;eliminates the possibility of anyfuture recurrence of loan losses of this kind or magnitude.&quot;Royal Trustco said it expects to be profitable this year,subject to economic conditions.   The unusual fourth-quarter items resulted in a loss forthe year of C$65 million, or C$1.20 a share, compared withnet income of C$265 million, or C$1.70 a share, in 1989.   Royal Trustco said it plans to boost capital through aC$200 million rights offering to shareholders. A spokesmanfor Royal Trustco, a financial-services concern 49% held byTrilon Financial Corp., which is controlled by Toronto'sBronfman family, said the latest year's loss reduced RoyalTrustco's risk-adjusted capital ratio to about 8%.   The spokesman said the rights issue is expected to restorethe ratio to about 10%, which is above industry requirementsof 7.2%. Trilon has committed C$100 million to exercise itsrights.   Standard andamp; Poor's said it placed Royal Trustco's seniordebt, which has a single-A-plus rating, on its CreditWatchlist with negative implications.
