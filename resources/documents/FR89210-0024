This revision includes reasonably availablecontrol technology (RACT) determinations for four processes at SpaldingCorporation. The uncontrolled potential emissions of these four processesare greater than 100 tons per year (TPY) and are not covered by an EPApublished Control Technique Guideline (CTG) document.Massachusetts submitted a regulation, 310 CMR 7.18(17), requiring RACTon all such non-CTG sources as part of its approved 1982 Ozone AttainmentPlan (48 FR 51480). In a November 17, 1982 letter to EPA, the DEQE committedto submit each of the 100 TPY individual RACT determinations to EPA forincorporation into the Massachusetts SIP as a source-specific SIP revision.This revision includes a Plan Approval and a proposed Amendment to thatPlan Approval proposed by the DEQE to impose RACT on four processes atSpalding that are not covered by a CTG. This is in accordance with SIPRegulation 310 CMR 7.18(17). The DEQE has calculated that the VOC emissionsat Spalding will be reduced from 541.2 TPY in 1982 to 126.3 TPY in 1986(a 76.7% reduction) as a result of imposing RACT.The RACT control plan, as specified in the October 7, 1985 Plan Approvaland the proposed Amendment dated December 9, 1987, requires that Spaldingmeet the following emission rates by September 30, 1986:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) 0.0158 pounds VOC per dozen golf balls;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) 0.0104 pounds VOC per golf club; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) 0.0014 pounds VOC per inflatable ball.</ITAG>Additionally Spalding is required to emit, on an after control basis, lessthan 100 TPY. Formulation data for each coating used on these three manufacturingprocesses is to be kept on site and may be checked by Reference Method24. The DEQE's proposed Plan Approval states that compliance with the emissionlimitations will be done on a monthly averaging time basis. The proposedPlan Approval also requires Spalding to install a tamper-proof countingsystem for the golf ball manufacturing process.These emission limits are not acceptable to EPA as RACT as currently drafted.Because Spalding makes different types of golf balls, golf clubs and inflatableballs, a limit on total emissions from each of these processes constitutesa bubble. Morever, as DEQE has specified that each processes' emissionrate is to be met on a monthly averaged basis, these emission rates constitutea bubble control strategy involving long-term (greater than 24 hours) averaging.DEQE's SIP revision request does not meet EPA's December 4, 1986 EmissionTrading Policy (51 FR 43814). In particular it does not meet Appendix Dof that policy, the January 20, 1984 memorandum entitled ``Averaging Timesfor Compliance with VOC Emission Limits_SIP Revision Policy.'' For thesereasons, EPA is requiring that the Plan Approval and proposed Amendmentbe amended to specify emission rates in pounds of VOC per gallon of coating(minus water and photochemically reactive solvents) for each coating/paintingoperation in the manufacturing of golf balls, golf clubs, and inflatableballs, before EPA will take final action on this determination.Additionally the DEQE's RACT determination requires the following changesin Spalding's manufacturing processes to reduce the emissions of VOCs:<ITAG tagnum="84">Golf Balls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Elimination of a second coat of paint</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Reduction of overspray</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Increased solids use in the urethane topcoat</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Mechanical stripping of rejected golf balls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Cessation of chemical stripping of rejected golf balls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Changes in the spray booth design</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Golf clubs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Elimination of the finish spray operation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Inflated balls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Elimination of the painting of basketballs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Employment of a cleaning tool that uses less VOC</ITAG>EPA has reviewed the proposed Plan Approval and supporting documents submittedby the DEQE regarding this RACT determination. EPA generally concurs withthe DEQE's determination for reducing VOCs at Spalding Corporation. However,EPA believes that this RACT determination is not enforceable as writtenbecause of the emission limits, compliance date and recordkeeping and reportingrequirements. The RACT reductions, therefore, may not be achieved.The SIP revision must be amended, as indicated below, in order for EPAto take final action to approve it.(1) The Plan Approval must be amended to require emission limits in poundsof VOC per gallon of coating (minus water and photochemically nonreactivesolvents) for each coating/painting manufacturing process; compliance withthese limits must be determined through Reference Method 24.(2) The calculation methods to be used to determine compliance must beincluded as part of the formal SIP submittal.(3) The Plan Approval must be amended to require as an enforceable condition,the use of the maintenance/tool room unit that emits fewer VOCs.(4) The December 9, 1987 proposed Amendment to the Plan Approval must berevised to specifically require as <T3>conditions</T3>:<ITAG tagnum="15">a. A final compliance date no later than December 31, 1986 (DEQE hasindicated a September 30, 1986 date),</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">b. That the formulations for all coatings be maintained on site andmade available to DEQE and/or EPA upon request,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">c. That the VOC content of the formulations will be determined byReference Method 24,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">d. Recordkeeping requirements sufficient to determine compliance.</ITAG>(5) A copy of the recordkeeping forms to be used for reporting compliancemust be included in the formal SIP submittal.The amendments to the Plan Approval and Amendment must be incorporatedinto the version of those documents formally submitted as a revision forEPA's final approval and incorporation into the SIP. If DEQE's final PlanApproval and Amendment do not incorporate the requirements outlined inthis notice, EPA will withdraw this proposed approval action and take actionto disapprove DEQE's SIP revision request.EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this noticeor on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered beforetaking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federalrulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the address above.These revisions are being proposed under a procedure called ``parallelprocessing'' (47 CFR Part 27073). If the proposed revisions are substantiallychanged, in areas other than those identified in this notice, EPA willevaluate those changes and may publish a revised NPR. If no substantialchanges are made other than those areas cited in this notice, EPA willpublish a Final Rulemaking Notice on the revisions. The final rulemakingaction by EPA will occur only after the SIP revisions have been adoptedby Massachusetts and submitted to EPA for incorporation into the SIP. ``Parallelprocessing'', it is estimated, will reduce the time necessary for finalapproval of these SIP revisions by 3 to 4 months.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve the DEQE's proposed RACT determination forthe four non-CTG processes at Spalding Corporation. Final EPA approvalis contingent upon the DEQE amending its Plan Approval and Amendment tothat Plan Approval, as indicated in this notice, prior to their formalsubmittal to EPA for incorporation into the SIP. If DEQE's final Plan Approvaland Amendment do not incorporate the requirements outlined in this notice,EPA will withdraw this proposed approval action and take action to disapproveDEQE's SIP revision request.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709).The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the plan revisionswill be based on whether it meets the requirements of sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K)and 110 (a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR Part 51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael R.
