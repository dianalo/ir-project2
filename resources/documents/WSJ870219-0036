In addition, the Cheverly, Md.-based food-service company dismissed its outside auditor, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co., after the accounting firm reported &quot;certain material weaknesses&quot; in Allegheny's internal accounting controls, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Allegheny.    The loss in the latest quarter, which ended Dec. 27, included pre-tax charges of $30.1 million. An Allegheny spokeman said the charges mainly resulted from Service America Corp., the company's troubled food-service unit. Allegheny officials weren't available to provide further explanation of the charges.    In the year-earlier quarter, Allegheny earned $4.1 million, or 58 cents a share, on revenue of $267.9 million. Revenue in the latest quarter increased 4.3% to $279.4 million.    As previously reported, Allegheny has been strapped for cash because of its heavy debt load. Last fall, the company announced plans to sell its Service America unit to pay down debt. Later, the company surprised Wall Street by announcing plans to &quot;leverage&quot; Service America's assets to raise money and then to spin off the unit's stock to shareholders and employees. As part of that restructuring plan, Allegheny also sold its Macke Building Service Inc. unit to New York-based ISS International Service Systems Inc. The price wasn't disclosed. Allegheny also proposed selling its retail office furniture operations.    Last month, the company surprised investors again by suspending its semiannual dividend of 20 cents a share and by announcing that it would have to take a write-down of unspecified size for the third quarter, mostly related to vending machines appraisals and acquisition costs.    Investors seemed to interpret favorably the latest charges and the decision against selling or spinning off the food-service business. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Allegheny closed at $5.50, up 37.5 cents.    &quot;It doesn't sound like they've solved any problems, but it looks like they're facing up to them,&quot; said Eugene P. Goodrich, an analyst at Black andamp; Co. in Portland, Ore. &quot;They're writing down everything they can to get the bad news out of the way, and they have identified the weaknesses in the corporation.&quot;    In a prepared statement, Allegheny blamed its poor earnings results on low volume and &quot;changes in the business mix&quot; of Service America's vending-machine and cafeteria operations, which have suffered from the slump affecting heavy-industry clients.    The company's statement said the latest quarter's pre-tax charge included $8.3 million for a write-down of property, equipment and spare parts; $14.1 million from adjustments to the carrying value of intangible acquisition costs; and $6.8 million for uncollectible accounts and other receivables. The Allegheny spokesman declined to comment on the relation of the charges to Service America.    The Allegheny spokesman declined to quantify Service America's losses, but said that the unit accounts for about 85% of the company's total operations.    The losses at Service America have left Allegheny unable to find either an attractive bid for the unit or the financing for a spinoff, according to the spokesman. Allegheny said it currently plans to place &quot;major emphasis&quot; on improving the unit's performance. The company didn't say how it would accomplish that goal.    Based on past performance, some analysts view the future of the unit skeptically. &quot;Only time will tell whether they can straighten it out,&quot; said Charles T. Akre, an analyst with Johnston, Lemon andamp; Co. in Washington, D.C.    Allegheny declined to comment on its decision to hire Laventhol andamp; Horwath as outside auditor in place of Peat Marwick. Peat Marwick said it was dismissed by Allegheny Feb. 2, but declined to comment further.    According to the SEC filing, however, Peat Marwick met with Allegheny officials last summer to raise concerns about the competence and performance of the company's senior financial management. Peat Marwick at that time threatened to quit as Allegheny's auditor and said it wouldn't issue any &quot;comfort letters&quot; in connection with public offerings of Allegheny stock without a complete audit, or issue any quarterly reports, according to the filing.    Peat Marwick's complaints included concerns about Allegheny's senior financial management and &quot;aggressive internal profitability goals&quot; in Allegheny's budget process, according to the filing.    Allegheny, in response, then appointed its executive vice president to oversee the company's financial management, and Peat Marwick believed &quot;progress&quot; was being made, according to the filing. Peat Marwick decided to continue its contract with Allegheny, but Allegheny's audit committee recommended replacing Peat Marwick earlier this month, the filing said.    For the fiscal first nine months, the company had a loss of $53.4 million, on revenue of $819.5 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $65.1 million, or $8.85 a share, on revenue of $737.3 million. </TEXT></DOC>
