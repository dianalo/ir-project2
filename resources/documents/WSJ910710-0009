Three tiny bits of information in a huge program that ranseveral million lines were set incorrectly, omittingalgorithms -- computation procedures -- that would havestopped the signaling system from becoming congested withmessages, said Frank Perpiglia, DSC's senior vice president,technology and product development. He testified yesterdaybefore the House telecommunications panel about the networkoutages.</LP><TEXT>   DSC manufactures the signaling systems -- a high-speednetworks that carry signals to set up a call but not the callitself -- involved in the series of network disruptions. Ineach case, signaling equipment and software from DSC failedunder an avalanche of computer-generated messages indicatingtrouble or congestion on the network.   Mr. Perpiglia said the Pacific Bell unit of PacificTelesis Group had requested software changes involvingperhaps three or four lines of code. Engineers decided thatbecause the change was minor, the massive program didn't needto undergo the rigorous 13-week test that most software isput through before it is shipped to customers. &quot;With greathindsight, that was an absolute mistake,&quot; he conceded. ByApril or May, the new version of the software had beeninstalled in 50 DSC signal transfer points, which are bigcomputers that control the signaling systems.   Last week, DSC, which has won praise from itsphone-company customers for working around the clock toresolve the crisis, installed a software &quot;patch&quot; designed tosiphon off and discard excess network messages. Given a heavyload of telephone traffic and any number of trigger events,including a failed circuit board or an out-of-sync computerclock, the excess messages clogged and shut down signaltransfer points and rapidly overwhelmed the backup systems aswell. A new version of the software -- that goes beyond thequick fixes -- is being tested and will be installed at DSCswitches, perhaps within a week.   Nevertheless, Mr. Perpiglia and others told the lawmakersthat it is too early to put the matter to rest. One questionthat remains unanswered is why the network problems didn'tshow up for several weeks after the new software wasinstalled -- and why they then cropped up in an unusualcluster at only two of the regional Bell companies. Five ofthe seven Baby Bells have installed DSC equipment in theirnetworks.   The problems started June 10 when Pacific Bell experiencedsignaling-network trouble in Los Angeles. Then, on June 26,Pacific Bell and Bell Atlantic Corp.'s Chesapeake andamp; Potomacunit experienced extended outages that shut down most localcalling in Los Angeles, Washington, Maryland, Virginia andWest Virginia. That wasn't the end of it. On July 1 and 2,Bell Atlantic's Bell of Pennsylvania experienced a majornetwork failure in western Pennsylvania. And on July 2 and 3,Pacific Bell's San Francisco-area signaling system began toshut down but was rescued by technicians who had been on thealert for network troubles.   John O'Rourke, an assistant vice president in charge ofswitching technology, analysis and reliability at BellCommunications Research Corp., told the lawmakers that a taskforce set up to investigate the outages won't be disbandedsoon. The task force, he said, is examining how each piece ofnetwork equipment and software interacts to see whether otherfactors contributed to the outages.   Bellcore, as the research consortium of the Baby Bells isknown, has established a live test bed, linking equipmentfrom DSC, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and NorthernTelecom Ltd. with Bellcore equipment in Morristown, N.J., totry to simulate events that led to the various outages.   Mr. O'Rourke said the task force still hasn't ruled outthe possibility of sabotage, but testing so far hasn't turnedup any indication of a computer virus or other tampering.Subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey stressed that the issueshouldn't be taken lightly, given the unusual coincidence ofsix network disruptions.   Mr. Perpiglia told reporters after the hearing that DSChad installed similar software patches for non-Bell telephonecompanies about nine months to a year ago. The change wasmade after the carriers experienced an unusual propagation ofmessages in their signaling computers. He declined to namethe carriers. DSC has sold switching gear and software tomany phone companies, including five of the seven Baby Bells,MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., aunit of United Telecommunications.   The Federal Communications Commission, meantime, decidedat an unusual closed session to meet with major players inthe telecommunications industry to report on the recentoutages and on steps taken to avoid future disruptions. Thecommission decided to set up a special staff with its CommonCarrier Bureau to investigate network performance matters andto set up a formal system for notifying the agency of serviceproblems.</TEXT></DOC>
