<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-1108 </DOCNO><TEXT>Westinghouse has recently installed a core on-line surveillance, monitoringand operations systems (COSMOS), which uses only currently availablecore and plant data to accurately reconstruct the core average axialand radial power distributions. This information is provided to the operatorin an immediately usable, human-engineered format and is accumulatedfor use in application programs that provide improved core performancepredictive tools and a data base for improved fuel management. Dynamicon-line real-time axial and radial core monitoring supports a varietyof plant operations to provide a favorable cost/benefit ratio for sucha system. Benefits include: (1) relaxation or elimination of certaintechnical specifications to reduce surveillance and reporting requirementsand allow higher availability factors, (2) improved information displays,predictive tools, and control strategies to support more efficient corecontrol and reduce effluent production, and (3) expanded burnup database for improved fuel management. Such systems can be backfit into operatingplants without changing the existing instrumentation and control systemand can frequently be implemented on existing plant computer capacity.</TEXT></DOC>
