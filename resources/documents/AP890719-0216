The programs have helped control the spread of AIDS by removingcontaminated needles and have drawn some addicts into treatmentcenters, the officials said.   Attorney General Ken Eikenberry's opinion was issued as U.S.Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan in Washingtonbacked away from earlier support of needle-exchange programs andtold Congress the Bush administration opposes such programs.   Eikenberry, issuing his opinion in response to a state lawmaker'srequest, said Washington state's 1988 AIDS law does not authorizeneedle exchanges and that the Legislature failed to amend a 1989anti-drug law to allow distribution of needles.   He said it was up to local prosecutors to decide whether to bringcharges against needle distributors. Prosecutors in both cities saidthey didn't plan to, at least not immediately.   ``These people are not trying to commit criminal acts,'' said TomFelnagle, chief criminal deputy prosecutor for Pierce County.   ``It's a narrow construction of the law,'' said Tacoma-PierceCounty Health Department Director Al Allen. ``We plan to continueoperating our program unless the policy of our health boardchanges.''   Tacoma's program was the first in the nation, and Pierce Countywon an award this year from the National Association of CountyHealth Officers for AIDS prevention.   The needle exchanges were begun in August 1988 by David Purchase,a former drug counselor who continues his work even though theprogram was taken over in January by the county health department.   ``We're going to keep doing what we do,'' Purchase said in aninterview. ``Our goal is to save lives. The seriousness of theproblem justifies an appropriate effort to prevent the spread ofAIDS.''   Health officials say the program has substantially reduced needlesharing by addicts. The sharing of AIDS-infected needles is a majorcause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   Counselors distributing needles in the Tacoma area have persuadedmore than 150 addicts to visit drug treatment centers since theprogram began, said Terry Reid, manager of the Tacoma-Pierce CountyAIDS program.   Reid said information indicates the exchanges do not encouragepeople to start using drugs or to use more drugs.   Jack Jourden, manager of regional services of the Seattle-KingCounty Department of Public Health, said the agency plans tocontinue the program and has asked for more money in its 1990 budget.   The city and the county would provide $65,000 to help expand theprogram beyond the single needle-exchange center in downtownSeattle. Tacoma has two such centers.   The Seattle center provides up to 10 clean needle per week peraddict, bleach for cleaning needles, safe sex information andreferrals to treatment centers. The Seattle program has been underway for about two months.   Randy Gainer, assistant city attorney for Seattle, disagreed withEikenberry's opinion and said his office told both the local healthdepartment and the city council that the program did not violatestate laws.   ``There is room to permit'' needle exchanges under current statelaw, Gainer said. He would not comment further on Eikenberry'sopinion.   Republican state Rep. Charles Wolfe of Spokane, who requestedEikenberry's opinion, said he hoped police would arrest officials inhis city if it proceeds with plans for a needle-exchange program.   ``If they hand out needles, they would be violating the law. Ibelieve in upholding the law,'' said Wolfe, a physician inoccupational medicine.   He said that exchanging needles gives the wrong message to youngpeople.   The AIDS law created a division in the state Department of Socialand Health Services to finance AIDS tracking, treatment andeducation.   The anti-drug legislation was a $70 million package of threedozen bills including tougher laws on drug dealing and education andtreatment.   The Legislature banned needle exchanges in one of the drug bills,but Gov. Gov. Booth Gardner vetoed the ban.</TEXT></DOC>
