Seven oil ministers from the 13-member Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries gathered in a hotel room to see if they couldovercome their differences.   The oil markets adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the oilproducers' regular winter conference, now in its third day. NorthSea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil,was quoted at a spot price of $18.47 a barrel in quiet dealingsMonday, up slightly from $18.44 late Friday.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of crude, wasdown slightly in early trading with the near-term contract at$19.79 a barrel, down 3 cents from Friday's close.   OPEC was at an impasse, and loosely split into two camps, overhow to meet demands from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates forbigger shares of the cartel's production pie, sources said Sunday.   ``We have not yet reached the stage of proposals. The issues areso sensitive apparently that no one dares putting forewardproposals,'' Algerian oil minister Sadek Boussena said. ``We arestill at the starting point.   The cartel's gathering formally began on Saturday, and theministers suspended talks on Sunday to reflect on their options.   OPEC members in the past have found such breaks, as well asholding small group discussions in their hotels, more productivethan gathering all the ministers at the cartel's Viennaheadquarters.   The ministers must decide whether to change their productionceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day and their target price of $18a barrel.   Oil prices have been firm, with OPEC's ``basket,'' or composite,of crude oils at $17.76 a barrel lately, even though analysts sayOPEC members are exceeding the group's output ceiling by more than2.5 million barrels a day.   Prices are more than $5 a barrel higher than a year ago becauseof strong demand for oil from Third World countries and a declinein output from non-OPEC producers. But OPEC is expecting demand tofall in the first six months of next year.   The oil market traditionally softens in the first and secondquarters as winter heating demands slacken before summer coolingand gasoline demands pick up.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been pumping aboutdouble, or 2 million barrels a day each, what they are allowedunder the last OPEC agreement, underscoring their calls for biggershares.   All the ministers appear to agree that the total ceiling couldbe raised, perhaps by as much as 2 million barrels a day, but theydisagree on how the increase should be parceled out.   A ministerial source, who demanded anonymity, on Sundaydescribed the two loose camps this way:   One camp, led by the heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iran, thinksthe increase in production should be granted to those members whocan produce more. Some members already are operating at nearcapacity.   This idea would allow Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates topump more, and would leave unchanged the shares for Saudi Arabia,Iran and Iraq. The rest of the members would reduce their shares ofa larger pie.   But this idea is onerous to poorer members that are moredependent on their oil revenues, the ministerial source said.   The second camp believes all the members should give up part oftheir share to allow Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates largerslices, the ministerial source said.   But Saudi Arabia has insisted it won't accept less than itsallotment of one-quarter of the total production limit. It recentlyincreased its production above its quota, a move analysts say isdesigned to emphasize that point.   The fallback position would be to increase production equallyamong all members, the ministerial source said.   But this wouldn't address Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates'demands for bigger shares, nor solve the problem of cheating onquotas, which undermines OPEC's aims.   Algeria's Boussena said an option being considered is anagreement that would not be signed by all 13 OPEC members.   Boussena added, ``We must have an agreement of 13. That is mypoint of view.''   OPEC could simply roll over its existing accord, as it has donein the past, but the oil markets likely would view such a move as asign of weakness.   Failure to reach an agreement could bring oil prices to as lowas $12 a barrel by the spring, the anonymous ministerial sourcesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
