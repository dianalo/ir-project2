Such drugs are proteins that can't be taken in pill form because they would be digested in the gut and never reach the bloodstream. Instead, they must be injected, a big inconvenience if a drug must be taken regularly for a lifetime.    The experiment at the federal National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute involved a dozen patients suffering a hereditary lung disease in which lack of a protein called alpha one-antitrypsin leads to destruction of the lung's tiny air sacs and early emphysema.    The lung destruction can be prevented by weekly, half-hourlong infusions of alpha one-antitrypsin directly into the bloodstream. So little of the protein reaches the lung, however, it requires about $30,000 worth of antitrypsin to treat a patient for a year. The protein is extracted from donated blood, although a genetically engineered version is under development.    The researchers made an experimental aerosol containing the protein and asked patients to inhale it every 12 hours for a week. As hoped, a large portion of each dose penetrated deep into the lungs, the researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine. This showed inhalation is feasible and safe, but longer studies are needed to see if it's effective in the lung disorder.    The researchers also found that the inhaled protein passed through the air sacs into the bloodstream, suggesting a new, easy way to get protein drugs into the blood, says Ronald G. Crystal, one of the researchers.    Among proteins that might be inhaled someday are human growth hormone for short stature in children, erythropoietin (EPO) for anemias, interferon for several diseases and clotting factors for hemophilia. &quot;Insulin {for diabetics} also is a possibility&quot; if the dosage can be carefully controlled, Dr. Crystal says.    College Engineers Put    Air Conditioning on Ice    THE ICEMAN returneth, but only to cool the office. Engineers at the University of Missouri in Kansas City are developing a more efficient way of using ice to cool office buildings.    In large air-conditioning systems, air is cooled by being blown over coils containing refrigerated water. To cut the cost of refrigerating the water, many buildings, particularly in Texas and California, are resorting to &quot;thermal storage&quot; in which the system makes large amounts of ice at night when electric rates are low. The next day, the ice is used to cool the circulating water, avoiding the use of refrigeration when electric rates are high.    But there's a problem. To make the ice, thin sheets of water flow over arrays of vertical plates that are cooled to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately, the ice sticks to the plates; after a quarter inch or so of ice is formed, the plates have to be warmed so the slush falls off.    This alternate cooling and warming of the plates consumes 10% to 20% of the energy used in the ice-making process, says William Stewart, mechanical and aerospace engineering professor.    After three years of research funded by the Electric Power Research Institute, the Missouri engineers have developed a still-secret water additive that prevents the ice from sticking to the plates, eliminating the warming cycle.    &quot;We're still in the laboratory trying to get some definitive efficiency numbers,&quot; Prof. Stewart says, but a pilot project might be tried in the next several months.    Chemical Process Gives    Books Longer Shelf Life    TECHNIQUE to preserve books passes its acid test.    For years, librarians have anguished over the fact that for a century, after paper makers switched to wood pulp from rags, book paper has been highly acidic and disintegrates in about 50 years, compared with hundreds of years for rag paper. Three million volumes in the Library of Congress are now too fragile to circulate, and 16 million volumes may become so in the future.    Library of Congress researchers found that exposing books to a gas of diethyl zinc (DEZ) in a low-pressure chamber would neutralize the acid and lengthen the paper's life. But a pilot project at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ended in a major fire in 1985.    Now, a chemical company, Texas Alkyls, reports it has successfully finished an 18-month-long demonstration of the DEZ treatment at a pilot plant in Deer Park, Texas. The company is a joint venture of Akzo Chemicals Inc., a Dutch-owned company, and Hercules Inc. The books could be treated for $6 to $10 each, compared with $70 to microfilm the average book.    Akzo says its licensing agreement with the Library of Congress calls for Texas Alkyls to build in the next 42 months two full-scale facilities, each capable of treating a million volumes a year.    Odds and Ends    ADULTS correctly squeezed out about one gram of skin ointment from a tube when told to apply two to 2 1/2 &quot;index fingertips&quot; of cream, report Welsh dermatologists looking for a way to prescribe ointment dosages other than saying &quot;three centimeters.&quot; . . . Tomatoes, potatoes and cauliflower at roadside stands have more vitamin C than the same vegetables in grocery stores, but grocery-store cabbage rates higher in the vitamin than roadside cabbage, University of Maine researchers find. Place of purchase makes little difference vitamin-wise for broccoli, cantaloupe, green pepper and spinach. </TEXT></DOC>
