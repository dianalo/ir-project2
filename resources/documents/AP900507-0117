Several apartment buildings and filling stations in the310-square-mile Christian enclave were set ablaze. Trucks carryingfood across Beirut's dividing Green Line also were burning, policeand witnesses said.   ``Everything is burning at the crossing. Drivers abandoned theirtrucks and ran back to the Moslem sector. So did hundreds ofChristian residents,'' said Simon Khoury, a Christian electricianwho made it back to west Beirut.   The fighting marked a sharp escalation in the 3{-month-oldbattle between army Gen. Michel Aoun and Christian warlord SamirGeagea for mastery of the enclave north and northeast of Beirut.   Police said the fatalities included a family of five killed whena shell struck the basement of their building in theAoun-controlled town of Fanar north of Beirut.   Also killed was police Capt. Pierre Ghawi. He died when severalartillery rounds strayed from the embattled enclave and landed inthe Moslem sector. Four civilians were wounded in west Beirut,police said.   Flames lit up the night sky and the roar of shell blastsreverberated across Beirut. Tens of thousands of residents huddledin basements and bomb shelters on both sides of the Green Line.   Christian employees of Middle East Airlines and the TransMediterranean Airlines, Lebanon's national passenger and cargocarriers, were trapped at Beirut airport, unable to return home.   Employees will spend the night at the facility, on the southernedge of Beirut, an airport statement said.   Aoun's mountain-top positions poured 155mm howitzer barrages oneast Beirut's seaside Karantina district, which houses the militarycommand of Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.   A Lebanese Forces gunboat off Karantina was seen unleashingrapid barrages of rockets from multi-barreled launchers on the Metnmountains and then speeding away with shells falling all around.   Each side blamed the other for the flare-up, which broke out atmidnight Sunday, tapered off four hours later and escalated againin the afternoon.   The fighting between Aoun's 19,000 troops and Geagea's 6,000militiamen has left 934 people dead and 2,483 wounded, by thelatest police count.   The conflict, the worst inter-christian confrontation in thenation's 15-year-old civil war, has forced more than 400,000 of theenclave's 1 million inhabitants to flee. Material damage has beenestimated at $1 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
