Three months after signing major taxes into law as part oflast year's deficit-cutting package, Mr. Bush returned in hisbudget to his &quot;no new taxes&quot; campaign stance. Despite recorddeficits, most of his tax proposals would cost money throughbreaks to individuals and businesses -- for a net cost to theTreasury of $11.8 billion over five years, according to asenior Treasury official. That doesn't include the proposalto cut the capital-gains tax, which the administration countsas a revenueraiser while congressional Democrats consider ita loser.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The underlying theme, except for the reintroduction ofcapital gains, is to leave the tax system as it is,&quot; saidTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.   Though Mr. Bush renewed his bid for the capital-gains taxcut, which Democrats have effectively derided as a boon tothe rich, his budget does so in a way that feeds speculationthat he is no longer serious about it. The phrase &quot;capitalgains,&quot; which was found on page three of last year's budget,first appears about 440 pages into the latest volume.   But just as the president's call for the tax cut is muted,so, too, is the Democrats' response. Last year's campaign for&quot;tax fairness,&quot; featuring such ideas as a surtax onmillionaires, is at least for now a casualty of the Gulf war,given voters' &quot;rally-round-the-president&quot; mood. It's &quot;lostbeneath the drums of war,&quot; says a top Democratic aide.   But if the president presses for the capital-gains taxcut, &quot;it would almost certainly invite other kinds of taxchanges,&quot; said House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.). Rep.Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.) of the tax-writing House Ways andMeans Committee, said &quot;that could retrigger the wholefairness question again.&quot;   The proposal on capital gains, which are profits from thesales of assets, such as property, is identical to Mr. Bush'srequest last year. To encourage longer-term investments, thetax break would be greater the longer an asset was held.Taxpayers could exclude from taxable income 30% of the profiton assets held at least three years, for an effective rate of19.6% for the wealthiest Americans. Assets held two yearswould qualify for a 20% exclusion, or a 22.4% top rate, andthose held a year would get a 10% exclusion, or a 25.2% rate.The top rate on capital gains now is 28%.   The administration estimates the tax cut would raise $9.1billion over five years, as investors rushed to sell assetsto gain the lower taxes. Last year, the nonpartisan Joint TaxCommittee of Congress projected a net cost exceeding $11billion.   Under the president's budget, the major source for new taxrevenues would be state and local government employees whodon't pay for Medicare coverage. The payroll taxes on themwould raise $7.3 billion over five years. Congress hasrejected the proposal before, though a precedent was set lastyear when payroll taxes for Social Security were extended toall such governmental workers.   The president once again proposed a Family SavingsAccount, which would allow most families to deposit as muchas $5,000 a year in a financial institution and earn tax-freeinterest if the accounts weren't tapped for at least sevenyears. The idea, intended to boost the nation's savings pool,would cost the government $6.5 billion over five years.   Mr. Bush also proposed to permit first-time homebuyers tomake early withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accountswithout any penalty, at a cost of $440 million over fiveyears. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the SenateFinance Committee, is promoting a more generous proposal thathe calls &quot;Super-IRA.&quot; Among other things, his proposal wouldrestore the deductibility of IRAs for upper-income taxpayersand allow early withdrawals for education and major medicalexpenses as well as home-buying.   Other revenue-losing proposals are designed to spurbusiness, though Mr. Bush offered no new ones to combat therecession. He wants a permanent extension of aresearch-and-development tax credit, typically renewedannually, at a cost of $6.2 billion over five years. Taxincentives for the development of &quot;enterprise zones&quot; indepressed neighborhoods would cost $1.8 billion over fiveyears. Mr. Bush's budget would extend a tax credit for ownersof low-income housing. For the first time, it espousesextension of the existing breaks for investments in solar andgeothermal energy and for employers who hire disadvantagedjob-seekers.   Total government revenues for fiscal 1992, which beginsOct. 1, will be $1.165 trillion -- a 6.7% increase fromfiscal 1991, according to the administration, but stillroughly $300 billion below spending.</TEXT></DOC>
