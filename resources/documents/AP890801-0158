(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People exposed to asbestos or other toxicsubstances can't collect damages just because they may have anincreased risk of cancer, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.   The court ruled that people could collect damages only if theydevelop cancer or can prove through expert testimony that they havea better than 50 percent chance of getting the disease.   ``This is a decision that will have major national repercussionsfor asbestos and other toxic substance cases,'' said attorney GitaF. Rothschild, who represented the three companies involved in thelawsuit.   ``There are 80,000 cases like this pending in state and federalcourts,'' said Ms. Rothschild. ``In every single case involvingtoxic substances, the plaintiffs allege the possibility ofcontracting cancer.''   Ms. Rothschild said the decision allows companies ``to paydamages for people who actually get sick.''   The court relied heavily on a lower court ruling that allowsworkers and others who are exposed to toxic materials to collectdamages after they have contracted cancer, regardless of how longafter exposure that occurs.   It also upheld a ruling that ``In New Jersey, damages may not beawarded for any future injury which is merely possible but notprobable.''   In a 5-1 decision, the Supreme Court said Roger Mauro and hiswife, Lois, cannot collect damages for his fear that he maycontract cancer after being exposed to asbestos fibers whileworking as a plumber-steamfitter for more than a decade at AncoraState Psychiatric Hospital in Hammonton.   Mauro, who said the exposure occurred when he ripped out oldinsulation, found in 1981 that he had thickening of his chest wallsand calcification of his diaphragm. His doctor wrote that Mauro's``exposure to asbestos has been significant and there is someevidence that this exposure may have increased (the) risk ofdeveloping lung cancer.''   Mauro sued product manufacturers Owens-Corning Fiberglass ofToledo, Ohio; Pittsburgh-Corning Corp. of Pittsburgh; Keen Corp. ofNew York; and Eagle-Picher Industries of Cincinnati, claiming thecompanies failed to warn him of the risk.   The court said that although there is a high probability thatMauro has an increased risk of cancer, ``there is no evidence ...of the likelihood that the plaintiff will contract cancer.''   Mauro's attorney, Gene Locks, did not return telephone calls onTuesday. The opinion did not list Mauro's hometown.</TEXT></DOC>
