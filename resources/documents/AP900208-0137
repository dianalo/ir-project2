The names of those arrested have not been released, but Bruckersaid that besides the corporate attorney, one is the vice presidentof an insurance company and several are thought to be earningsix-figure salaries.   Brucker said he couldn't give out the names of those arrestedbecause disclosure could hamper the continuing investigation.   The railroad links New York City to its northern suburbs in NewYork state and Connecticut, including some of the most expensivetowns in the region. Brucker said the average monthly ticket costs$120, and the counterfeits generally sold for half of face value.   Usually, riders with passes simply flash the tickets at theconductor as he walks through the train. But on occasion, ticketsare checked more closely.   Brucker said that on one such day in December, ``A corporateattorney had made himself a counterfeit and he was so nervous andjittery when presenting the ticket the conductor becamesuspicious.''   The conductor notified police and the attorney was arrested whenthe train reached Grand Central Terminal.   Since then, 11 others have been caught using phony monthly andweekly tickets. Metro-North police Chief Gerald Hotopp said chargesrange from the misdemeanors theft of services and larceny, toforgery and criminal possession of a forged instrument, feloniesthat carry prison terms of up to 15 years.   In all but one case, the commuter spent the night in jail.</TEXT></DOC>
