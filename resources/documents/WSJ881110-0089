Ricks and Craig Forman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC </G><TEXT>   British authorities appear close to a decision to bring charges against Robert Harris, the senior partner of Seligmann, Harris andamp; Co., in connection with trades executed by that London-based brokerage firm for Ivan Boesky, people in the U.S. familiar with the matter said.    Earlier this week, British investigators briefed Securities and Exchange Commission officials about new findings in their inquiry into an alleged scheme to support the price of Guinness PLC's shares during its $4.3 billion takeover of Distillers Co. in 1986. The investigators also sought additional information from Mr. Boesky in the matter.    In London, Mr. Harris declined to discuss the matter over the telephone but said he was too busy to meet in person yesterday. He said indications of possible charges were &quot;brand new to me.&quot; He said he had had no recent contact with British law-enforcement authorities. Asked a series of questions about the Guinness affair and related matters, Mr. Harris said, &quot;I'm obviously intrigued&quot; by them, but declined to elaborate.    The SEC also seems to be moving closer to bringing stock &quot;parking&quot; charges against Mr. Harris separate from the Guinness matter. Settlement talks between the agency and Mr. Harris's attorneys in the bookkeeping and record-keeping case broke down earlier this year, other people familiar with the investigation said. But the matter also is being probed by a grand jury in New York, these people said, and the SEC may wait for that panel to act before filing a complaint. Attorneys for Mr. Harris in the U.S. declined to comment.    John Wood, director the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office, which is spearheading the investigation of the Guinness affair, confirmed that British police officers are in the U.S. But he declined to say whether any action against Mr. Harris or his firm is contemplated, saying that &quot;isn't the sort of thing we talk about&quot; prior to formal action. He also declined to say whether British authorities have decided to pursue any specific course of action.    British investigators appear to have developed information in the Guinness matter that goes far beyond that provided two years ago by Mr. Boesky after he settled his insider-trading case with the SEC. Once one of the most powerful figures on Wall Street, Mr. Boesky stunned the financial world in November 1986 with the announcement that he had agreed to plead guilty to one felony charge and had settled SEC charges by paying a record $100 million in penalties.    Mr. Wood declined to discuss the evidence now in hand, but a senior British regulatory official said U.K. investigators have maintained close contact with their counterparts in the U.S. &quot;If we do turn things up, it goes back to the SEC. The investigations run in parallel,&quot; the regulator said. &quot;Once into the game, it may well be someone turns up something that hasn't been whole truth.&quot; Until that information is cross-checked with the SEC, he added, it isn't possible to know whether it is new.    Seligmann Harris was among several brokerage firms named in SEC subpoenas issued about a year ago in relation to a wide-ranging investigation of stock parking. Parking occurs when one investor buys securities for another who wants to conceal the true ownership of the securities. Such arrangements may be used to enable buyers to accumulate large positions in the stocks of companies without complying with federal disclosure or capital requirements.    Seligmann Harris was mentioned but not charged in a complaint against Mr. Boesky's former head trader, Michael Davidoff, who pleaded guilty last year to one felony charge for engaging in a parking scheme with the London firm. The government alleged in its indictment that there was &quot;a secret agreement&quot; between Mr. Davidoff and Seligmann Harris to disguise what the government called &quot;bogus trades.&quot;    Mr. Davidoff has continued to cooperate with the SEC, his attorney, Paul Rooney, said yesterday.    SEC attorneys declined to comment about their meetings with the British investigators or about their own investigations. </TEXT></DOC>
