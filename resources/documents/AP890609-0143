Supporters said the action will promotepeace and constitutional reform.   ``Only in police and totalitarian states does the governmentassume such frightening powers when it is not at war,'' saidAnglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu. ``The state of emergency is veryconvenient for an authoritarian government that has no legitimacyamongst the majority of the people.''   In Washington, 57 senators and the State Department expressed``disappointment'' at the extension of emergency powers.   ``A peaceful end to apartheid will only be possible if politicaland human rights are respected in South Africa,'' said a telegram by38 Democrats and 19 Republicans to President P.W. Botha.   Botha extended the 3-year-old emergency at midnight withoutmaking any changes in the restrictions on freedom of the press,speech and assembly, or reducing the power of police to take anyaction they deem necessary to maintain law and order.   Botha said that although political violence has declined,revolutionaries were ``continuing underground to mobilize and toexert their influence.'' He said emergency rule permits his NationalParty government to proceed with upgrading black living conditionsand seeking negotiations with black leaders on changes in theapartheid system.   But Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, one of those the governmentis trying to coax into negotiations, called the extension ``a tragicindication of the abnormality of our society.   ``Real negotiation between white and black leaders will not getoff the ground while political leaders remain in jail and others areunder a constant threat of detention,'' he said.   Approximately 30,000 people, mostly black, were detained withouttrial during the emergency. Hundreds were freed this year after ahunger strike among detainees, but officials say restrictions wereimposed on about 500 of them.   The restrictions include house arrest, bans on speaking inpublic, writing articles for publication, attending politicalmeetings or criticizing the government.   F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party and Botha'sdesignated successor after September parliamentary elections,expressed his full support for the decision to extend the emergencyfor another year. He said a certain degree of stability had beenachieved through the decrease in violence and the advancement ofsocial and economic development in black townships.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
