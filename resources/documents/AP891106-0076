(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican Lynn Martin, a five-termcongresswoman and close ally of President Bush, today launched herbid to unseat one of the nation's best-known Democratic senators,Paul Simon.   Martin, 49, formally began her campaign for the U.S. Senate morethan four months after she announced her decision to take on Simonin next year's election.   ``Illinois deserves better'' is the theme of her campaign,Martin said in an early morning speech at Greater Rockford Airportin the northern Illinois district she represents in Congress. Herdeparture began a six-city fly-around stint through Illinois.   ``Illinois deserves better than a part-time senator who seesAmerica through a rear-view mirror and wants to go back to the1930s,'' said Martin.   During his first Senate term, Simon crisscrossed the country ina failed bid for the 1988 Democratic nomination for president.   The lawmaker said June 21 that she would challenge Simon, whoupset incumbent GOP Sen. Charles Percy in 1984. She's sincecontinued to jab at Simon on a number of issues, including defensespending and federal funding.   GOP strategists have made Simon a top target for defeat in nextyear's Senate campaign, a decision that will bring extra money andcampaign assistance for Martin.   President Bush, who encouraged Martin to enter the Senate race,is scheduled to stump for her Nov. 20 in Chicago, and has promisedto return to Illinois during next year's campaign.   Martin seconded Bush's nomination at the 1988 RepublicanNational Convention and served as national co-chairman of hispresidential campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
