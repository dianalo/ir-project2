Monday brings former Rep. Pat Swindall's long-awaited day incourt, barring a last-minute delay.   The defense has sought to move the trial out of Atlanta becauseof publicity, but U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman has deferredany ruling on that request until he tries to seat an impartial juryin Atlanta.   The trial is crucial to the 38-year-old evangelicalconservative's political future. The two-term Republican hasmaintained a political organization, and says he would like to runagainst U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., in 1992 _ if he is acquitted.   Swindall was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts, each of whichcarries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison.   The indictment accuses Swindall of lying under oath in early1988 to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with anassociate, later convicted of money laundering, and with a federalundercover agent posing as a money broker for probable drug dealers.   Swindall, running for re-election, waived his right to filepre-trial motions last October and asked that the case be triedimmediately, with the congressman acting as his own attorney.Prosecutors agreed, and the trial began two weeks before ElectionDay.   But U.S. District Judge Robert Vining stopped the trial afterSwindall campaign mailings, proclaiming his innocence, arrived atthe homes of at least two jurors. Thirteen days later, on Nov. 8,Swindall lost his 4th District seat, in Atlanta's eastern suburbs,to Democrat Ben Jones, after a campaign marked by mud-slinging onboth sides.   In the indictment, Swindall is accused of lying about hismeetings with two men: Charles LeChasney, an associate and admittedmoney launderer, and ``Mike Martinez,'' actually Mike Mullaney, afederal agent posing as a money broker.   Tapes of the encounters, leaked to the news media last year,show Swindall, who was seeking an $850,000 loan to help pay for hisluxurious Stone Mountain home, being told by ``Martinez'' that themoney probably was connected with drugs and might pose problems forthe congressman.   Swindall told the agent that if the money came to him throughLeChasney's company, ``it becomes Charles' problem.''   The indictment contends that Swindall lied in concealing fromthe grand jury his discussions on how the tracks of the money wouldbe covered to protect him.   Swindall also told the grand jury that he ``never chose toborrow the money,'' although he acknowledged receiving a $150,000check from LeChasney.   Swindall, who conducted an animated defense in court last fall,has been represented in pre-trial motions this time by attorneyRichard Hendrix, a former federal prosecutor.   The former congressman has kept a low profile in the weekspreceding the trial. He did host a party for some 200 supporters athis home _ which is up for sale _ earlier this month. Standing onhis diving board, he urged them to ``pray that justice will beserved.''</TEXT></DOC>
