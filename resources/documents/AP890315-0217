The opposition's chief spokesman, Patricio Aylwin, the first suchleader invited to the government palace under the 15-year-oldmilitary government, called his 30-minute talk with Caceres``positive.''   Caceres said some proposals submitted by Aylwin for democraticchanges to the constitution were ``interesting.''   Aylwin is president of the centrist Christian Democratic Partyand spokesman for a 17-party opposition coalition. He is considereda front-runner to the nomination as the opposition's singlepresidential candidate in the election scheduled for Dec. 14.   The meeting was part of a series of talks opened Tuesday by thegovernment with pro-government and opposition politicians to seek anagreement on changes to the 1980 military-written constitution.   The day before, Caceres met with Sergio Jarpa, president of theright-wing National Vanguard party. He is scheduled to meet anotherright-wing leader Thursday.   President Gen. Augusto Pinochet announced Saturday in his annualstate-of-the-nation message that he is willing to consider some keydemocratic changes sought by dissidents. It was the first time the73-year-old president and army commander accepted such a possibility.   Pinochet made clear that his idea is ``to perfect'' theconstitution, ``not to dismantle it.'' He said he would studyproposals to amend an article banning Marxism, to shorten thepresent eight-year presidential term and to eliminate thepresident's emergency power to exile citizens.   The president also said the changes may include adding onemember, probably a civilian, to a powerful military-dominatedNational Security Council, and to ease the requirements for futureconstitutional changes.   Any constitutional changes would have to be approved in anational referendum, which government sources say could take placenext June.   Aylwin suggested Caceres set up a commission of government andopposition constitutional experts to come up with a joint proposalfor the changes. He did not disclose the minister's reaction to hisproposal.   It was the first high-level contact between the Pinochetgovernment and the opposition since an aborted dialogue five yearsago, when the government was shaken by a series of street proteststhat left scores dead.   Pinochet took power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled theelected government of Salvador Allende, a Marxist. Allende died inthe takeover.</TEXT></DOC>
