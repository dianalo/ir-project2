Data were recorded in each of nine dogs under three conditions:1) during a baseline control interval, 2) during renal artery stenosis,and 3) during stenosis with intravenous injection of captopril (1.2 mg/kg).Mean arterial blood pressure was 108 +/- 12 mm Hg at control, increasedsignificantly to 125 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) during stenosis,and decreased to 98 +/- 13 mm/Hg (p less than 0.01) after captopril infusion.Mean renal blood flow was calculated using a steady state single compartmentmodel from the images produced by positron emission tomography. The estimatedflow to the affected kidney was 3.37 +/- 1.48 ml/min/g at control, 0.86+/- 0.62 ml/min/g during stenosis (p less than 0.01), and 0.64 +/- 0.57ml/min/g after captopril administration (p = NS compared with precaptoprilvalue). The estimated flow to the contralateral kidney was minimallyreduced from a baseline of 3.84 +/- 0.95 to 3.24 +/- 1.13 ml/min/g (p= NS) during stenosis and increased after captopril infusion (4.08 +/-0.94 ml/min/g; p = 0.01). These data suggest that repetitive imagingwith positron emission tomography can be used to delineate acute changesin renal perfusion following captopril administration.</TEXT></DOC>
