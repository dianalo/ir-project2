He also hinted that the Palestine Liberation Organization wouldreconsider its policies if what he called ``Israeli crimes''continue, but said the organization stands by its peace proposals.   Asked at a news conference about increasing Arab attacks onpurported collaborators in the Israeli-occupied territories Arafatresponded: ``Are you against it? Are you against it?''   ``They are quislings, those who are coordinating with ourenemies.''   ``How many quislings were killed in Europe during the Nazioccupation? And even after the withdrawal, you remember whathappened in Paris?'' he asked, referring to attacks on French peoplewho collaborated with German forces during World War II.   But he said Arabs collaborating with Israel should be given achance to repent and should be singled out for punishment only bythe Palestinian leadership, not individuals.   Arabs have slain 97 Palestinians accused as collaborators duringthe 20 months of the uprising against Israeli occupation. Israelitroops and settlers have killed at least 545 Palestinians during theuprising and 38 Israelis have perished.   The underground leadership of the uprising this month accusedIsrael of trying to divide Palestinians by inspiring leaflets thatfalsely accused Arab patriots of being collaborators. Among thoseaccused was PLO Executive Committee member Mohammed Milhem, who satnear Arafat on Tuesday and helped translate his remarks.   Arafat arrived in Amman Sunday and held talks with King Husseinand senior aides. He left for an undisclosed destination after thenews conference.</TEXT></DOC>
