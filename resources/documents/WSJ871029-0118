With property and casualty rates starting to fall, New York state sets up a hot line for broker complaints about rate undercutting. The concern: &quot;We don't want companies to write business they can't afford to insure,&quot; fueling future rate increases, says Kevin Foley, deputy insurance superintendent. Other states, including Connecticut, also eye rates closely, having set up guidelines to keep them from rising or falling too much.    But the stock-market plunge may slow the trend toward lower rates. The market drop has stripped about $10 billion from insurers' capital, leaving fewer dollars to back new business, says data-gatherer Insurance Services Office Inc. &quot;The stock market slide may temper the downslide the insurance market is currently going through,&quot; says Horace Holcomb of insurance-broker Alexander andamp; Alexander Inc.    Regulators' concerns are &quot;premature&quot; with rates remaining too high, says Jon Harkavy of Risk and Insurance Management Society.    KIDS CLAIM more attention in the Halloween market.    The baby boomlet and the growing number of working moms means a shift in Halloween business. &quot;Used to be parents wanted something cheap or they'd make something,&quot; says I.H. Dawson of Cleveland Costume andamp; Display Co. in Ohio. &quot;Not any more. They don't have the time or know-how.&quot; Rentals and sales to children are up 30% there. The costume market gets younger. Costume-maker National Theme Productions, San Diego, launches toddler outfits, including a duck and a dinosaur.    Price is no object. A kid's gangster getup sells for $125 at Cleveland Costume. TV-character Alf costumes at $40 and up are selling out across the country, as are the $35 masks of ghoulish Freddy Krueger from the movie &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street.&quot; Requests for parties, starting at $140, are up 20% this year at Kiddie Antics, Sherman Oaks, Calif. But Halloween stays largely an adult holiday, says Jean Benton of Costumes Inc., Pittsburgh. She's been invited to six parties; her kids, none.    SUPERCONDUCTORS find their way into the classroom quickly.    Unlike most new technologies, materials that conduct electricity without resistance are being used in high-school classrooms only months after their discovery, says Madison, Wis., teacher David Braunschweig. University of Wisconsin chemist Arthur Ellis develops a $25 levitation kit for the Institute for Chemical Education that includes a superconductor, magnets and directions for making superconductors. John Hopkins Magazine and New Scientist magazine publish recipes for superconductors that can be made with ceramic kilns and hydraulic presses.    Education &quot;is the first real application of the discovery, and it is happening very quickly,&quot; says International Business Machines Corp. research scientist Paul Grant. Says Glen Direen of the Institute for Chemical Education, &quot;Some one of those students in one of those classrooms may devise applications&quot; for superconductors.    Demand is strong. A $20 superconductor disk sold by Edmund Scientific Co., Barrington, N.J., is back-ordered four to six weeks.    WALL STREET JITTERS generate a rash of ills. Larry Lerner, a lower Manhattan internist, saw his practice double last week with complaints of headaches, backaches and heart palpitations. Downtown dermatologist Alan Greenspan sees more stress-caused herpes outbreaks; he expects more cases of temporary hair loss.    CONSUMING PASSION: About half of Americans surveyed by Neiman-Marcus and American Express Co. say they like shopping as much as or more than watching TV. Some 46% rate shopping the same as or better than going to the movies; 17% say it's at least as good as romance.    MARKET TURMOIL triggered a stampede for Canada Savings Bonds, the government-guaranteed bonds sold once a year. Demand is so strong that the government will end its sale Friday, after only five days. Normally it lasts several weeks. The 10-year bonds, with a 9% first-year interest rate, can be held only by Canadian residents.    DETAILING ZOOMS as more car owners go for customized cleaning.    The $200 million annual market could grow to $2.5 billion in the 1990s, says a study by consultant McKinsey andamp; Co. Autophiles are spending up to $165 to have their high-priced cars bathed and buffed by hand. &quot;Younger people don't want to use their disposable time to care for their cars,&quot; says Frank Bianco of Auto Wax Center of Westchester, New Rochelle, N.Y.    Small operators dominate the 7,000-shop industry, which is big in Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles and Atlanta. But franchising is taking hold. With 32 shops now, Steve's Detailing Management Corp., Costa Mesa, Calif., projects a total of 250 by 1990. USA Auto Appearance Centers of Lakewood, Colo., is opening shops in some Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. automotive stores, allowing Ward's customers to charge the $99.95 job.    Shops come and go. Half of those in Denver's 1987 Yellow Pages aren't in business anymore, McKinsey says.    BRIEFS: New England Journal of Medicine quits taking financial services ads, calling them &quot;not appropriate.&quot; . . . To commemorate the 1929 stock-market crash, a person dressed as a can of Maalox Whip will hand out samples of the antacid at the New York Stock Exchange today. </TEXT></DOC>
