ROTSTEIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities Tuesday arrested at least 17people accused of being part of a 16-state cocaine and marijuanaring, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official said.   ``We feel confident we have pretty much immobilized an entireorganization,'' said Gerard Murphy, the top DEA agent in Arizona.   Another two of the 40 people indicted in the case were inMexican jails, Murphy said. Twenty-one remained at large.   Law enforcement officers also seized $1 million in cash, carsand other assets, he said.   Since 1984, the southern Arizona-based ring has distributed1,000 kilograms of cocaine, 305 tons of marijuana and 1 millionmethaqualone tablets around the country, Murphy said. He could notestimate the value of the drugs.   The ring was headed by Michael Hooks, who has been in a MexicoCity prison on Mexican charges since June 1987, the agent alleged.Murphy declined to release any other information about Hooks.   Authorities arrested seven people in Tucson and one each in SanFrancisco, Mobile and Birmingham, Ala.; Nashville, Tenn., and GrandRapids, Mich., Murphy said. Three other suspects were already inprisons in California and another was in Douglas, Ariz.   Mexican officials have been asked to transfer Hooks to Americancustody, he said.   Suspects were also being sought in Florida, Illinois, Oklahoma,Texas, and Arkansas, Murphy said. The ring also operated inMinnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and NorthCarolina.   The DEA began its investigation after a plane crashed in 1985near San Manuel, about 40 miles northeast of Tucson, Murphy said.The U.S. Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service and theArizona Department of Public Safety also took part in the probe.   A 1986 raid in Tucson turned up 16 kilograms of cocaine anddetailed drug ledgers containing ``staggering'' numbers, he said.   The investigation earlier led to the indictment of Mexicanmarijuana trafficker Rafael Caro-Quintero on charges he operated acontinuing criminal enterprise, Murphy said.   Caro-Quintero, serving a sentence in Mexico City for his role inthe kidnapping and torture murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena,has been identified as one of the Hooks' organization's mainsuppliers of marijuana, Murphy added.   The cocaine source has been narrowed to Medillin, Colombia, hesaid.   The ring flew and dropped off all but two drug loads atclandestine Arizona airstrips for storage and subsequentdistribution, he said.   Murphy said the charges in the indictment returned June 28 by afederal grand jury in Tucson involved actions in 1985 and 1986.   The indictments were the fourth set the grand jury has issuedconcerning the Hooks organization since June 1986, he said. In all,the grand jury has named 96 defendants and panels in Minnesota andAlabama have named another 14.   Twenty-five of the 70 indicted previously remain fugitives, andall but one of the remaining 45 have been convicted.</TEXT></DOC>
