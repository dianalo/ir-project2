(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Rifle Association istrying to get this city's interim police chief ousted, saying heunfairly charged a service station owner with illegal possession ofa handgun after a robbery.   In a letter mailed to NRA members here Friday, one of theorganization's national directors asks for help in keeping KeithBergstrom ``from bringing his campaign against law-abiding gunowners to Tarpon Springs.''   The letter told members they should to voice their oppositionTuesday when city commissioners meet to consider permanentlyappointing Bergstrom as chief.   In question is Bergstrom's enforcement of an anti-gun ordinancewhile he was police chief in Oak Park, Ill. An April 1984 measurebanned possession of a handgun within the city limits.   ``I find it very ironic that the NRA in effect is criticizing mefor obeying the law and being accountable to the people who makethe law,'' Bergstrom said Friday.   Oak Park police charged service station owner Don Bennett withviolating the ordinance when, following a robbery at his station in1986, he chased the suspects and fired at them with a .45-caliberpistol, Bergstrom said.   Bennett ultimately was acquitted.   ``The police department and their attorneys spent all of theirefforts in prosecuting Don Bennett and there was never an attemptto find the robbers,'' said Theodore A. Lattanzio, theWashington-based NRA official who wrote the letter. ``They weretrying to prosecute a man who tried to use a weapon inself-defense.''   Bergstrom, who came to Tarpon Springs in October 1987, deniedthe NRA accusations.   Bennett has filed a federal lawsuit naming Bergstrom, two OakPark police officers and another city official and seeking morethan $2 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitivedamages from each defendant.   The lawsuit alleges the defendants were part of a conspiracy toprevent him from doing business, Bennett said Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
