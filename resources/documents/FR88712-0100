The revision reflects changes based on the experience SBA has gatheredin administering the secondary market since the President signed into lawthe Small Business Secondary Market Improvements Act in 1984 (Pub. L. 98-352;98 Stat. 329). It incorporates several changes that have been suggestedby lenders, investors and broker/dealers.On March 9, 1988 (53 FR 7618), the public was asked to provide commentson the proposed revision. Over 130 comments were received. These have beenanalyzed and SBA has made certain changes to the revision that had beenproposed.The major resulting changes to Form 1086 are these:1. A servicing fee of no less than 1.0 percent per annum will be requiredon any Guaranteed Interest sold at a price greater than par (paragraph6(e)). SBA had originally proposed a servicing fee of no less than 2.0%.This recommendation was based upon the observation that while Federal ReserveBoard data show the average operating expense of banks to be about twopercent of ``Commercial and Other'' loan volume, almost 30 percent of theloans entering the secondary market in FY 1987 carried a servicing feeof 0.5 percent or less.The comments focussed on the proposal. While most commenters supporteda required minimum servicing fee, they unanimously argued that the costof servicing an SBA loan was less than 2.0%. Some commenters submitteddata on their own servicing costs as a percent of loan volume. Some pointedout that the Federal Reserve Board data covered all operating expenses,not only servicing costs.SBA has reduced the minimum servicing fee from 2.0% to 1.0% per annum.This action is based upon the cost data submitted, other information putforward in the comments, and SBA's need to find an alternative Lender toservice the loan if the original Lender fails. This provision will applyto loans sold at a price greater than par.SBA has also clarified that the minimum servicing fee of 1.0% shall betransferable only to an entity to which servicing is transferred underthe provisions of SBA Form 750 (Loan Guaranty Agreement), SBA Regulationsand SBA's Standard Operating Procedures. This limitation comports withthe statutory mandate for SBA to develop procedures as necessary to facilitate,administer and promote secondary market operations. [See Title 15, UnitedStates Code, Section 634(f)]. To permit the servicing fee to be sold bythe servicing Lender would negate its purpose: to provide the Lender withboth the continuing income and the incentive to service loans properlyand keep them on their books.2. The secondary market is a closely connected system that functions bestif the interests of each of the major participants_the small business Borrower,the Lender, the Broker/Dealer and the Investor_are properly balanced. Inorder to provide a better balance, a new authority for emergency repurchaseby the Lender is being implemented (paragraph 20). SBA is confronted withthe need to establish a policy for the situation in which a Borrower'sbusiness will probably fail unless a modification, such as a rate reduction,is granted. Every year a few such cases arise in which the Lender is willingto grant a rate reduction or other modification but cannot do so becauseeither the Investor is not willing or the loan is in a pool, in which caseit is infeasible to request Investor approval because of multiple Investors.SBA proposes to permit a Lender to repurchase if the SBA field office,after careful analysis, concludes that an emergency exists in which theBorrower's business will probably fail if the change is not approved andwill probably survive if the change is approved. SBA intends that thisauthority be used only in carefully selected cases. This is not to be construedas general or wholesale authority for unilateral repurchase by Lenders.Such an interpretation would be extremely damaging to the secondary market.No changes have been made from the earlier proposal in paragraph 20. Sevencommenters addressed this proposal; six supported it and one was opposed.3. Timely action is essential to an efficient secondary market. SBA isproviding a more precise definition of the time parameters of secondarymarket operations, particularly with regard to such time-sensitive activitiesas remittance by Lender of Borrower payment, the furnishing by Lender oftranscripts on loans that are in default and must be purchased, and therequired advance notice from Lender to the the fiscal and transfer agent(FTA) of Borrower's intent to prepay (paragraphs 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15,16, and 19). Remittance information (SBA Form 1502) and remittance(s) shallbe due at the FTA on the third of every month (paragraph 6(c)). SBA shalllevy a late payment penalty of 5% of the amount remitted on $100, whicheveris greater (subject to a maximum of $5,000 on lender's total monthly remittance),on any remittance or remittance information not received by the fiscaland transfer agent by the fifth of the month. Lender's FTA's failure tocomply with a request for transcript within ten business days shall resultin a $100 penalty payable to the SBA (paragraph 10(a)). Lender's failureto provide to FTA the required ten days advance notice of Borrower's intentto prepay will result in a $100 penalty (paragraph 15).If any fees or penalties are not remitted on a timely basis by lender,the SBA and the FTA reserve the right to withhold them from the settlementof any future guaranteed interest sale or payment on any defaulted guranteedloan in the Lender's portfolio. This is analogous to the offset practiceof private sector Lenders.Three commenters supported this proposal.Other, while not opposing the penalties in principle, questioned certainspecifics. One commenter believed that the fine for FTA's non-receipt ofremittance was restrictive and placed an unfair administrative burden onparticipating lenders. Another requested that the three and five calendardays be changed to three and five business days. SBA believes that thedeadline and penalty are necessary because a small but significant percentageof Lenders have consistently failed to remit in accordance with the formerrequirement that remittances be sent on the last business day of the month.In response, SBA has re-defined the deadline as date of receipt by FTAand has imposed a penalty for noncompliance. SBA does not believe the deadlineto be unreasonable. Most Borrower payments are due early in the month.In a typical case the Lender will be able to earn interest income for almosta full month on each Borrower payment.Another commenter pointed out that in many cases Lenders do not themselvesreceive ten days advance notice of a prepayment and that it is thereforeunfair for SBA to require lenders to furnish such notice to the FTA. TheSBA requirement is based upon the need to provide the FTA with sufficientwarning that it can recover the certificate from the Investor prior tothe payoff. The FTA cannot transmit the payoff to the Investor withoutfirst retrieving the certificate. Time is of the essence. Without sufficientnotice, Investors would lose interest days whenever a payoff occurs. Lenderscan protect themselves by requiring, as part of the loan agreement, thatBorrowers provide sufficient advance notice of a prepayment.A commenter suggested that penalties be imposed on the FTA as well as onLenders. Both the draft and this final revision impose penalties on theFTA for lack of timely performance of duties [see paragraph 7(d) and 11].SBA has made one technical change in paragraph 6(a) to clarify its intendthat the dates for FTA receipt of remittance information and remittance(s)apply to all the Guaranteed Interests in the Lender's portfolio that areregistered with the FTA.4. In the March draft revision, if the Borrower failed to make the firstthree payments in full due after the loan is sold into the secondary market,the Lender would be required to repurchase it from the Registered Holderat a price equal to the sum of the outstanding balance, accured interestand premium, if any, received by the Lender (paragraph 3). The Lender hasalways been required to certify that it has no knowledge of any likelydefault or prepayment by Borrower. However, some cases have occurred inwhich the loan defaults or prepays immediately upon sale. SBA proposedthis change at the request of broker-dealers in order to provide increasedinvestor protection in such cases.Ten writers commented on this proposal: seven in opposition and three insupport. Opponents had the following comments:andbullet; The market will take care of the problem, because if a Lender'sloans default in the first three months, demand for that Lender's productwill decline.andbullet; Let the parties handle it as arms-length transactions.SBA does not publish default rates or defaults during the first three monthsby individual lenders. Therefore the method proposed by these writers isnot available. SBA anticipates that there would be considerable lenderopposition to publishing such information.It is SBA's understanding that some broker-dealers are protecting themselvesagainst early prepayment by making their purchase of a Guaranteed Interestfrom a Lender contingent upon non-default by Borrower for the first threeor four months. This provides protection to the party buying from the Lender,but if the Certificate is resold or if interest is stripped, subsequentpurchasers have no such protection.Supporters of the proposal had the following recommendations:andbullet; Monies should be distributed equitably to all holders of interest,including holders of individual loans, pool portions and originator fees.andbullet; SBA should specify that the premium refund applies if the Lenderexercises its right to a deferment within the first three months.andbullet; The FTA should monitor to detect whether a situation of nonpaymentmeets the parameters of the proposed revision, to demand from Lender theappropriate sum and to notify SBA of its action. SBA should then enforcecompliance through its field offices.SBA has revised the language of the original proposal. In the final revisionpublished herein, paragraph 3 provides that if the Borrower fails to makethe first three payments in full due after the Warranty Date and if theGuaranteed Interest is repurcahsed pursuant to paragraph 10, the Lendershall purchase the Guaranteed Interest from the Registered Holder at aprice equal to the outstanding balance plus accrued interest plus the premium,if any, received by the Lender. If, in the alternative, SBA purchases theGuaranteed Interest pursuant to paragraph 11, the SBA shall pay a priceequal to the outstanding balance plus accrued interest and the Lender shallrefund the premium. Liability of the Lender for refund of the premium shallnot be affected by any deferment that may be granted under paragraph 2.SBA shall bear no liability for refund of the premium if the Lender failsto repay it. Lender's failure to reimburse the Registered Holder for thepremium may, as determined by SBA, constitute a significant violation ofthe Rules and Regulations of the Secondary Market. If the Lender has repurchasedthe Guaranteed Interest and if the Borrower subsequently makes installmentpayments in full for a period of twelve consecutive months, the Lendermay re-sell the Guaranteed Interest in the Secondary Market. The holdingperiod has been changed from six months in the previous draft to make itconsistent with that of paragraph 20.The FTA will notify the Lender and request a refund of premium whenevera purchase falls into this category. The Lender will remit the premiumrefund to the FTA, which will distribute it equitably to the RegisteredHolder(s) of Guaranteed Interest Certificates or Pool Certificates andto the owners, if any, of Originator Fees.All distributions to Certificate Holders will be made on a pro rata basis.Any case in which the lender has not remitted the refund within 30 daysof a request from the FTA will be referred to the SBA for further action.An Originator Fee is an increment of interest stripped from the interestflow on a Guaranteed Portion, primarily to facilitate pooling. Poolingrules permit a 2.0% variation (i.e. 200 basis points) in the net interestrates (Borrower rate_Lender servicing fee_FTA fee) on loans in a givenpool. The pool interest rate must equal the lowest net interest rate onany loan in the pool. For example, a pool might contain loans with netinterest rates of prime and prime +1.5%. The pool rate on such a pool mustequal prime. In this case originator fees of 1.5% would be stripped fromthe prime +1.5% loans.On a loan with Originator Fees SBA will prescribe a formula that dividesthe refund of premium according to the proportion of the premium purchasedby each of the two parties of interest: the Registered Holder(s) of theGuaranteed Interest certificate or Pool certificate(s) and the owner ofthe Originator Fee. The Registered Holder(s) will receive a proportionequal to the premium paid by the Registered Holder(s) after the loan isstripped divided by the original premium received by the lender. The ownerof the Originator Fee will receive the remainder of the premium refund.The premium received by the Lender is recorded on the records of the FTA.The premium paid by the Registered Holder after the Originator Fee is createdmay not be know, so a ``shadow price'' will have to be estimated.Consider the following example. Assume a Guaranteed Interest certificatewith an 11% net coupon, an FTA fee of \1/8\%, a 75 day payment delay, a6% constant prepayment rate (CPR), and a maturity of 120 months. Assumethat the lender receives a price of 105.8 as a percent of par. The purchaserstrips 2.0% as an originator fee. What figure should be used as the pricepaid by the Registered Holder after the loan is stripped? If the GuaranteedInterest were sold by the lender, stripped, and resold simultaneously,there would be a market price to refer to. In reality, most loans willprobably not be resold immediately but will be held in inventory to bepooled after some passage of time. Over time, supply and demand conditionschange. In addition, the creation of a pool itself produces an incrementof value due to the timely payment guaranty, the ameliorating effect ofa pool on prepayment and loss of premium, and ease of recordkeeping. Indeed,if the Originator Fee is small, \1/8\% for example, the price paid forthe pool certificate may exceed the price paid to the lender. The use ofsuch a price in the preceding formula would result in the entire refundgoing to the Registered Holder and none to the Originator Fee owner. Butthat cannot be correct, as the Originator Fee owner paid a portion of thepremium and is obviously entitled to something.There is information available to provide a determination and more accurateresult, however. The yield on the original transaction can be computedand, employing the assumption of constant yield, used to calculate a shadowprice or premium that can be incorporated into the formula. In the previousexample, the mortgage yield on the security at the point it is purchasedfrom the Lender is 9.08%. An originator fee of 2.0% is then stripped fromthis Guaranteed Interest with its 11.0% coupon, for a net coupon of 9.0%.We then calculate the price at which a 9% loan with a \1/8\% FTA fee, a75 day delay, a 6% CPR and a 120 month maturity would have to sell in orderto yield 9.08%. The answer is 98.6. The loan would have to sell at a discount.The entire premium would have been purchased by the owner of the originatorfee, who is entitled to all of the refund.If a 1.0% originator fee is stripped, the resulting 10% net coupon loanwould have to sell at 102.2 in order to yield 9.08%. Dividing 2.2 by 5.8(the premium received by the Lender) gives 0.38. Thus 38% of the refundwould be distributed to the Registered Holder(s) and 62%, to the ownerof the Originator Fee.This plan will be followed in implementing the new provision in paragraph3.5. SBA is modifying its procedures in order to encourage more timely actionby SBA and Lender when a borrower encounters problems that threaten therepayment of the loan (paragraphs 10 and 11). The goal is to encourageproper servicing action as soon as possible. The FTA will provide to eachSBA field office a monthly list of its loans that are past due accordingto the records of the FTA. The field office will contact the Lender todetermine the status of the loan. The Lender will verify whether (1) theinterest-paid-to date is more than sixty days in arrears or (2) defaultby borrower has continued uncured for more than 60 days in making payment,when due, of any installment of principal or interest due on the note.If the loan is in either category, SBA, after consultation with the Lender,will within ten days determine whether SBA or the Lender is to purchasethe Guaranteed Interest or decide upon appropriate remedial servicing actionpursuant to paragraph 2. Four commenters addressed this proposal, three in support and one in opposition.Two commenters voiced concern over the additional workload the new procedureswould place on District Offices. SBA will carefully monitor field officeperformance in implementing the new system. Technical corrections were made from the earlier proposals in paragraphs10 and 11. In addition, miscellaneous technical corrections have been made in variousother portions of the previous draft.<ITAG tagnum="6">James Abdnor, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">SBA Loan Number </ITAG><T2>XXXX </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Secondary Participation Guaranty and Certification Agreement </ITAG>Important Information <T3>This form is to be used for the initial transfer only.

SBA,Lender and Registered Holder (for itself and each subsequent RegisteredHolder) agree to the appointment by SBA of FTA to serve as the agent totransfer Certificates and to receive from Lender loan repayments made byBorrower and to transmit such payments to Registered Holder.

Modifications in the750 Agreement or to the Note not affecting repayment terms of the Notemay be effected by Lender or SBA without the consent of Registered Holder(for itself and each subsequent Registered Holder). To aid the orderlyrepayment of Borrower's indebtedness, Lender, at the request of the Borrower,may grant one deferment of Borrower's scheduled payments for a continuousperiod not to exceed three (3) months of past or future installments. Lendershall immediately notify FTA and the relevant SBA field office in writingof any deferment approval, including the GP number, the borrower's name,the term of such deferment, the date Borrower is to resume repayment ofits obligation, and reconfirmation of the basis of the interest calculation(e.g. 30/360, etc.) Interest is not waived, but deferred. Subsequent tothe deferment period, payments received from Borrower will first be appliedto accrued interest until such time as interest is paid to a current statusand then to principal and interest. Registered Holder may not demand repurchaseof the Guaranteed Interest during the deferment period, or before Borrower'sfailure to pay the first scheduled installment following the defermentperiod. Lender shall not authorize any additional deferment or an extensionof Loan maturity without the prior written consent of the Registered Holder.No change in the terms and conditions of repayment of the Note other thanthe deferment authorized in this paragraph shall be made by Lender or SBAwithout the prior written consent of Registered Holder. A request for suchpayment modification must be forwarded to the FTA, which will forward theproposed modification to the Registered Holder or provide the name of suchRegistered Holder (at Registered Holder's discretion) to the Lender fordirect negotiation.3. <T3>Representations and Acknowledgment of Lender. </T3>Lender hereby certifiesthat the Loan has been made and fully disbursed and that the full amountof the guaranty fee has been paid to SBA. The outstanding principal amountof the Guaranteed Interest and date to which interest is paid as certifiedby Lender are accepted by SBA and have been warranted by SBA to the RegisteredHolder as of the SBA Warranty Date (date this Agreement is executed andsettled by the FTA); provided, however, that Lender shall be liable toSBA for any damage to SBA resulting from any error in the certified principalamount, percentage of the Guaranteed Interest, or date to which interestis paid. Lender represents that as of the Warranty Date neither it norany of its directors, officers, employees, or agents has or should have,through the exercise of reasonable diligence, any actual or constructiveknowledge of any default by Borrower or has any information indicatingthe likehood of a default by Borrower or the likelihood of prepayment ofthe Loan (by refinancing or otherwise).If the Borrower fails to make the first three payments in full due afterthe Warranty Date and if the Guaranteed Interest is repurchased pursuantto paragraph 10, the Lender shall purchase the Guaranteed Interest fromthe Registered Holder at a price equal to the outstanding balance plusaccrued interest plus the premium, if any, received by the Lender. If,in the alternative, SBA purchases such Guaranteed Interest pursuant toparagraph 11, the SBA shall pay to the Registered Holder and amount equalto to the outstanding balance plus accrued interest and the Lender shallpay to the Registered Holder an amount equal to the premium, if any, receivedby the Lender. Liability of Lender for refund of premium shall not be affectedby any deferment that may be granted under paragraph 2. SBA shall bearno liability for refund of premium if Lender fails to refund premium.

Failure toprovide such information shall result in a $100 penalty payable to SBA.Lender agrees that purchase of the Guaranteed Interest by SBA does notrelease or otherwise modify any of Lender's obligations to SBA arisingfrom the Loan or the 750 Agreement, and that such purchase does not waiveany of SBA's rights against Lender. Lender also agrees that SBA, as thefinal owner of the Guaranteed Interest under this Agreement, in additionto all its rights under the 750 Agreement with Lender, shall also havethe right to set-off against Lender all rights inuring to SBA under thisAgreement against SBA's obligation to Lender under the 750 Agreement.
