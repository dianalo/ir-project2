The cheapest gallery sDr. Vincent P. Dole of the Rockefeller Universityin New YorkCity was given the Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award fordiscoveries concerning the physiological basis of drug addiction andthe development of methadone as an effective treatment.   U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., who was defeated in hisbid for re-election Nov. 8, was awarded the Lasker Public ServiceAward for his defense of health care programs faced with cripplingbudget cuts and for establishing new programs.   The Lasker Awards have been given for 43 years, and they haveoften anticipated the awarding of Nobel Prizes. Forty-six winners ofthe Lasker Medical Research awards have gone on to win Nobel Prizes.   One of this year's winners of the Nobel Prize in medicine, Dr.James W. Black, won a Lasker award in 1976.   Each Lasker award winner receives or shares a $15,000 honorarium.   Cech, a biochemist, was cited for his discovery that RNA _ oncethought to be merely a kind of genetic messenger inside cells _could rearrange itself to change the message.   He also found that the RNA _ or ribonucleic acid _ had arudimentary ability to reproduce itself, suggesting that the firstliving things might have arisen ultimately from RNA.   Earlier, Sharp had reported that only part of RNA carried geneticinstructions to govern the operation of cells. Certain segments ofRNA, called introns, are deleted from RNA as it is processed, andthe remaining segments, called exons, contain the instructions.   Dole began his studies of addiction in the 1960s. After gettingpermission to study heroin addicts outside of prison, he examinedthe symptoms of withdrawal and the nature of addiction.   Ultimately, he found that methadone, a synthetic opiate developedin Germany during World War II, could eliminate an addict's cravingfor heroin without making the addict ``high.'' That allowed addictsto hold jobs and resume normal lives.   Weicker was cited, in part, ``for his compassion and dedicationin the fight to eradicate disease and disability through federalfunding of medical research and public health programs.''   Among the beneficiaries of his legislative actions were disabledchildren, the mentally ill, the elderly and victims of cancer,Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and AIDS, the Lasker Foundation said.</TEXT></DOC>
