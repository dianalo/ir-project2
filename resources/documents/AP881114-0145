Slightly more than a year ago, Vanegas and 400 of his troopsended their more than 7-year-old war against the Sandinistagovernment with an agreement that allowed the rebels to return tocivilian life but keep their U.S.-supplied arms.   The war along the isolated, so-called Miskito Coast virtuallyended with Vanegas' decision to stop fighting. Since then theSandinistas, under the direction of Interior Minister Tomas Borge,have signed similar pacts with other Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indiangroups.   ``My decision was for the best,'' Vanegas said, shortly beforemeeting with Borge to discuss the agreement's progress.   But he charged that the government has sought to disarm andharass his troops, failed to provide them with enough economicsupport, and barred them from holding political meetings.   ``I can't visit the (Indian) communities. They (the Sandinistas)are afraid I'll have contact with the Contras,'' he said, referringto the main U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel group. ``There is a lot ofmistrust.''   Vanegas said that about 100 of his men had returned to thebattlefield during the past year.   He said the Contras also have banned him from going to someremote villages.   ``They say we surrendered and consider us the enemies. They won'tlet us come into their territory. We're caught in the middle,''Vanegas said.   The Indian groups received some of the millions of dollars thatthe Reagan administration gave the Contras, but most of the moneywent to rebels operating out of Honduras on the northern front and,to a lesser extent, the southern front along the Costa Rican border.   The Sandinistas and the non-Indian Contra leaders signed acease-fire agreement in March. The sides have failed to agree to apermanent truce but most of the fighting has stopped.   ``The war won't help the poor,'' Vanegas said. ``The war enrichesthose who have the arms and those who make the arms. The Miskitoscould begin a war much stronger, or there could be a lasting peace.That depends on the policies of the government.''   Asked if this meant he would again take up arms, he said, ``Yes,we will fight, go to war, it's up to the government.''   Borge, on a trip to the Atlantic Coast, held three closed-doorsessions during the weekend with Vanegas and leaders of other groupsthat gave up the fight.   Borge said later that Vanegas aired his complaints and hadindicated ``quite the opposite'' from intending to return to war.   Several of the Indians asked Borge for more government money, arequest not easily filled in this financially devastated nation. Theeconomy suffered a severe blow when Hurricane Joan struck Nicaragualast month and ravaged the southern Atlantic coastal city ofBluefields.</TEXT></DOC>
