Mr. Fish, 35 years old, has been in that post since 1977. He will be succeeded by Arthur L. Carter, 56, who is the major financial partner in Nation Co., which was formed in 1985 to acquire the Nation from a limited partnership. Victor Navasky, editor of the Nation, and Mr. Fish are partners in the holding company. Mr. Carter also is founder and publisher of the Litchfield County Times, a Connecticut newspaper.    During Mr. Fish's tenure, the 122-year-old Nation has quadrupled its circulation to 85,000, the company said. Mr. Fish's father, Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr., is a veteran Republican congressman from New York's 21st Congressional District. His grandfather, Hamilton Fish Sr., held the same congressional seat. Hamilton Fish III, who is leaving the Nation to pursue other interests, has said his plans include &quot;exploring a possible run for elective office.&quot;    Mr. Fish attributed the Nation's circulation increase in part to current-affairs programs that he and Mr. Navasky initiated outside the magazine, such as the Nation's 1979 conference on governmental intervention in conjunction with Columbia University's School of International Affairs, and the Boston Roundtable, a conference on arms control and disarmament in 1984 and 1985 at the Divinity School of Harvard University.    Mr. Fish couldn't be reached for comment on whether he will retain his financial stake in the publication. Mr. Navasky said editorial policy won't change. </TEXT></DOC>
