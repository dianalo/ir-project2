Klein </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Chino Hills, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A hurdler pushing 30 normally is thought to be on the verge of dotage, but Greg Foster only chuckles at the notion. &quot;The older I get, the easier my event seems to be,&quot; he says, crossing his long legs in the living room of his comfortable spread in this high and airy suburb east of Los Angeles.    &quot;The training part is easier because I've learned the value of rest in keeping sharp, mentally and physically. The actual racing part has been easier since I stopped paying attention to what my opponents have to say about me. If they want to play psych games, that's their business. My time is too valuable for that.&quot;    The issue of time is always pertinent on the running track, but seldom more so than in the high-hurdle sprints that have been Foster's bastion in recent years. With the return to action of outdoor world-record holder Renaldo Nehemiah, and the presence on the boards of 1984 Olympic champion Roger Kingdom and 1987 world-indoor champ Tonie Campbell, the events have emerged as the main attraction of the current indoor campaign.    Spicing the rivalry is a large-sized dose of enmity stemming from snipes and snubs too numerous to mention, or sort out, here. Suffice it to say that the timber-toppers are a testy troupe. But it's no wonder that these guys don't get along, because the stopwatch differences between them are too close for comfort.    On Jan. 22 at the Sunkist meet in Los Angeles, the season's first indoor biggie, Foster snapped the tape at 55 meters in seven seconds flat, followed by Nehemiah at 7.11, Campbell at 7.13 and Kingdom at 7.14. Barring late scratches, much the same field will have at it again tonight at New York's Millrose Games in Madison Square Garden, and Feb. 13 at the Vitalis/U.S. Olympic Invitational at the Meadowlands in Rutherford, N.J. Igor Kazanov of the Soviet Union, fifth in the World Championships in Rome last year, also will be at the New Jersey meet.    The pick of this crowded field looks like Foster. He capped a highly successful 1987 season by winning his second quadrennial world outdoor title. That's in addition to a vanload of NCAA and U.S. national championships, outdoors and in, dating from 1978. Perhaps equally important, Foster now has won four consecutive races against Nehemiah, his longtime nemesis before Nehemiah chucked track in 1982 for a four-year fling as a pro-football pass catcher.    Nehemiah has conceded Foster's No. 1 ranking -- at least for now -- and Foster can only agree with that assessment. &quot;The rivalry isn't that important to me anymore; Renaldo is just another guy I want to beat,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;The sport itself offers enough barriers without adding personal ones.&quot;    Indeed, if it's barriers you want, hurdling has them aplenty. To get an idea how high a high-hurdle really is, stand a foot-long ruler atop your desk. Then picture 10 of those 42-inch skeletal monsters spaced along a track over the classic, 110-meter outdoor distance. You wouldn't be the only one to find daunting the prospect of leaping all that lumber. &quot;The first time my high-school coach suggested I try hurdles, I told him to forget it, that I was too scared,&quot; Foster recalls. &quot;Back then, they used big, heavy wooden hurdles, and you'd be sore for a week if you banged one.&quot; But he says that the more he thought about the event, the more it intrigued him. &quot;I guess I was attracted by how hard it was,&quot; he smiles. &quot;I liked the idea of doing something that put off other people.&quot;    Big for a young hurdler at 6-feet-3 and 185 pounds -- he's 10 pounds heavier now -- Foster's early forte was power. In college at UCLA, and even later, he'd sometimes topple as many hurdles as he'd clear in a race. He avers that while his times were good (his 13.03 on the heels of Nehemiah's world record 12.93 at Zurich in 1981 is the second-best ever) his form was poor. &quot;The talent came before the technique,&quot; he says. &quot;In those days, I just ran all-out.&quot;    He admits that his preference for his own company may have slowed his progress over the years. He mostly coached himself before coming under the guidance of Bob Kersee, who oversees his World Class Track Club, last year. &quot;Bob doesn't so much coach me as film me,&quot; Greg notes. &quot;We watch the films together. If I ask a question, he answers. Otherwise, he leaves me alone. I assimilate things best that way.&quot;    In the opinion of Kersee, who doubles as the coach and husband of world-champion heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Foster has developed into &quot;as good a technical hurdler as you'll see these days.&quot; He's also among the most relaxed. In season, he trains on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at Kersee's UCLA base, taking off the other three days if he's not scheduled to compete. He also takes almost total vacations from his sport in October and November, after the outdoor season, and in March and April, after running indoors.    The result is a more efficient hurdler than previously but not a notably luckier one. His two biggest losses last year -- at the world indoor meet and the Pan Am Games -- resulted from spills that most observers blamed on other runners. The mishaps recalled his eyelash loss to Kingdom in the '84 Olympics after a false start gave him pause at the gun.    Foster would like to win an Olympic gold medal before he retires, and break Nehemiah's outdoor mark. The try for gold should come in September in Seoul; record runs can't be scheduled. &quot;I thought I was on a world-record pace when I went down at the Pan Am Games,&quot; he says. &quot;I know it's just a tenth of a second difference, but when you've run as long as I have, you can feel it. And once you feel it, you want to feel it again. That's reason enough to keep running.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
