Gov. Mike Dukakis, who last night accepted theDemocratic nomination for the White House at the convention palacejust half a mile from the house of Scarlet, instead faces hisproblems mumbling ``I will think about it now.'' His mother sayswith a smile that the first words spoken by Dukakis were in Greek``monos mou,'' or ``let me do it by myself,'' and as a student,activist, professor, governor and presidential candidate Dukakisdid it all by himself, without clamor, without second thoughts,without snobbery.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Rome's La Repubblica (liberal):   ``The convention in Atlanta has also confirmed a truth that weEuropeans have known for some time: the barrenness today of theleft, of any left, in its normal function of political planning.Dukakis takes with him from the convention, on the 100 days to Nov.8, no idea of society, no program. There is only the promise of agood administration, and of greater compassion for the poorerAmerica from a candidate whose merits in front of history are two:   ``Firstly to have put in order the accounts of his state,Massachusetts, and secondly of being a little less disagreeable, ofhaving a character that is little less flaccid, than George Bush.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _</TEXT><HEAD>PERU</HEAD><TEXT>   President Alan Garcia spoke in support Thursday of theDemocratic Party platform regarding Latin America and said heexpects ``great dialogue'' between North and South America tofollow the U.S. presidential election.   ``There are new winds blowing in the United States. I have readthe Democratic platform. It calls for non-confrontation with LatinAmerica and peaceful and harmonious relations,'' Garcia, a SocialDemocrat, told 30 officials from across the continent meeting inLima to discuss Latin American cooperation.   Garcia indicated a Democratic program would be positive for theregion.   ``The Democratic platform speaks of economic cooperation andmentions the foreign debt. Whatever the election result, we willhave a new situation in a few months. I think 1989 could be a yearof great dialogue,'' said Garcia, who has frequently charged thatthe policies of the United States and other industrializedcountries toward Latin America are imperialistic.</TEXT><TEXT>   _</TEXT><HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD><TEXT>   Government-run Radio South Africa said in an editorial broadcasttoday:   ``According to reports, leaders of America's Democratic Partyare quietly distancing Mr. Michael Dukakis from the radical foreignpolicy stands forced on him at the party convention by Mr. JesseJackson. The shift, to make the presidential candidate moreacceptable to the voters, includes South Africa. In particular, thereference to South Africa as an `terrorist state' has beenconspicuously absent from speeches.   ``If a substantive change is in fact taking place it will bewelcomed not only in South Africa but by many Western leaders forwhom terrorism is much too serious a threat to civilized society tobe exploited for personal political gain. Most are well aware thatwith respect to terrorism South Africa, far from being a sponsor,has been a target of a sustained campaign. It has conductedcross-border raids against the ANC _ but it has done so _ as othercountries have -- under the legal doctrines of hot pursuit andpre-emptive strikes.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _</TEXT><HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD><TEXT>   The Asahi Shimbun (liberal) commented in its editorial today onthe appointment of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Dukakis' runningmate.   ``In order to unify the party which consists of a diversity ofopinions, he (Dukakis) has to become the middle core of the partyfirst. Then, he needs to absorb conservative voices, which Benstenrepresents, and liberal groups which support Jesse Jackson ...   ``It must be the result of careful deliberation, but thedifferences between the two (Dukakis and Bensten) still stand out.They not only differ in their lifestyles but also politicalstandpoint...   ``Dukakis opposes such critical issues as aid to the Contras,tax reduction, the MX missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative,the death penalty, and balancing the budget, while Bensten is infavor of all of them ...   ``What was remarkable in the convention was the outstandingperformance of Jesse Jackson. He appears to have decided tocooperate with Dukakis to unify the party ahead of the Novemberelection, but the fact that the rise of the Rainbow Coalition,which represents interests of blacks, Hispanics, minority groupsand the low-income class, indicates the emergence of a new flow inthe American society.''</TEXT></DOC>
