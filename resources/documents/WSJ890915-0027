Reports of intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of Japan helped churn dollar trading, foreign-exchange traders said.    They said the impetus for the U.S. currency's volatility arose mostly from a last-minute urge to adjust positions ahead of five U.S. economic indicators due today. The prospect of interpreting the variety of indicators, let alone their collective significance, is enough to make most participants jumpy about holding exposed positions, traders said.    &quot;It's going to be a complicated day {today}, I think,&quot; said Michael Penzer, vice president and senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco. &quot;The market might have a case of schizophrenia and want to check itself into a mental hospital.&quot;    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9755 marks, up from 1.9705 marks late Wednesday, and at 146.86 yen, up from 146.33 yen. Sterling was at $1.5535, down from $1.5600.    The U.S. currency was well above its lows of 1.9590 marks and 145.47 yen, hit in early Tokyo dealings, but was off its peaks of the day, set in New York at 1.9783 marks and 146.90 yen.    Dollar sales by the Bank of Japan and independent major Asian institutions provoked an early round of selling when the dollar was at a technical weak point in Tokyo dealings, traders said. The dollar hit its intraday lows but had recovered partially when European trading began.    Then, a rumor of an imminent Bundesbank interest rate increase, which had circulated Wednesday, again unnerved participants, and the dollar slipped.    But the central bank's denial of the rumor sparked a widespread short-covering rally that was interrupted only briefly by news that U.S. retail sales in August rose 0.7%, less than the expected 1.0%. The retail sales figures implied that economic activity may not have been as strong as recently suggested.    But with the indicators due today overshadowing the market, short-covering resumed until Fed intervention at the dollar's peaks stemmed the rise.    Compared with today's other data, the trade figure is the hardest to estimate, giving it a fair chance to catch the market off guard, Mr. Penzer said. Estimates of the July deficit have ranged from $7.5 billion to about $10 billion.    Participants also will watch the August producer price index for signs inflation has picked up, suggesting the Fed might need to raise interest rates, which in turn would attract more money to the dollar. A drop in the index would give the Fed room to ease credit, if needed, potentially hurting the U.S. currency. The index is expected to be unchanged from July, after falling 0.4% from June.    The data on August industrial output and capacity and July business inventories will give some idea of whether indications of a recent perk in economic activity are broad-based and substantial. That could, in turn, suggest a rebound in foreign investment in the U.S., aiding the dollar.    Trading between non-dollar currencies picked up yesterday, contributing to the jostling of the dollar, dealers said.    The mark gained ground against the yen, bolstered by the perception an interest rate increase by the Bundesbank would come much earlier than any similar move by the Bank of Japan. When the mark consolidated over a resistance level around 74.20 yen, technically motivated buying of the mark lofted it to a peak near 74.50 yen in late Asian trading.    At the New York finish, the mark was fetching 74.35 yen, up from 74.22 yen late in New York on Wednesday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 60 cents to $360.50 an ounce. Estimated volume was 3.1 million ounces.    Markets in Japan and Hong Kong are closed Friday for holidays. </TEXT></DOC>
