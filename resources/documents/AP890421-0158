Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg will urge Washington to end its opposition toearly talks with the Soviet Union on the missiles issue, saidgovernment officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The decision came out of talks between leaders of thegovernment's governing coalition parties that forged a commonpolicy on the missile debate, sources said.   Genscher and Stoltenberg are scheduled to fly to Washington onMonday for talks with U.S. officials.   West Germany has resisted strong U.S. and British calls toupgrade the current aging generation of short-range nuclearmissiles.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants NATO to postpone a decision on themissiles until after West Germany's national election in December1990.   Kohl's party has lost heavily in recent state elections and adecision to replace the aging missiles with new weapons would beunpopular with voters in West Germany, where the current missilesare deployed and where the new ones would also be located.   Genscher has repeatedly called for early talks with the WarsawPact to reduce the number of short-range missiles.   The United States and Britian are strongly opposed to earlytalks, contending that Warsaw Pact superiority in conventionalweapons requires a Western nuclear deterrent of short-range weapons.   A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers that ended Thursdayin Brussels sidestepped the issue.   Government sources said that during the coalition talks, leadersof Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union Party agreed todrop their long-standing opposition to early talks on short-rangemissiles.   The position paper also reiterates Kohl's view that a WestGerman decision on deployment of the modernized weapons is notnecessary until 1991 or 1992.   The policy document urges the United States and the Soviet Unionto negotiate on reduction of the missiles during the interim.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said the rulingcoalition parties agreed on the common stand on the missile issueduring an intensive round of talks in Bonn late Thursday.   Chrobog refused to give details until NATO allies had beeninformed of the results of the talks.   Government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl had telephonedPresident Bush on Friday to inform him of the West German position.He refused to elaborate.   During the NATO meeting that ended Thursday, the United Statesand Britain sought strong backing for plans to modernize thearsenal, while several European nations pressed for earlynegotiations with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to reduce the missiles.   The May 29-30 summit in Brussels is scheduled to discuss ablueprint for the 16-nation NATO's future arms control strategy andwill have to tackle some of the modernization issues the alliesskipped over this week.   A senior U.S. official said Friday in Brussels that NATO mayfail to resolve in the coming weeks its deep differences overmissile negotiations with the East bloc.   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, raised thepossibility that NATO members would not reach a common position intime for the May summit.   ``We may in fact find ourselves at the summit with stillserious, genuine differences, and in that case they may not be ableto be bridged,'' he said.   Such an outcome probably would lead to speculation aboutdisarray in the Western alliance. The nations are struggling topresent a united front in the face of defense cut promises bySoviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that have wide public appeal.   The current missiles have a range of a more than 60 miles.   The upgraded missiles would be extended to more than 250 miles,just under the limits of the 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty thateliminated intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Thetreaty covered missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,000 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
