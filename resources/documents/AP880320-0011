The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry said the raid was on Nicaraguanterritory and caused no damage. Azcona, in a telephone interviewwith The Associated Press, would neither confirm nor deny theattack, but the Honduran military said it occurred on the Honduranside of the ill-defined border.   Honduras says the Sandinistas crossed the frontier in the Bocayregion last week in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Thousandsof U.S. troops have been sent to Honduras as a show of force, butofficials say they will not be sent to combat areas.   Azcona threatened the Sandinistas Friday with air raids unlessthey pulled out of Honduras. Nicaragua has denied its troopscrossed the border, but a Sandinista military official hasindicated Nicaraguan troops entered Honduras.   The Honduran statement, issued by military intelligence lateSaturday, said the raid was ordered by the military high command``with the objective of forcing the immediate withdrawal of theNicaraguan troops from our soil.''   The statement said two U.S.-made F-5 fighter jets carried outthe raid but it gave no further details of the attack.   The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry statement issued in Managua saidthe raid was in the same area where Honduran jets dropped severalbombs on Thursday. Honduras has said that raid also was on its sideof the border.   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto sent a protest noteto Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez, saying his government``energetically and formally protests'' the attack, which it called``aggression against Nicaraguan territory.''   The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry statement said two American-madeF-5 jets staged a 10-minute attack Saturday afternoon in the Bocayarea about 65 miles northeast of Managua, dropping four bombsagainst Sandinista army positions but causing no damage.   The ministry also said two F-5 warplanes flew over Sandinistapositions Saturday morning in the frontier sectors of Mukuwas, SanAndres de Bocay, Waniwas and Wayawas, but dropped no bombs.   There was no immediate comment by Honduras on the reportedoverflight.   Both incursions were repelled by Sandinista anti-aircraft fire,the ministry said.   Azcona had announced he was sending more troops to the Bocayregion and also said he would not hesitate to seek more U.S. help.   A few hours after Azcona made the statements and beforeNicaragua reported its territory was being bombed, the Honduranarmed forces said the Nicaraguans were pulling back.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, the armed forces spokesman, saidin a telephone interview ``their troops are withdrawing. About 600Sandinista soldiers are still inside our country, and the rest haveabandoned the area during the past 24 hours.''   Azcona had said before the armed forces announced theNicaraguans were withdrawing that the situation in the mountainousBocay region deteriorated when Sandinista troops re-enteredHonduras after having retreated to the Nicaraguan side. Heestimated the Nicaraguan strength in Honduras at about 2,000 bySaturday morning.   The president told The Associated Press he was reinforcing the2,000 Honduran troops at the border with several more battalions.   A Honduran military intelligence officer, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said Honduran troops surrounded the Sandinistas andwere to shoot or capture any Nicaraguan soldiers found on the wrongside of the border.   About 3,200 U.S. troops have been sent to Honduras at therequest of the Honduran government since Thursday. The Pentagonsaid the troops would be in Central America for about 10 days.   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has said his government isstill willing to hold peace talks Monday with the Contras. A rebelspokesman said the Contras also are willing to negotiate.   Nicaragua is thought to be trying to wipe out Contra bases alongthe border and a large rebel supply depot in the jungle north ofSan Andres de Bocay.   Ortega said he was appealing to the International Court ofJustice for an injunction to prevent action that would heightentension between the nations, and he asked the United Nations toinvestigate the border dispute.   The decisions of what is known as the World Court, a U.N. agencybased in Holland, are rarely enforceable unless both sides agree toits jurisdiction.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar decided to send a U.N.team to Nicaragua at Nicaragua's request, said U.N. spokesmanMahbub Ahmad. Diplomatic sources said the team was likely toinclude two military observers and probably would leave on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
