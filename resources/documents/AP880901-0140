Dukakis called the Republican nominee a member of theReagan administration's ``environmental wrecking crew.''   While the two presidential candidates traded rhetorical salvosover the environment, former contender Jesse Jackson denied reportsthat aides to Dukakis had told him not to campaign in severalstates.   The Democratic nominee, upon ariving in California Wednesdaynight, said that he will be meeting with leaders of the Jacksoncampaign, ``who are already becoming a very important part of ourcampaign in California.''   ``The Democratic Party has never been so united as it is thisyear,'' Dukakis said.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Embargoed for Release at 4 p.m. EDT</HEAD><TEXT>   Later, in a speech today for the Oakland public school system,Dukakis criticized his GOP rival for ``playing hooky'' while theReagan administration cut education programs.   ``And where was George while all this was going on? Where wasthe man who now says he wants to be the education president? He wasplaying hooky. He was nowhere to be found,'' Dukakis said inprepared remarks.   He charged the Reagan administration has eliminated remedialmath and reading programs for 500,000 poor children, while inMassachusetts he started an ``essential skills'' program. TheReagan administration sought cuts in the remedial programs in 1981but was unsuccessful. In an April 1988 report, the EducationDepartment said the number of children in remedial programs haddropped from 5 million in 1979-80 to 4.5 million in the 1985-86school year.</TEXT><HEAD>End of Embargoed Material</HEAD><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   Bush, who took an early morning boat tour of the polluted harborin Dukakis' hometown, said Dukakis had sought permission fromformer Environmental Protection Agency administrator WilliamRuckelshaus to delay a ban on dumping wastes in the harbor.Dukakis' first administration prepared the papers to do so, but itwas his successor, Ed King, who actually filed the EPA request.   ``Two hundred years ago tea was spilled in the Boston harbor inthe name of liberty,'' the vice president said. ``If tea werespilled in the Boston harbor today it would desolve in the residueof my opponent's neglect and delay.''   While campaigning in his opponent's backyard, Bush was greetedby about 70 Dukakis supporters who chanted, ``Where was George?'' _a refrain questioning Bush's role in the Reagan administration.   A new national poll, meanwhile, shows Bush and Dukakis in a deadheat, but a 2-to-1 sentiment that the Democratic vice presidentialnominee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, is more qualified than Sen.Dan Quayle of Indiana, the Republican nominee for the No. 2 slot.   Another poll found Dukakis running even against Bush inMassachusetts, two months after the governor led the Republicannominee by 14 percentage points in a similar survey.   In the Boston Herald poll of 400 likely Massachusetts votersconducted Wednesday, Dukakis and Bush were tied at 42 percent eachwith 15 percent undecided and one percent favoring other candidates.   ``I can't believe it _ in Massachusetts?'' a pleased Bushresponded when shown the newspaper headline.   Bush, who aides said was trying to separate himself from Reaganadministration policies on the environment, began touting the newtheme Wednesday during an appearance on the shore of Lake Erie inMichigan.   Promising swift action on acid rain if elected, Bush also saidhe would convene a global conference during his first year inoffice to address the problem of the warming of the atmosphere. Hefurther called for wetlands protection and pledged a policy of``zero tolerance'' for polluters.   ``I am an environmentalist, always have been, from my earliestdays growing up and then as a congressman ... and I always willbe,'' he said in Michigan.   Dukakis on Wednesday shifted blame to the Reagan administration,saying it tried to eliminate federal funding for waste treatmentplants, and called Bush an election-year convert to theenvironmental cause.   ``I understand Mr. Bush was in Michigan talking about theenvironment,'' Dukakis said. ``Coming from somebody who was acharter member of the environmental wrecking crew which went toWashington in 1981, that's very strange indeed.''   Dukakis is campaigning today on the West Coast in an effort towin back conservative Democrats who voted for President Reagan inthe last two elections.   In Atlanta, Jackson was meeting with a number of key supportersa week after meeting quietly with the Dukakis camp.   Jackson met with Dukakis aides in Washington last week and wasreportedly angered by the suggestion he stay out of several states.According to one participant in the discussions, who asked not tobe identified, the request was withdrawn.   The Dukakis campaign denied such a suggestion was made andJackson, in an appearance on ``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``No, thatnever has happened.''   ``I would assume that there will be a lot of focus between nowand Labor Day _ the time is getting late _ to determine whetherthere will be targeted states, where priorities will be,'' Jacksonsaid on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.   Dukakis and Jackson made a pact at the Democratic convention inAtlanta in July that essentially was designed to give the Jacksonconstituency and its issues a voice in the Democratic generalelection campaign.   Both Bush and Dukakis came out just about even in the newestpoll, but the survey also found that Bush's attacking campaignstyle has yet to win over the Reagan Democrats.   According to the ABC-Washington Post poll released Wednesday,Dukakis led Bush 48 percent to 47 percent, a statistical dead heatbecause of the 3.5-point margin of error.   Bush's harsh attacks on Dukakis' patriotism and defensepositions have had no effect on Dukakis' lead among the ReaganDemocrats, who favor Dukakis 58-34.   The survey also found twice as many voters thought Democraticvice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was more qualified thanQuayle.   The survey of 1,129 registered, likely voters was begun lastWednesday and ended Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
