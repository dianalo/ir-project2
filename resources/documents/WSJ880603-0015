Evans's responsibilities but also appeared to move aside a potential rival to Mr. Evans.    Minneapolis-based First Bank, one of the nation's top 25 bank holding companies, got caught in a huge losing bet on interest rates beginning a little more than a year ago, and has since seen profits slide. The bet involved, in the form of an $8 billion government bond portfolio, was personally overseen by Mr. Evans, First Bank's No. 2 official.    The personnel moves made yesterday concentrate more of First Bank's business directly under D.H. Ankeny Jr., its chairman and chief executive officer.    Richard W. Schoenke, 44 years old and a vice chairman of First Bank, lost his position as head of the company's big Twin Cities banking operation, the largest part of the company. He now will head a group of staff departments, including audit, exam, legal and administration.    Mr. Schoenke, who was considered by some bankers both inside and outside First Bank as a rival to Mr. Evans, was given the new title of chief administrative officer, and will report to Mr. Ankeny. Those staff areas previously reported directly to the chairman.    There have been rumors of tension between Messrs. Ankeny and Evans since the disastrous bond play, though they have denied any differences.    Mr. Ankeny, in an interview, called rumors of such tension &quot;garbage.&quot; He said of himself and Mr. Evans, &quot;We are still a team.&quot; He said Mr. Schoenke's reassignment wasn't a demotion. &quot;It's one of the key jobs. Those are important functions that had reported to me.&quot; Mr. Ankeny said the moves will allow both him and Mr. Evans to spend more time on customer business.    Messrs. Schoenke and Evans couldn't be reached for comment.    First Bank said Jay B. Walters, 42, an executive vice president, was given charge of all commercial banking and will report to Mr. Evans now instead of Mr. Schoenke.    Mark W. Sheffert, 40, an executive vice president, was given charge of consumer and small-business banking, in addition to his trust department and financial services roles, and will now report to Mr. Ankeny. He formerly reported to Mr. Evans.    William F. Farley, 44, an executive vice president who formerly headed consumer and small-business banking, resigned, the company said.    As previously reported, First Bank's profit for the first quarter slid 39%, to $34.9 million, or 56 cents a share, though the company said the remaining three quarters would be better. Its big bond portfolio had unrealized losses of $478 million at March 31, narrower than last year's peak of about $640 million.    First Bank has said it doesn't plan to sell the bonds and thus won't take those losses, though the position does cut into interest income. </TEXT></DOC>
