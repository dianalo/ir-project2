 The latest x86 and 680x0 chips arein fact code museums, not CISC chips, intended to support their enormoussoftware bases.andP;  (The excellent term &quot;code museum&quot; was apparently coined byGordon Bell.)andP;  The reason they have, for instance, fewer registers than onewould like in 1990 is because they have to provide binary compatibility forcode written for the 8088 and 68000 back in 1980.andP;  The 32532 is a code museumfor code developed for the 16032, and the Z80000 is a code museum for Z8000code.andM;The chief competitors of the code museums, we are led to believe, are theartifacts of a new religion called RISC.andP;  The two processors (SPARC and29000) that most closely follow the RISC religion thereby require 32multiply-step instructions to perform an integer multiply, plus up to eightmore clocks for a trap or function call.andP;  Remember, nothing else can happenin those 40 clocks.andP;  Some programmers working with the latest &quot;highperformance&quot; SPARC unit, the 330, say that it is a Pig when doing integerarithmetic.andM;Other chips usually called RISC processors do not in fact follow the RISCphilosophy with respect to integer multiplies.andP;  The MIPS chip has a specialfunctional unit that performs the multiply independently (other instructionscan proceed during this multiply) with a latency of eight clocks.andP;  The 88000uses its floating-point unit to perform integer multiplies; again,instructions can proceed in parallel.andP;  By not following the RISC philosophy,MIPS and the 88000 gain a significant performance advantage.andM;The RISC followers would have you believe that they alone try to makeinstructions run in the fewest clocks.andP;  Bull puckey.andP;  Worse, RISC zealotsbrag about their super-efficient load-store architectures.andP;  Hah.andP;  The i486, amere code museum, performs push/pop operations 2.5 times faster than Sun'slatest and highest-performing SPARC system (the 330).andP;  Why?andP;  One reason isthat the i486 uses part of its budget of 1.2 million transistors to performthe register increment/decrement in parallel.andP;  This violates the RISCphilosophy, so the SPARC and other RISC chips don't do it.andM;In other words, some of the &quot;RISC features&quot; are not exclusive to RISC, andsome of the features that are exclusive to RISC degrade performance.andM;Are the i486 and 68040, then, the fastest possible chips?andP;  No; they're thefastest code museums that Intel and Motorola could make.andP;  Because they have ahuge number of active devices, they are almost as fast as the conventional32-bit RISC chips, which have the significant advantage of larger registersets and an instruction set optimized for the 32-bit world rather than a 16-or 8-bit world.andM;The simple fact is, if you use that 1.2 million transistor budget to build adevice that does not have to support ancient code, you can build a hell of afast device.andP;  Much faster than the SPARC, MIPS, 88000, or 29000, all of whichhave comparatively modest silicon budgets.andP;  Intel has proved this point withthe i860.andP;  The i860 is not a religious artifact or code museum, but a veryfast processor, looking sometimes like a RISC chip, sometimes like a CISCchip, and sometimes like a DSP chip.andM;The Intel i860 routinely performs single-precision floating-point math fromfour to twelve times faster than the MIPS or the 88000, even though both ofthose chips are capable of initiating a single-precision floating-pointoperation on every clock cycle.andM;How can this be?andM;How to Build a Fast ChipandM;The answer to that question is the real issue facing the next generation ofmicroprocessors.andP;  The answer is concurrency.andP;  To run fast, you want a hell ofa lot of concurrency.andP;  You get a hell of a lot of concurrency by having ahuge silicon budget.andP;  The i860 has a huge silicon budget.andP;  The i860 has ahell of a lot of concurrency.andM;Why are the MIPS and 88000 chips limited to a throughput of about sevensingle-precision MFLOPS at best, even though they are in principle capable ofissuing instructions at a 25-MFLOP rate?andP;  Simple.andP;  On those clocks where theyissue a load or store, they cannot issue a math operation.andP;  And because, inconformance with RISC theory, they don't have an autoincrement address mode,they also don't issue a math operation when incrementing the address pointeror index.andP;  (There are other issues: Slower clock, 32-bit external data bus,no on-board data cache.andP;  But the biggie is the lack of concurrency.eandM;The i860, which is sampling now at 33 MHz and will run at 40 MHz in itsproduction version, can perform all of the following in a single clock:andM;1.andP;  Execute a 32-bit floating-point multiplyandM;2.andP;  Execute a 32-bit floating-point add or subtractandM;3a.andP;  Initiate a 64-bit floating-point register load or store that will taketwo clocks, orandM;3b.andP;  Initiate a 128-bit floating-point load or store, taking four clocks tofinish.andM;4.andP;  Increment, by an arbitrary amount, the address pointer that was just usedfor the load or store operation in (3a) or (3b)andM;As a result of the above, the i860 can do 21-bit convolutions (a commonimage-processing task) at 78 MFLOPS throughput.andP;  Not six or seven.andO;SEventy-eight.andP;  Performing back propagations, FFTs, or matrix inversions, itwill run at about 36 MFLOPS.andM;The fastest SPARC workstation that Sun is now shipping, the model 330, takesabout 40 clocks to perform an integer multiply.andP;  The model 330 runs at 25MHz, so that's 1.6 microseconds.andP;  During those 40 clocks, nothing else goeson in the integer execution unit.andP;  In that same 1.6 microseconds, the i860can:andM;* perform 64 32-bit multiplies.andM;* perform 64 32-bit floating-point addsandM;* do 256 bytes of memory I/OandM;* and perform all autoincrement addressing to support that memory I/OandM;And get this: If you use 128-bit load/stores for your I/O, the integer unithas 48 clocks left over to do something else while all this is going on.andP;  Allthis while the SPARC is executing one integer instruction.andP;  Isn't RISCwoderful?andM;True, the i860 is only good for floating-point number-crunching and (mostly)3-D graphics acceleration.andP;  But Intel is coming out with a new chip, thesuperscalar i960.andP;  This is a completely new design, with a 64-bit externaldata bus, some elaborate schedulers, and three on-board integer-onlyexecution units.andP;  This gives the new i960 a peak performance of 66 MIPS at a33 MHZ clock rate.andP;  No, those two numbers are not reversed; the i960 willperform two instructions per clock.andP;  The third execution unit is provided sothat the unit can catch up if the scheduler postpones an instruction becauseof a resource (register) conflict.andM;You'll be able to purchase a work-station that uses the i960 for the main CPUand an i860 for floating-point and graphics for under $15K.andM;Intel paid for the performance of the i860 in cash.andP;  With its Randamp;D budget of86.6 million dollars per quarter, Intel is spending $ 780 million dollars pergeneration of microprocessors out of its own pocket.andP;  Intel has also receivedsubstantial funds ($100 million or so) from Siemens to develop the originali960 chip.andP;  That's why Intel was able to introduce two microprocessordesigns, each with about 1.2 million active transistors, in a two-monthperiod.andP;  And the new superscalar i960 will be introduced later this year.andO;Where did the money come from?andP;  Why, from profits generated by the 386 familyof chips, of course.andM;Hardware engineer Hal Hardenbergh follows developments in microprocessortechnology closely.andP;  He also (but not often enough) writes about hisconclusions, which are always entertaining, frequently outrageous, andusually right on target.andP;  The following essay on RISC, CISC, and the Inteli860 came to us shortly after Hal had a chance to evaluate the i860.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
