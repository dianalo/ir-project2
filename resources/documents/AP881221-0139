The bioinsecticide, or Cxc-Bt, was developed by Crop GeneticsInternational Corp. of Hanover, Md., and is aimed at controlling theEuropean corn borer, a pest estimated to cost $400 million in lossesannually to the nation's corn crop.   A series of tests was performed in Maryland this year and CropGenetics said it will seek further approval from the AgricultureDepartment and the Environmental Protection Agency to carry outadditional field trials in 1989 at various locations, includingmajor corn areas of the Midwest.   ``The scientific data from our field trials in Maryland confirmsthe environmental safety of our bioinsecticide,'' said Peter S.Carlson, chief scientist and co-founder of the company.   Some environmentalists had feared the bioinsecticide might spreadto other plants or to humans and other animal species.   But Crop Genetics said the Maryland tests showed that Cxc-Bt doesnot multiply or survive outside its host plant. The Cxc part of the``vaccine'' was described as a naturally occurring microorganismwhich can live only inside a plant's vascular system.   The Bt part ``is lethal to the borer but harmless to humans,animals, birds and non-target insects,'' the company said. Theproduct, which the firm calls InCide, is inserted in corn seed andthen enables corn plants to grow their own biopesticide against theborer.   Company officials said the 1989 field tests will include yieldand production information to see how well the biopesticide performs.</TEXT></DOC>
