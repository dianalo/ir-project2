Field of the invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to an endoscope, and more specifically an      optical system for endoscopes. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the prior art </PAR><PAR>  In the recent years, there have been increasingly used endoscopes so      adapted as to observe object images on TV units while forming object      images with solid-state image sensors such as CCD arranged in the distal      ends, as well as endoscopes equipped with laser scalpels. </PAR><PAR>  However, since the solid-state image sensors have high sensitivity to the      infrared light, the sensors may form object images different from those      observed by naked eyes, thereby causing misjudgment of affected parts.      Further, since the YAG laser beam having a spectra component in the      infrared region (approximately at 1061 nm) is used as the light source for      the laser scalpels, the solid-state image sensors may be overflowed by the      intense infrared light when the laser scalpels are operated, thereby      whitening the entire screen surfaces (the same phenomenon as that caused      by too bright light) and making object images invisible. Furthermore,      since the YAG laser emits very intense light, the observer is placed in a      very dangerous circumstance when the very intense light is reflected on an      object and reaches to the observer's eyes through an observation optical      system. Therefore, it is general to weaken the laser, before attaining to      the solid-state image sensors and human eyes, by arranging infrared light      cut filters at adequate positions in the objective optical systems. The      infrared light cut filters are of a type which reduces the infrared light,      before attaining to the solid-state image sensors and human eyes, by      absorbing the infrared light or another type which reduces the infrared      light, before attaining to the solid-state image sensors and human eyes,      by reflecting the infrared light. Though the infrared light cut filters      generally used have a function to reduce infrared light intensity down to      some fractions on the order at the second to third position below decimal      point, it is necessary to serially arrange two or more filters at a time      when the infrared light intensity is high. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a typical example of the conventional objective optical      systems for endoscopes using infrared cut filters. In this drawing, the      reference numeral 1 represents an image forming lens, the reference      numeral 2 designates a stop arranged in the image forming lens 1, the      reference numeral 3 denotes a YAG laser light absorption type of cut      filter, the reference numeral 4 represents a YAG light reflection type of      interference filter formed on the incidence surface of the YAG light      absorption type of cut filter, the reference numeral 5 designates an      infrared light absorption type of cut filter, the reference numeral 6      denotes an optical low-pass filter consisting of a quartz plate, etc.      These optical members form an objective optical system A for endoscopes.      The reference numeral 7 represents a solidstate image sensor having a      protective glass 8 bonded to the sensitive surface thereof. The      spectroscopic characteristics of the YAG laser light absorption type of      cut filter 3, YAG laser light reflection type of interference filter 4 and      infrared light absorption type of cut filter 5 are shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  Though the objective optical system A having the formation described above      is capable of eliminating the infrared light almost completely, said      objective optical system A comprises two infrared light absorbing filters      3 and 5 and inevitably has a long total length, thereby making it      impossible to solve the essential problem of compact design of the distal      end demanded for the endoscopes having small diameters. </PAR><PAR>  In the next place, the objective optical system of the type which reduces      the infrared light by reflecting it before attaining to the solid-state      image sensor 7 poses a problem that transmittance is not lowered      sufficiently due to multiple reflections between the filters when two      filters are arranged parallelly and serially in the optical path. Speaking      concretely, the light reflected by the second filter is reflected again by      the first filter arranged before (on the side of incidence) the second      filter, returns again to the second filter and the light partially      transmits the second filter, thereby increasing transmission light      intensity as compared with that in a case where a single filter is used.      Especially, on an assumption that reflection is repeated infinitely      between the two filters, total transmittance of the two filters cannot be      lower than 1/2 of the transmittance of the filter having the lower      transmittance. Accordingly, the objective optical system of this type      cannot eliminate infrared light sufficiently and poses a problem that the      infrared light hinders observation and constitutes danger during      observation. </PAR><PAR>  Though such a problem is not posed, needless to say, when the absorption      type of filters shown in FIG. 1 are used, the absorption type of filters      are lower in durability (affected more easily especially by humidity) than      the interference film filters. When it is obliged to use the interference      film filters or when an endoscope is to be used for medical purposes, it      may therefore be convenient to design an objective lens system as an      oblique view type. As a conventional objective optical system for      endoscopes which deflects the viewing direction by utilizing the      refraction, there is known an objective lens system comprising an      objective optical system A consisting of a prism 9 arranged in the distal      end of an endoscope and an image forming lens 1 and an image guide 10, as      shown in FIG. 3A. Though this arrangement is often adopted when deflection      angle is within 20.degree., the entrance surface of the prism 9 inclines      to the optical axis 0 and its exit surface is perpendicular to the optical      axis. Accordingly, the light entering to the center of visual field or the      center of the entrance end face of the image guide 10, that is, the light      progressing along the optical axis 0 is deflected by a desired angle .phi.      only with the refraction at the entrance surface 9a of the prism 9 as      shown in FIG. 3B. In case of an endoscope using an objective lens system      performing deflection by utilizing the refraction by the surface 9a only      located on the side nearest the object as in the case of this conventional      example, there are posed problems that the distal end of the endoscope      must be inclined and that the inclination angle is too large relative to      the effect obtained by the deflection. Further, there are posed problems      that, when the endoscope is used in water or another medium, the      deflection is reduced remarkably as compared with that in air, thereby      making it impossible to obtain sufficient deflection of viewing direction,      and that the deflecting action produces distortion, astigmatism and      chromatic aberration too grave for the deflection effect since the      deflection is performed by utilizing refraction on a single surface. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A primary object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope      equipped with an oblique view type of objective optical system having a      tip end surface substantially perpendicular to the optical axis, assuring      a minimum reduction of visual field deflection even in water, controlling      distortion, astigmatism, chromatic aberration, etc. produced due to      deflecting action to possible minimum levels respectively, and designed to      assure a sufficient deflection angle of viewing direction. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope equipped      with an objective optical system short in total length thereof, having a      compact design and capable of sufficiently eliminating infrared light. </PAR><PAR>  A still other object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope      equipped with an objective optical system so adapted as to prevent      transmittance to be enhanced by multiple reflections and comprising a      plural number of infrared light cut filters. </PAR><PAR>  The objective optical system according to the present invention is so      adapted as to refract light at least twice for deflecting viewing      direction by arranging obliquely or eccentrically, at least one surface      except the entrance surface (the first surface) of the optical component      closest to an object out of the surfaces of such optical components as      lenses, prisms, etc. to compose said objective optical system, to the      optical axis. In this case, the entrance surface of the optical component      closest to the object may be perpendicular, oblique or eccentric to the      optical axis. Whereby, the deflecting function of said first surface is      lessened and sufficient deflection of viewing direction is obtained though      the distal end surface of the endoscope is substantially perpendicular to      the optical axis. Further, the design makes it possible to minimize the      reduction of the deflection angle in water and aberrations produced by the      deflection. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the objective optical system for endoscopes according to the      present invention comprises a front lens group composed by cementing a      transparent plate to the incident surface of a plano-convex lens and      bonding a stop on the cemented surface, and a rear lens group composed of      a positive lens, at least one of the optical components arranged in said      front and rear lens groups being made of a substance which absorbs the      light having the oscillation frequency of the YAG laser, and interference      films which reflects the light having the oscillation frequency of the YAG      laser being formed on the cemented surfaces of the optical components      arranged in said front and rear lens groups and/or the emerging surface of      said rear lens group. This formation makes it possible to sufficiently      eliminate the infrared light without reserving substantial filter spaces      and design the objective lens system compact by shortening the total      length thereof. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects as well as the features and advantages of the      present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description      of the preferred embodiments when taken in conjunction with the      accompanying drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a sectional view illustrating an example of the formations of the      conventional objective optical systems for endoscopes; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows graphs illustrating the spectroscopic characteristics of the      various types of filters used in the conventional example shown in FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 3A and 3B are sectional views illustrating an example of the      formations of the conventional oblique view type of objective optical      systems for endoscopes; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4A and 4B show sectional views illustrating formation of an      embodiment of the objective optical systems for endoscopes according to      the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a sectional view illustrating the formation wherein a cover glass      is arranged on the object side in the embodiment shown in FIG. 4; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6 through 14 are sectional views illustrating formations of other      embodiments different from one another of the objective optical system      according to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 15 through 21, FIGS. 22A and 22B, FIGS. 23 through 28, FIGS. 29A      through 29C, FIGS. 30A through 30C, FIGS. 31A and 31B, FIGS. 32 through      40, FIGS. 41A and 41B, and FIGS. 42A and 42B are sectional views      illustrating formations of embodiments different from one another of the      objective optical system for endoscopes according to the present invention     . </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Now, the preferred embodiments of the objective optical system according to      the present invention will be detailedly described with reference to the      accompanying drawings wherein the members and parts substantially similar      to those of the conventional examples are represented by the same      reference numerals. </PAR><PAR>  In the first place, the embodiment shown in FIG. 4A is provided with an      objective optical system A consisting of an image forming lens 1 arranged      before (on the object side) an image guide 10 and a deflecting prism 9      arranged before said image forming lens. In this embodiment, the optical      axis of the objective optical system A is coincident with the optical axis      of the image guide 10 as shown in FIG. 4A, and these optical axies will      hereafter be referred to simply as &quot;the optical axis 0&quot; will no      distinguishment. The deflecting prism 9 arranged before the image forming      lens 1 has a surface 9a, on the object side, which is a plane      perpendicular to the optical axis 0 and another surface 9b, on the side of      the image forming lens 1, which is a plane having a normal inclined      relative to the optical axis. The reference numeral 2 represents a stop. </PAR><PAR>  Since this embodiment has the formation described above, the principal ray      l to be incident on the center of the image guide 10 passes along the      optical axis 0 after having passed through the deflecting prism 9 and      angle of incidence of this ray l relative to the optical axis 0 is the      angle of deflection of viewing direction. As shown in FIG. 4B, the ray l      to progress along the optical axis 0 is refracted by the exit surface 9b      of the prism 9 and is obliquely intersected to the entrance surface 9a in      spite of the fact that the surface 9a is perpendicular to the optical      axis, because the exit surface 9b inclines to the optical axis by an angle      of .theta.. As the result, the ray l is also refracted by the entrance      surface 9a to impart a desired angle .phi. of deflection. Further, half      angle of field .omega. determined by the image forming lens 1 is not      varied on the plane perpendicular to the plane including the normal of the      deflecting surface 9b of the prism 9 and the optical axis, but is varied      on the plane including the normal and the optical axis by the refractive      function of the prism 9. When the half angle of field as seen in the      viewing direction on this plane is represented by .omega..sub.d on the      side of the deflection from the optical axis and by .omega..sub.u on the      opposite side, the deviation of .omega..sub.u from .omega. produces      distortion due to deflecting action and, in addition, has relation to      astigmatism, chromatic aberration, etc. produced depending on degree of      the refracting action. As the deviation is larger, aberrations will be      more remarkable. When refractive index n of prism 9 and vertical angle      .theta. of the surface 9b on the side of the image forming lens are      assumed to be 1.883 and 13.42.degree. respectively, relationship between      the half angle of field .omega. before deflection and the half angles of      field .omega..sub.d and .omega..sub.u is as summarized in Table 1 below: </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                         .omega.  20.degree. 30.degree.                                                                               40.degree.                                                                            50.degree.                                .omega..sub.d                                                                           18.77.degree.                                                                             27.17.degree.                                                                            34.70.degree.                                                                         41.03.degree.                             .omega..sub.u                                                                           21.21.degree.                                                                             33.20.degree.                                                                            47.29.degree.                                                                         71.84.degree.                             ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  In this case, the deflection angle of viewing direction .phi. is 12.degree.      in air and a deflection angle of 9.degree. can be reserved even in water      since the refracting surfaces are not located only on the object side      surface of the prism 9. Further, when the lower principal ray is parallel      to the first surface on the object side to form the maximum .omega..sub.d,      .omega. is 50.49.degree. and the optical system is usable up to a maximum      angle of field 2.omega. around 90.degree.. </PAR><PAR>  When the conventional example shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B is assumed to have a      deflection angle of viewing direction of 12.degree. in air, interrelation      among the half angle of field .omega. before deflection, and half angles      of field .omega..sub.u and .omega..sub.d after deflection is summarized as      shown in Table 2. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 2                                                          ______________________________________                                         .omega.    20.degree. 30.degree.  38.degree.                                   .omega..sub.u                                                                             20.28.degree.                                                                             29.57.degree.                                                                              36.57.degree.                                .omega..sub.d                                                                             23.48.degree.                                                                             38.42.degree.                                                                              61.94.degree.                                ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  The prism 9 has a refractive index of 1.883 and the vertical angle is      12.94.degree.. In this case, deflection angle of viewing direction .phi.      is 5.54.degree. in water and the deflection angle of viewing direction in      water is remarkably narrowed since the first surface on the object side      only has refracting function. Further, when the lower principal ray is      parallel to the first surface on the object side to form a maximum      .omega..sub.d, .omega. is 38.13.degree. and the conventional optical      system is usable up to a maximum angle of field 2.omega. of about      60.degree.. As is clear from comparison between Table 1 and Table 2, the      embodiment shown in FIG. 4A which performs refraction twice for deflecting      viewing direction causes smaller the difference between .omega..sub.u and      .omega..sub.d, produces less aberrations due to deflection of viewing      direction and forms better images regardless of the deflection of viewing      direction than the conventional example. As is understood from the      foregoing descriptions, the embodiment shown in FIG. 4A is an objective      optical system for endoscopes comprising an objective lens whose first      surface on the object side is perpendicular to the optical axis, capable      of keeping the reduction of deflection angle of viewing direction to a      minimum in water with no restriction on the form of the distal end of      endoscopes, producing minimum aberrations and having a sufficient      deflection angle of viewing direction. In addition, it is preferable for      obtaining a sufficient deflection angle of viewing direction that the      prism 9 should have a vertical angle .theta. of at least 3.degree. and a      refractive index of at least 1.6. However, too large a vertical angle      .theta. of the prism 9 will make it impossible to obtain a wide half angle      of field .omega. and it should preferably be 45.degree. at maximum. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows an example wherein a cover glass 11 is arranged before the      prism 9 so as to correctly face to the prism 9 under inclined state in the      viewing direction. This example can provide a deflection angle of viewing      direction unvaried even in water since both the surfaces of the cover      glass have no refracting action. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 illustrates a formation of an Embodiment 2 of the present invention.      In this embodiment, the surface on the object side of one lens 13 of two      positive lenses forming the image forming lens 1 is made as a surface      inclined to the optical axis and a prism 12 having an inclined exit      surface is cemented on the inclined surface of the positive lens 13      sandwiching a stop 2 therebetween. Deflection of viewing direction is      obtained by the inclination of the cemented surface 13a and difference in      refractive index between the prism 12 and the lens 13. When refractive      indices of the prism 12 and lens 13 are represented by n.sub.12 and      n.sub.13 respectively, n.sub.12 is smaller than n.sub.13 in the embodiment      shown in FIG. 6, but the viewing direction will be deflected reversely      when n.sub.12 is larger than n.sub.13. This embodiment is characterized in      that it can easily correct chromatic aberration. When Abbe's numbers of      the prism 12 and lens 13 are represented by .nu..sub.12 and .nu..sub.13      respectively, .nu..sub.12 should be smaller than .nu..sub.13 for a      relation of n.sub.12 andlt;n.sub.13 or .nu..sub.12 should be larger than      .nu..sub.13 for a relation of n.sub.12 andgt;n.sub.13. Since the Embodiment 2      requires no spacing tube unlike the Embodiment 1, the former is suited for      use in very this endoscopes for blood vessels. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 illustrates a formation of an Embodiment 3 wherein a cemented      surface serving for deflection of the viewing direction is added to that      in the Embodiment 2 in order to accomplish deflection of viewing      direction. Accordingly, less aberrations are produced in the Embodiment 3.      Further, this embodiment is capable of correcting chromatic aberration      with the cemented surfaces. When refractive indices of the prism 14, prism      15 and lens 16 are represented by n.sub.14, n.sub.15 and n.sub.16      respectively, and Abbe's numbers thereof are designated by .nu..sub.14,      .nu..sub.15 and .nu..sub.16 respectively, .nu..sub.14 andgt;.nu..sub.15      andgt;.nu..sub.16 should be selected for n.sub.14 andgt;n.sub.15 andlt;n.sub.16 or      .nu..sub.14 andlt;.nu..sub.15 andgt;.nu..sub.16 should be selected for n.sub.14      andlt;n.sub.15 andgt;n.sub.16. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 illustrates a formation of an Embodiment 4 of the present invention      wherein a cemented surface 17a inclined relative to the optical axis is      arranged in the vicinity of the imaging surface of the image forming lens      1 and the first surface on the object side is perpendicular to the optical      axis. Accordingly, refraction for deflecting the viewing direction is      performed twice on the first surface on the object side and the cemented      surface. For correcting chromatic aberration in this embodiment,      .nu..sub.17 andgt;.nu..sub.18 should be selected for a relation of n.sub.17      andlt;n.sub.18 or .nu..sub.17 andlt;.nu..sub.18 should be selected for a relation of      n.sub.17 andlt;n.sub.18 when refractive indices of the lens 17 and prism 18 are      represented by n.sub.17 and n.sub.18 respectively, and Abbe's numbers      thereof are designated by .nu..sub.17 and .nu..sub.18 respectively. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows a formation of an Embodiment 5 of the present invention so      adapted as to perform deflection of the viewing direction by placing a      negative lens 19 arranged on the extreme object side in,the image forming      lens 1 at a position eccentric or decentered by .delta.. In this      embodiment, the light to progress along the optical axis 0 will pass      through the lens 19 in a position out of the optical axis 0' of the lens      19. Therefore, though the entrance surface of the lens 19 is perpendicular      to the optical axis 0, the light is refracted respectively at the entrance      and exit surfaces of the lens 19, that is, deflection is performed by      twice refraction. The curved surface to be placed at the eccentric      position is not limited to a concave surface as adopted in this      embodiment, but may be a convex surface as shown in the chain line or an      aspherical surface as shown in the two-point chain line. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 shows an Embodiment 6 of the present invention wherein the lens      component arranged at the position eccentric or decentered by .delta. is      designed as a cemented doublet 20. When refractive indices of the lens 21      and lens 22 are represented by n.sub.21 and n.sub.22 respectively,      n.sub.21 is larger than n.sub.22 and the cemented surface is designed as a      convex surface. </PAR><PAR>  When the cemented doublet to be placed at the eccentric position is a      convex lens as shown in the chain lines, the cemented surface should be      designed as a concave surface. In this embodiment, only the image side      concave surface 22a of the lens 20 may be placed at an eccentric position      as indicated by .delta. in FIG. 7. In other words, the cemented surface      21a may or may not be eccentric. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 illustrates an Embodiment 7 of the present invention wherein the      viewing direction deflecting means of the afore-mentioned Embodiment 5 is      applied to an objective optical system of a non-flexible endoscope.      Speaking concretely, a front lens 19 of the objective optical system 1 is      eccentric or decentered from the optical axis and a cemented doublet 24      having a cemented surface 24a eccentric or decentered by .DELTA. from the      optical axis is arranged after (on the image side) a relay optical system      of the non-flexible endoscope. This embodiment is capable of correcting      aberrations produced due to deflection of the viewing direction in the      objective optical system by utilizing the high curvature on the cemented      surface of the eccentric lens component 24. Further, aberrations can be      corrected more favorably by adopting an aspherical surface on the cemented      doublet 24. Moreover, this embodiment is capable of correcting aberrations      sufficiently with no restriction on outside diameter of the lens arranged      in the distal end of the non-flexible endoscope by arranging the      aberration correcting lens component 24 after (on the image side) the      relay optical system 23. In addition, axially symmetrical aspherical      surfaces may be used in the non eccentric optical system, for example, on      the objective optical system 1, relay lens system 23 and eyepiece 25. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 shows an Embodiment 8 of the present invention wherein the first      surface 9a of the prism 9 used in the first embodiment shown in FIG. 4A is      designed as an aspherical surface which is not axially symmetrical.      Speaking concretely, the prism 26 shown in FIG. 12 has an aspherical      surface 26a. The first surface 26a located on the object side is designed      as an aspherical surface so as not to increase refractive action abruptly      at the periphery of the visual field, thereby preventing aberrations from      being produced by the deflection of the viewing direction. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 shows an Embodiment 9 of the present invention wherein the first      surface located on the object side in the fifth embodiment shown in FIG. 9      is designed as an aspherical surface for the same reason for the      Embodiment 8, and the prism 27 has an aspherical surface 27a which is not      axially symmetrical. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiments 8 and 9 (shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 respectively) adopt, as      described above, the aspherical first surfaces located on the object side      which are not axially symmetrical. These aspherical surfaces have such a      shape that a portion near the optical axis is perpendicular to the optical      axis, positive curvature is higher at portions closer to the periphery on      the deflecting side, i.e., on the lower side in the drawings, whereas      negative curvature is higher at portions closer to the periphery on the      opposite side, i.e., on the upper side in the drawings. Such a design      weakens the refractive action on the principal ray at the periphery of the      visual field by the first surfaces located on the object side. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 illustrates an Embodiment 10 of the present invention wherein a      surface other than the first surface located on the object side used in      the fifth embodiment shown in FIG. 9 is designed as an aspherical surface      which is not axially symmetrical. Also in the Embodiment 10, the      aspherical surface which is not axially symmetrical can prevent      aberrations from being produced by the deflection of the viewing      direction. In the Embodiment 10 shown in FIG. 14, the surface of the      objective optical system 1 nearest the image guide 10 is designed as an      aspherical surface. In addition to the curvature as that of the final      surface of the objective optical system, positive curvature is increased      at peripherical portions through which peripherical principal ray passes      on the deflection side (upper side in the drawing), whereas negative      curvature is increased at the peripherical portions, whereby aberrations      are corrected and prevented from being produced due to deflection of the      viewing direction by producing aberrations which are not axially      symmetrical and reverse to the axially asymmetrical aberrations produced      by the eccentric or decentered concave lens (the lens located on the      extreme object side) 19. </PAR><PAR>  As is understood from the foregoing descriptions, the objective optical      system for endoscopes according to the present invention has a simple      formation, comprises a leading and surface substantially perpendicular to      the optical axis, assures little reduction of deflection of the viewing      direction, produces little aberration due to the deflection of the viewing      direction owing to twice or more refractions for deflection of the viewing      direction, and provides a sufficient deflection angle of viewing      direction. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 shows an Embodiment 11 of the present invention wherein an      objective optical system in which means for cutting the infrared light is      added to the objective optical system A shown in FIG. 6 is combined with a      solid-state image sensor. In this embodiment, the reference numeral 28      designates a deflecting prism made of a substance absorbing the YAG laser      light and also functioning as a YAG laser light cut filter. Before the      inclines exit surface of this prism 28 is cemented to alens 29      corresponding to the front lens 13 of the image forming lens 1 in the      embodiment shown in FIG. 6. On the exit side of the lens 29 is arranged a      lens 30 corresponding to the rear side lens 13' in the embodiment shown in      FIG. 6 and an infrared light absorption type of cut filter 31 having a      multi-layer interference film 32, 33 reflecting the YAG laser light on      each of the entrance and exit surfaces thereof. The lens 30 and the filter      31 are cemented to each other and a protective glass provided before the      surface of a solid-state image sensor 34 is cemented to the exit surface      of the filter 31. In addition, spectroscopic characteristics of the YAG      laser light absorption type of cut filter 28, YAG laser light reflection      type of interference films 32 and 33, and infrared light absorption type      of cut filter 31 are the same as those of the filters 3, 4 and 5      respectively shown in FIG. 2. This embodiment is capable of sufficiently      eliminating infrared light without substantial filter space since at least      one of the optical components in the front group and rear group of the      objective optical system is made of a substance absorbing the light having      the oscillation frequency of the YAG laser, and interference films      reflecting the light having the oscillation frequency of the YAG laser are      formed on the cemented surfaces in the front group and rear group and/or      the emerging surface in the rear group. Further, the objective optical      system is of a compact type as described above. Accordingly, the objective      optical system has a short total length and a small outside diameter, and      is therefore especially suited for use in endoscopes having small      diameters. Furthermore, since the visual sensitivity adjusting infrared      absorption type of filter 31 is arranged after the convexo-plane lens 30      used as the rear lens component, i.e., at the position where the principal      ray is parallel to the optical axis, this embodiment has an effect to      uniformalize color within the visual field. Moreover, since the YAG laser      light reflection type of interference films 32 and 33 are formed on both      the front and rear surfaces of the infrared light absorption type of cut      filter 31, the embodiment has an effect that the lights reflected by the      films 32 and 33 are absorbed by the filter 31, thereby preventing flare      and ghost light from being produced. In addition, the position of the YAG      laser light absorption type of cut prism 28 may be replaced with that of      the infrared light absorption type of cut filter 31 in this embodiment. If      YAG laser light cut ratio is too low, both the lenses 29 and 30 may be      made of substances absorbing the YAG laser light with no influence in the      visible range. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 illustrates an Embodiment 12 of the present invention wherein the      reference numeral 36 represents a prism made of a substance absorbing the      infrared light, and the reference numeral 37 designates a YAG laser light      reflection type of interference filter fitted into the aperture formed by      the stop 2 arranged on the cemented surface between the prism 36 and the      lens 29. The reference numeral 38 denotes an optical low-pass filter      consisting of crystal plate, etc. cemented to the emerging surface of the      convexoplane lens 30, and the reference numeral 39 represents a YAG laser      light reflection type of interference filter formed on the cemented      surface between the convexo-plane lens 30 and the optical low-pass filter      38. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 shows an Embodiment 13 of the present invention wherein      radial-gradient refractive index lenses (radial-GRIN lenses) 40 and 41 in      which the refractive index is varied from their center portions to their      peripheral portions respectively are used in place of the lenses 29 and 30      in the embodiment shown in FIG. 15. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 18 illustrates an Embodiment 14 of the present invention wherein the      entire objective optical system is composed of a single group by cementing      an infrared light absorption type of cut prism 36 to the incident surface      of the radial-GRIN lens 40, and arranging the stop 2 and YAG laser light      reflection type of interference filter 37 on the cemented surface. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 19 shows an Embodiment 15 of the present invention which is composed      by arranging an optical low-pass filter 38 between the radial-GRIN lens 40      and the protective glass plate 35 for the solid-state image sensor 34 in      the embodiment shown in FIG. 18. </PAR><PAR>  In the Embodiments 13 to 15 described above wherein all the surfaces of the      optical elements are plane, the YAG laser light reflection type of      interference filter may be arranged on any surface, except for the one      which is located on the extreme object side. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, since it is possible to preliminarily eliminate infrared light      from the illumination light when a dark place is to be illuminated with a      self illumination as in the case of an endoscope, the infrared light      absorption type of filter may be unnecessary. In such a case, however, it      is necessary to arrange a YAG laser light cut filter at a place in contact      with the YAG laser light reflection type of interference filter. Further,      it is advantageous from the viewpoint of space to design the protective      glass plate for the solid-state image sensor as a YAG laser light      absorption type of cut filter and to arrange the YAG laser light      reflection type of interference filter on the surface of the protective      glass plate. Moreover, set position of the solid-state image sensor can be      properly adjusted in the Embodiments 11 through 15 by displacing the rear      group to which the solid-state image sensor has preliminarily been      cemented or displacing only the solid-state image sensor relative to the      front and rear groups which have preliminarily been fixed. In these      embodiments, infrared light is eliminated efficiently by the objective      optical systems having short total lengths and small diameters. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 20 illustrates an Embodiment 16 of the present invention wherein the      reference numeral 41 represents two infrared light cut filters which are      composed by evaporationcoating infrared light cutting interference films      42 to sides of plane parallel plates, etc., and arranged in mutually      inclined positions between the image forming lens 1 and the image sensor      34. Since the filters 41 are inclined toward each other as described      above, the light reflected by the interference film 42 of the second      filter 41 is incident on the interference film 42 of the first filter 41      at an angle larger than 0 and accordingly goes out of the optical path      rather early without multiple reflections, thereby preventing      transmittance from being enhanced. When transmittance of the interference      film 42 is represented by .tau., the objective optical system has      transmittance of .tau..sup.2 as a whole and exhibits a high effect for      cutting the YAG laser light. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 21 illustrates an Embodiment 17 of the present invention wherein an      infrared light cutting interference film 42 is evaporation-coated on the      incident surface or emerging surface of a prism 43 (having a surface      perpendicular to the optical axis and a surface not perpendicular to the      optical axis) in the objective optical system A for oblique view. This      embodiment has merits of simple formation and narrow space to be occupied,      since it requires only evaporation-coating of the infrared light cutting      interference film 42 to the entrance surface or exit surface of the prism      43. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 22A shows an Embodiment 18 of the present invention wherein a lens 45      is arranged between a composite filter 44 and an infrared light cut filter      41, said composite filter being composed by sandwiching and cementing an      infrared light absorbing filter 44c between a plane parallel plate 44a      having a front surface evaporation-coated with an infrared light cutting      interference film 42 and a plane parallel plate 44b having a rear surface      coated with multiple layers, whereas said infrared light cut filter being      arranged before the solid-state image sensor 34 and composed by      evaporation-coating the front surface thereof with an interference film      42. In this embodiment wherein the light reflected by the interference      film 42 of the filter 41 is incident on the filter 44 at an angle larger      than 0 owing to the function of the lens 45 though the filters 44 and 41      are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the optical axis, said      reflection light goese out of the optical path rather early withou      multiple reflections, thereby preventing transmittance from being      enhanced. Further, since this embodiment comprises the infrared light      absorbing filter 44c between the two interference films 42, it is capable      of eliminating infrared light more effectively owing to the infrared light      absorption by the infrared light absorbing filter 44c. Furthermore, when      the infrared light absorbing filter is used in combination with the      infrared light cutting interference filter as described above, it is      possible to obtain an optical system having high color reproducibility by      utilizing the transmittance characteristics of the respective filters.      Shown in FIG. 22B are spectroscopic characteristic curves a, b and c of      the interference film 42, the infrared absorbing filter 44c and the      composite filter 44 composed of a combination thereof. By selecting the      infrared light cut wavelengths .lambda..sub.a and .lambda..sub.b indicated      on the characteristic curves a and b so as to obtain a relation of      .lambda..sub.a .ltoreq..lambda..sub.b, color reproducibility is improved      since transmittance varies gradually at wavelengths shorter than      .lambda..sub.a and abruptly at wavelengths longer than .lambda..sub.a. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 23 illustrates an Embodiment 19 of the present invention wherein in      the objective optical system A, two infrared light cut filters 41 are      arranged on both the sides of a lens 46 which is composed by cementing a      lens-like infrared light absorbing filter 46a between two lenses 46b and      46c, and by coating the side surfaces thereof with a black paint 46d. This      embodiment has the same effect as the embodiment shown in FIG. 22A and, in      addition, the merit of the cemented lens which is capable of correcting      coma, spherical aberration, chromatic aberration, etc. at the same time. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 24 shows an Embodiment 20 of the present invention wherein, in the      objective optical system A, arranged before a lens 45 is a composite      filter 47 which is composed by sandwiching and cementing an infrared light      absorbing filter 47c between a plane parallel plate 47a having an      interference film 42 evaporation-coated to the front surface thereof and a      plane parallel plate 47b having an interference film 42 evaporation-coated      to the rear surface thereof, and coating the side surfaces thereof with a      black paint 47d. In this embodiment, the multiple reflection is prevented      by absorbing the YAG laser light with the infrared light absorbing filter      47c arranged between both the interference films 42. Though it is      preferable for the infrared light absorbing filter 47c to have      transmittance below 30%, the transmittance is ordinarily set on the order      of 10% so as not to lower transmittance for the visible light excessively      since transmittance for the visible light is generally lowered by lowering      transmittance for the infrared light. This embodiment provides a merit to      allow to design the composite filter compact. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 25 illustrates an Embodiment 21 of the present invention wherein the      composite filter 47 is arranged between the lens 45 and the solid-state      image sensor 34 unlike the Embodiment 20 described above. In case of the      Embodiment 21 wherein angle of incidence is apt to be large on the      interference film 42 due to the function of the lens 45 and the infrared      light cutting efficiency of the interference film 42 varies depending on      angle of incidence, it is necessary to design the optical system so as to      obtain a predetermined angle of incidence, and it is ordinarily set at      30.degree. or narrower. This embodiment also has a merit to allow to      design the composite filter compact. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 26 shows an Embodiment 22 of the present invention wherein arranged in      the front most section of the objective optical system A is a composite      filter 48 which is composed by cementing an infrared light absorbing      filter 48 having smaller diameter between a plane parallel plate 48a and a      plano-convex lens 48b, and by coating the side surfaces thereof with a      black paint 48d. Since this embodiment comprises the infrared light      absorbing filter 48c having a diameter smaller than those of the plane      parallel plate 48a and the plano-convex lens 48b, it permits thickening      the black paint 48d and has a high moisture-preventive effect. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 27 illustrates an Embodiment 23 of the present invention wherein      arranged in the objective optical system A is a filter 49 which is      composed by attaching cover glass plates 49b and 49c to both surfaces of      an infrared light absorbing glass plate 49a, fitting a metallic protective      frame 49d so as to cover at least the circumferential surface of the      infrared light absorbing glass plate 49a, and charging the corners formed      between the end surfaces of said protective frame 49d and cover glass      plates 49b and 49c with a filling material 49e having low hygroscopicity.      This embodiment has merits that moisture resistance of the infrared light      absorbing glass plate 49a is enhanced by the metallic protective frame      49d, and that the filling material can easily be charged and enhances      working efficiency. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 28 shows an Embodiment 24 of the present invention wherein the      objective optical system A as a whole including a filter 50 composed by      attaching cover glass plates 50b and 50c to both surfaces of an infrared      light absorbing glass plate 50a is fixed in a metallic lens frame 51, and      a filling material 54 is charged between the frontmost lens 52 and lens      frame 51 and between the rearmost lens 53 and the lens frame 51      respectively. The embodiment has merits that moisture resistance of the      infrared light absorbing glass plate 50a is enhanced and that outside      diameter of the optical system is not enlarged. In addition, the cover      glass plates 50b and 50c may or may not be attached. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 29A through 29C illustrates an Embodiment 25 of the present      invention. FIG. 29A shows a general view, FIG. 29B presents a side view of      main parts on an enlarged scale and FIG. 29C illustrates a sectional view      taken along the C--C line in FIG. 29B. Arranged in the objective optical      system A is a composite filter 55 which is composed by fitting an infrared      light absorbing filter 55d between a crystal filter 55a for eliminating      Moire, false color, etc and prisms 55b and 55c for enabling oblique      arrangement of the solid-state image sensor 34, bonding the cementing      surfaces thereof with an optical bonding agent and coating the      circumferential surfaces thereof entirely with a moisture preventive paint      55e. Though the infrared light absorbing filter 55d has high moisture      resistance in this embodiment, a higher moisture preventive effect can be      obtained by mixing a small amount of moisture absorbing agent in the      optical bonding agent so that moisture remaining on the surfaces of the      optical components at the bonding stage is absorbed by the moisture      absorbing agent. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 30A through 30C illustrates an Embodiment 26 of the present      invention. FIG. 30A shows a general view, FIG. 30B presents a sectional      view of main parts on an enlarged scale and FIG. 30C illustrates a      sectional view taken along the C--C line in FIG. 30B. Arranged in the      objective optical system A is a cover glass member 56 which is composed by      fitting an infrared light absorbing filter 56c between optical glass      plates 56a and 56b, bonding the cementing surfaces thereof with an optical      bonding agent, coating all the circumferential surfaces thereof with a      moisture preventing paint 56d, surrounding the entire circumference of      said cover glass member 56 with a frame 56e and bonding said frame to said      cover glass member. Though the infrared light absorbing filter 56c has      high moisture resistance also in this embodiment, a higher moisture      preventive effect can be obtained by mixing a moisture absorbing agent in      the optical bonding agent in the same manner as in the Embodiment 29. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 31A and 31B show an Embodiment 27 of the present invention. FIG. 31A      illustrates a sectional view of main members and FIG. 31B shows a      sectional view taken along the B--B line in FIG. 31A. This embodiment      shows a example modified the moisture resistance structure of the infrared      light absorbing filter 56c in the Embodiment 26, and FIG. 31A corresponds      to FIG. 30B and FIG. 31B to FIG. 30C respectively. That is, this      embodiment is so adapted as to eliminate moisture penetrating between the      cover glass member 56 and the frame 56e and provides improved moisture      resistance by forming a plural number of holes in the outer circumference      of the frame 56e, filling the holes with a moisture absorbing agent 56f,      surrounding the frame 56e with a pipe 56g and bonding said pipe to said      frame. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 32 shows an Embodiment 28 of the present invention wherein arranged in      the objective optical system A for oblique view shown in FIG. 21 is a      composite filter 57 which is composed by fitting an infrared light      absorbing filter 57c between prisms 57a and 57b, bonding the cementing      surfaces thereof with an optical bonding agent and coating the side      surfaces thereof with a moisture preventive agent 57d. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 33 illustrates an embodiment 29 of the present invention wherein      arranged in an objective optical system for side view (not shown) is a      composite filter 58 which is composed by fitting an infrared light      absorbing filter 58c between a prism 58a and a glass plate 58b, bonding      the cementing surfaces thereof with an optical bonding agent and coating      the side surfaces thereof with a moisture preventive agent 58d. This      embodiment has a merit that the infrared light absorbing filter 58c can be      half as thick as the ordinary infrared light absorbing filter since      infrared light passes twice through the infrared light absorbing filter      58c at each of the incidence and reflection stages. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 34 shows an Embodiment 30 of the present invention as an applicational      example of the embodiment shown in FIG. 33. In this embodiment, a moisture      preventive structure is composed by arranging a reflection layer 58d  in      place of the glass plate 58b used in the embodiment of FIG. 33. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 35 illustrates an Embodiment 31 of the present invention wherein      arranged in the objective optical system A is a composite filter 59 which      is composed by bonding a cover glass plate 59b to the front surface of an      infrared light absorbing filter 59a, bonding an interference film 59c to      the rear surface of said infrared light absorbing filter and coating the      circumferential surface thereof with a moisturepreventive paint 59d. This      embodiment provides enhanced moisture resistance since the interference      film 59c has layers in a number larger than that of the ordinary multiple      coats. Further, this embodiment is advantageous for preventing flare since      the light reflected by the interference film 59c is absorbed by the      infrared light absorbing filter 59a. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 36 illustrated an Embodiment 32 of the present invention wherein said      composite filter 59 is arranged in the direction opposite to that in the      embodiment shown in FIG. 35 in the objective optical system A for an      electronic endoscope using a solid-state image sensor equipped with an      interference film type of mosaic filter 34a. This embodiment is      advantageous for preventing flare since the light reflected by the surface      of the mosaic filter 34a is absorbed by the infrared light absorbing      filter 59a. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 37 shows an Embodiment 33 of the present invention wherein arranged in      the objective optical system A is a cemented lens component 60 which is      composed by sandwiching and cementing an infrared light absorbing filter      60c between lenses 60a and 60b having small diameters, and coating the      circumferential surfaces thereof with a moisture preventive paint 60d.      This embodiment has a merit to enhance moisture resistance of the infrared      light absorbing filter 60c since the lenses 60a and 60b have small      diameters and allow to coat the moisture preventive paint in a large      amount. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 38 shows an Embodiment 34 of the present invention wherein arranged in      an objective optical system (not shown) is a filter 61 which is composed      by sandwiching and cementing an infrared light absorbing filter 61c      between cover glass plates 61a and 61b having different diameters, and      coating the circumferential surfaces thereof with a moisture preventing      agent 61d. This embodiment has a merit that the light cannot be eclipsed      even when it is high since the cover glass plate 61b has a diameter larger      than that of the cover glass plate 61a. Further, when a frame 61e is used      for holding the filter 61 as shown in the drawing, it holds only the      surface of the cover glass plate 61b having the larger diameter while      avoiding the circumferential surface of the moisture preventive agent      having indefinite diameter, thereby minimizing inclination or eccentricity      of the filter 61 and assuring high manufacturing precision. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 39 illustrates an Embodiment 35 of the present invention arranged in a      lens system for a non-flexible endoscope is a filter 62 which is composed      by sandwiching and cementing an infrared light absorbing filter 62c      between lenses 62a and 62b, and costing the circumferences thereof with a      moisture preventive agent 62d. In addition, moisture can be further      enhanced by fixing a frame around the circumferential surface of the      filter 62. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 40 illustrates an Embodiment 36 of the present ivention wherein an      interference film 19a is coated on the front surface of the frontmost lens      19. Owing to the interference film 19a formed on the frontmost surface in      the optical system, this embodiment comprises few members reflecting light      before the interference film 19a and has a merit to minimize multiple      reflections. However, this embodiment is suited for cases where difference      in angle of incidence is small or the interference film 19a can hardly be      injured. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 41A and 41B show an Embodiment 37 of the present invention. FIG. 41A      illustrates a general view and FIG. 41B is a graph visualizing      spectroscopic transmittance characteristic of the infrared light cut      filter used in this embodiment. In an electronic endoscope equipped, in      addition to YAG laser, with a laser source emitting He-Ne laser light for      using the He-Ne laser as the guide light for the YAG laser, this      embodiment arranges, in the objective optical system A, an infrared light      cut filter 64 composed by evaporationcoating a plane parallel plate, etc.      with an interference film 64a. In this case, spectroscopic transmittance      characteristic of the infrared light cut filter can be optimized as      follows. In order to make the He-Ne laser light (having a wavelength of      632.8 nm) visible, it is sufficient to design the infrared light cut      filter 64 so as to have transmittance higher than 0.1% at the wavelength      or satisfy .tau..sub.632.8 andgt;0.1%. For practical use, however, the lower      limit should be set at about 10% and the infrared light cut filter should      be designed so as to satisfy .tau..sub.632.8 andgt;10%. From another viewpoint,      when the infrared light cut filter is designed so as to have transmittance      of 50% at a wavelength longer than 610 nm or satisfy .lambda..sub.50 andgt;610      nm, it should have almost satisfactory transmittance (0.1%) at 632.8 nm.      In this case, however, the infrared light cut filter satisfying      .lambda..sub.50 andgt;610 nm is not perfectly free from the fear of too low      transmittance at .lambda.andequals;632.8 nm when transmittance errors of individual      filters are taken into consideration. Therefore, the He-Ne laser light is      clearly visibly by designing the infrared light cut filter so as to      satisfy .lambda..sub.50 andgt;632.8 nm or 640 nm, i.e. have transmittance of      50% at 632.8 nm. However, the infrared light cut filter should be designed      so as to satisfy also 700 nmandgt;.lambda..sub.50 or more preferably 670 nm      .sub..apprxeq..sup.andgt;  .lambda..sub.50 since too long .lambda..sub.50 will      lower infrared light cutting efficiently and degrade color reproducibility      for TV cameras. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 42A and 42B show an Embodiment 38 of the present invention which is      so adapted as to allow easy attachment and detachment of an infrared light      absorbing filter so that it can be replaced when its characteristic is      degraded. FIG. 42A shows an infrared light absorbing filter 67 held in a      threaded frame 66 and detachably screwed in an adapter for an endoscope      which is externally equipped with a TV camera 64 In this case, it is      possible to arrange a plural number of infrared light absorbing filters in      a turret so that a deteriorated filter can be switched to another by      turning the turret Further, FIG. 42B illustrates an infrared light      absorbing filter 69 integral with a cover glass plate 68 detachably      screwed in a distal end of an endoscope, especially in an industrial      electronic endoscope. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is, needless to say, applicable to the cases where      electronic endoscopes are equipped not only with infrared light cut      filters, but also color temperature varying filters, double refraction      filters and/or low-pass filters Further, the present invention is      applicable also for cutting not only the YAG laser light, but also other      types of lasers used as non-observation light and non-guide light. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
