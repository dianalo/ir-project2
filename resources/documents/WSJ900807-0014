Some oil analysts turned cautious, suggesting prices maybe near their peaks after the run-up of more than $10 abarrel in recent weeks. But most said that if Middle Easttensions continued to escalate, prices could still go farhigher to close in on the records of the early 1980s of $30to $40 a barrel.   &quot;It's a free-for-all,&quot; said Michael Rothman, vicepresident and a senior energy analyst at Merrill LynchCapital Markets. &quot;People are concerned not only about theloss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil but fear that Saudi Arabia'sproduction may also be in jeopardy.&quot;   Global sanctions continued to tighten against PresidentSaddam Hussein of Iraq. An embargo threatened to choke offfrom world oil supplies some four million barrels a day ofcrude oil and petroleum products that Iraq and Kuwait hadbeen exporting.   While industry officials were skeptical that all the oilflowing from Iraq and Kuwait could be cut off, there wereindications yesterday that the embargo had begun to work.Because some of the tankers that were to pick up Iraqi oil atthe Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey, sailed away afterthe embargo began, Iraq stopped pumping crude through one ofits pipelines there. It also reduced the flow of oil throughanother pipeline across Turkey.   These developments, combined with the rapid rise in oilprices, also pushed the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries further into disarray. Over the weekend, some ofthe OPEC oil ministers had indicated they might hold anemergency session to try to take steps to slow the run-up inoil prices.   The idea would be for some of those with spare producingcapacity to begin producing above the quotas that have beenso controversial until oil prices began rising. And some ofthe countries that want a more moderate approach to pricingto protect their market shares of the future are understoodto have begun stepping up their output.   Yesterday, however, OPEC's Vienna headquarters reportedthat it hadn't been advised of any requests for an emergencymeeting. &quot;OPEC is not doing anything,&quot; an official said,&quot;except to wait and see.&quot;   Several oil ministers called, meanwhile, for adherence tothe production quotas that were re-established last month.The July agreement had set a ceiling of 22.5 million barrelsa day for total OPEC production and brought the United ArabEmirates, a chronic overproducer, back into the fold with ahigher quota.   It's generally assumed the July agreement was nullified bythe fact that one Persian Gulf member of OPEC, Iraq, invadedand occupied another gulf member, Kuwait. But Mana SaidOtaiba, the Emirates' oil minister, was among severalministers yesterday urging continued compliance with theagreement. He sent a message to Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oilminister and OPEC president, calling on all member states notto exceed their quotas &quot;under the current circumstances inthe {Persian Gulf} region.&quot;   Immediate oil shortages aren't expected even if Iraqi andKuwaiti crudes are cut off completely by embargoes or byblockades. J. Robinson West, president of Petroleum FinanceCo., noted that world oil inventories are at a nine-year highand that demand for OPEC oil is less than the 22.5 millionbarrels a day allowed under the production ceiling. But hesuggested major differences between the &quot;actual structure ofthe market and the psychology of the market.&quot;   Whether warranted or not, oil prices leaped record amountsyesterday. Some U.S. oil companies increased their fieldpostings, what their refineries are paying, for West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark crude, by a record $3.50 a barrelto $26.50. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futuresprice of a WTI-like crude for September delivery jumped arecord $3.56 to settle at $28.05 a barrel.   &quot;What was a surplus in oil inventories only a week agosuddenly is considered balance today,&quot; said William H. BrownIII, international oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.   According to studies by Mr. Brown, a two-month disruptionin Iraq and Kuwait exports would carry WTI to a new peak of$29 a barrel even if other nations such as Saudi Arabiaproduce more oil to fill the gap. If others in OPEC don't tryto make up the lost supplies, &quot;you are talking $37 plus forWTI,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
