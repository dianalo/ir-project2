After meeting in emergency session, Kuwait's National Council,or Parliament, issued a statement rejecting what it called theIraqi ``policy of violence, threats and blackmail.''   It was the latest instance of bellicose behavior by IraqiPresident Saddam Hussein, although until now his muscle-flexing hasbeen aimed mainly at Israel and its chief ally, the United States.   The accusations also represent a dramatic escalation inBaghdad's campaign against fellow members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries who violate production quotas.   OPEC, beset by disputes over production levels and prices, opensits mid-year meeting in Geneva next Thursday.   The collapse of oil prices, blamed largely on overproduction,has cost Iraq billions of dollars in lost revenue at a time when itwas involved in the costly 1980-88 Persian Gulf war with Iran.   Kuwait, which was one of Iraq's staunchest allies in that war,called the emergency legislative session to discuss the Iraqiaccusations, and quickly began a diplomatic offensive. Iraq andKuwait have long disagreed over their border.   Iraq's foreign minister, Tareq Aziz, claimed Kuwait had drilledoil wells in Iraq's southern Rumaila field and pumped oil worth$2.4 billion out of it since 1980. He said Baghdad expects Kuwaitto pay it back.   ``We showed patience and prudence,'' Aziz said in a letter toArab League Secretary-General Chadli Klibi, which was read overofficial Baghdad Radio and on state television. ``But things havedeveloped to a level which we can no longer ignore.''   The Iraqi foreign minister renewed Iraq's accusations ofoverproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates and said suchactions were tantamount to ``military aggression against Iraq.''   ``The attempts by the governments of Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates to flood the oil market ... is a premeditated anddeliberate plan to weaken Iraq and undermine its economy andsecurity,'' he declared.   On Tuesday, Saddam threatened to retaliate against Kuwait andthe U.A.E. with force if necessary for quota violations. Iraq has a1 million-man army. Kuwait, with only 1.7 million residents, has20,300 members of the armed forces.   In Kuwait City, the emirate's capital, the 75-member NationalCouncil legislature was called into closed-door session to discussthe Iraqi allegation.   In its statement, the interim Parliament, formed earlier thismonth, said Iraq should abide ``by the style of consultation,understanding and conducting dialogue ... before hastening tospread charges against Kuwait, or attempting to cast doubt onKuwait's national and humanitarian stands.''   The statement recalled that Kuwait had suffered at the hands ofIranian-backed terrorists for its support of Iraq in the Gulf War.   Later, Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed, flew toSaudi Arabia, carrying a message for King Fahd. He also planned tovisit other members of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council thatgroups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the UnitedArab Emirates, the official Kuwait news agency reported.   Two other government ministers were dispatched to 12 other ArabLeague countries, including Egypt, Syria, Libya and Jordan, thenews agency said.   It said Kuwait had begn a ``wide-scale campaign on the Arablevel to explain its viewpoint on the Iraqi complaint against it.''   Gulf diplomatic sources, insisiting on anonymity, said SaudiArabia was considering summoning the Gulf Cooperation Council to anemergency meeting over the issue.   The sources said King Fahd had conferred by telephone withKuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, late Wednesday. Fahdwas expected to lead efforts to defuse tensions.   Overproduction has helped drive prices down from the OPECbenchmark of $18 a barrel to below $14 in recent weeks.   Kuwait's quota is 1.5 million barrels a day, but it has beenproducing as much as 1.9 million barrels daily. The U.A.E. hasproduced up to 2.1 million barrels a day in recent months, morethan double its daily quota of 1.09 million barrels.   Iraq, with oil reserves estimated at 110 billion barrels, wantsto eventually double its own production capacity to 7 millionbarrels a day and push prices up to the $25 level.   Saddam said Tuesday Iraq had lost $14 billion because of theprice slump. Iraq's foreign debt is estimated at $60 billion to $70billion.   In recent months, Saddam has been stridently critical of theUnited States and its allies for what he perceives as a concertedcampaign to curb his effort to build an arsenal of high-technologyweapons, including long-range missiles.   He claimed in April that Iraq has binary chemical weapons andthreatened to use them against Israel if it tried to attack Iraq.   Iraq and Kuwait have never agreed on the demarcation of their80-mile border since Kuwait gained its independence from Britain in1961. At the time, the Iraqi government of Gen. Abdul Karim Kassemrefused to recognize Kuwait and the emirate called in Britishtroops for protection.   Kassem was deposed in a February 1963 coup by the Baath ArabSocialist Party, which insisted Kuwait was part of Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
