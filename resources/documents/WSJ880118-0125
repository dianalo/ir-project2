At the same time, officials said, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would be required to share with private industry more-mundane tasks, such as launching commercial satellites or conducting industrial experiments in an orbiting space station.    &quot;The government will do the basic science and advanced research,&quot; an administration official said, &quot;and it will turn to the private sector for routine operations.&quot;    The twin decisions come out of long reviews by the Economic Policy Council, the National Security Council and NASA. The space agency has been battling the White House and Commerce Department over its mission, arguing that it should control even routine space tasks. President Reagan is expected to mention his new space policy in his State of the Union address next Monday and include specific recommendations in the legislative package accompanying the speech.    The Reagan administration plans to ask Congress to approve $100 million in spending in fiscal 1989, which starts Oct. 1, to launch the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; program for new space technologies, officials said. Details of the program first were reported in Aviation Week andamp; Space Technology magazine. Funding for the program would rise over the following four years to about $200 million annually in fiscal 1992 and 1993, they said.    Among the new technologies to be explored in Pathfinder are new ways of propelling and slowing space vehicles. Scientists also would explore the effects of gravity during long missions. If the new technologies succeed, administration officials said, the U.S. may plan missions to the moon or Mars.    But administration officials played down the prospects of manned exploration, claiming that NASA was pushing the president to adopt grandiose goals to increase the space agency's power and budget. NASA wouldn't comment.    As previously reported, the administration is expected to ask Congress for about $11 billion for NASA for fiscal 1989. NASA Administrator James Fletcher has appealed budget cuts proposed by the White House budget office for a large new X-ray telescope spacecraft called the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility. </TEXT></DOC>
