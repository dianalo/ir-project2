But many, if not most, IFC loans go to government-controlled enterprises and the IFC has a growing enthusiasm for investing in Communist countries.    According to Sir William Ryrie, the IFC's chief executive officer under titular head Barber Conable, &quot;The main initiative and drive and the bulk of the capital required {for IFC investments} must come from the private sector.&quot; Yet, the IFC invested $17 million in an automobile plant in China in 1985 where the only private-sector involvement was a stake of less than 10% held by Peugeot. Private foreign investment in China has nosedived in very recent years due to increased Chinese government restrictions on foreign investors. Yet, according to Toerstein Stephansen, director of the IFC's Asian/Pacific branch, &quot;Money is available and we can, each year, provide up to $100 million in investment to projects in China.&quot;    The largest recipient of IFC loans is Yugoslavia, with almost $400 million in such aid. Yet Yugoslavia's private sector has fallen, according to Radio Free Europe, from 27% of gross national product in 1962 to 5% in 1986.    The IFC has invested heavily in the Yugoslavian banking system, and thus is likely eventually to show losses from last year's banking collapse, as well as from the nation's inflation rate of as much as 200%. (Until recently, Yugoslavian government controls held interest rates on loans at rates far below the inflation rate).    Despite the IFC's purported commitment to private enterprise, it recently invested $3.2 million to help set up a new government-controlled bank in Hungary to make loans to state-owned enterprises and cooperatives -- and this at a time when the Hungarian government levied heavy new taxes on the limited private enterprises that do exist.    The IFC is eager to begin lending to Poland, as a March 24 confidential project analysis sent to the chairman of the IFC's Investment Committee shows. In it, Douglas Gustafson, the IFC's director of investment for Europe and the Middle East, says of a proposed $18 million loan to a Polish fruit and vegetable cooperative:   &quot;Given the continuing uncertainties about how and when the IMF may {give aid to Poland,} there is a real danger that the Polish authorities may become frustrated with the international financial institutions. IFC has the possibility to act as a bridge during this interim period, by providing a relatively small loan and demonstrating the good intent of the World Bank Group. . . . A fast, early investment by IFC would have enormous effect on IFC's standing in Poland, would demonstrate IFC to be a flexible, responsible institution and would increase the number of investment possibilities in the pipeline. IFC would achieve a great deal of good will by an early investment.&quot;    The World Bank wants to be loved by its bankrupt Communist borrowers -- and also wants to maximize the &quot;investment possibilities&quot; for increased World Bank handouts and growth. Poland has a $40 billion debt that it will never repay -- yet the World Bank is worried about winning Poland's &quot;good will.&quot;    To maintain an appearance of private-sector orientation, IFC loans are prohibited from being guaranteed by governments. Yet, the Polish loan would be guaranteed by Bank Handlowy, which is fully owned by the Polish Ministry of Finance. The IFC skirts this requirement by claiming that Bank Handlowy is a &quot;commercial bank,&quot; and notes in the project analysis: &quot;This approach is similar to that adopted in Yugoslavia and Hungary.&quot; The investment is justified partly on the analysis of the borrower's net worth, which the IFC calculates based on an exchange rate of 175 zlotys to the dollar -- even though the black-market exchange rate in Poland is roughly 1,300 to the dollar.    Outside of the East Bloc, many IFC projects look like international versions of Urban Development Action Grants, funding activities that could occur regardless of IFC handouts. The IFC chipped in $6 million for a Ramada Renaissance Hotel in Grenada, $7 million for a Sheraton Hotel in Fiji, $3.6 million for the expansion of an Intercontinental Hotel in Kenya. As with UDAGs, projects often are justified by the number of &quot;jobs created.&quot; An IFC press release claimed that a $28 million IFC-supported P.T. Bali Holiday Village resort in Indonesia would create &quot;some 300 direct jobs.&quot; But, since the average Indonesian per-capita income is $550, spending almost $90,000 per new job is not quite a bargain.    IFC loans often simply underwrite partnerships between multinational corporations and Third World governments. The IFC lent $9 million to Yemen Hunt Oil Co. in 1985 to build a refinery, in a project that also received a $20 million guarantee from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Hunt Oil Co. has been in partnership with the Yemen Arab Republic since 1981 -- and it is hard to see how providing an IFC cash injection long after the partnership began achieved anything.    The IFC claims that 41 of its 92 investments last year were in companies that were entirely private-sector. Yet, many of the companies the IFC claims are completely private have an extensive government role. In Zambia, the IFC says Zambia Cashew Co. and the Gwembe Valley Development Co. are completely private, but according to Cecilia Momeka of the Zambian Embassy in Washington, the government owns 51% of every corporation in the country. In Togo, the IFC claims that an $850,000 loan went to a private steel mill, but the mill actually is owned by the government and leased for 10 years to a private individual. Moreover, as part of the leasing agreement, Togo promised to keep a 41% tariff on imported steel.    In Argentina, the IFC claims that loans went to three totally private entities in Argentina, but the Argentine government owns stock in all three. In Ghana, the IFC claims an oil-exploration program it is helping is private, but the Ghanaian government owns substantial shares in the corporation. And in China, the IFC claims that China Investment Co. is completely private-but the company will be investing in joint projects between the government of China and foreign investors, which the Chinese government will largely control. In Zimbabwe, the IFC lent $10 million to udc Ltd., a Zimbabwean finance organization, for lending to Zimbabwean businesses. The IFC classifies this project as strictly private-sector. However, every loan that udc Ltd. makes must first be approved by Zimbabwe's Ministry of Industry and Technology or Ministry of Trade and Commerce.    Some IFC loans may actually increase political control over the economy. The IFC has provided five loans to the Panafrican Paper Mills in Kenya since 1970. As part of the Kenyan government's contributions to helping the public-private entity, it sharply increased tariffs on imported paper. The results looked good on Panafrican's balance sheets but clobbered the Kenyan people with higher paper prices.    The IFC's 1985-89 five-year plan calls for a 7% annual increase in loan-investment volume, currently at $1.1 billion. To meet its growth targets, the IFC is planning to increase its investments in South Korea at a time when the private sector is doing just fine on its own. South Korea has already attracted a flood of foreign private investment without the IFC, and the IFC is in Korea largely to boost its loan and equity investments and to snare easy profits.    The IFC, along with the World Bank in general, is based on the idea that a handout provides a stronger incentive than sheer necessity to adopt sound economic policies. Many economists in recipient countries disagree.    Martin Tardos, director of the Hungarian Academy of Science's Institute of Economics, notes: &quot;The World Bank money has made life easier for the Hungarian government and made it possible to avoid deep market-oriented change. The World Bank was not setting conditions for real changes and it accepted the rhetoric for the reality.&quot; In Poland, private citizens have vast dollar reserves saved up in their mattresses. Yet because they have no security for their investments, they don't invest in Polish companies, as Jan Vanous of Planecon Consultants in Washington observes. It is absurd to inject dollars into a country when its own people have no faith in the economic system.    The IFC, like the World Bank in general, has failed in its effort to buy economic reform from Third World and Eastern European politicians. Necessity is still the best incentive for sound economic reform. Insofar as the World Bank reduces the pressure of necessity without securing real reform, it has betrayed the citizens of the Third World and East Europe.    ---   Mr. Bovard is an associate analyst for the Cato Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
