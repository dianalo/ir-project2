(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush, standing on the shore ofLake Erie, proclaimed himself a lifelong environmentalist onWednesday and pledged to reduce acid rain on a ``set timetable.''   ``I will work out the exact amounts and the exact methodologywith Congress,'' Bush said in a speech that aides said was designedto contrast the vice president's environmental views from Reaganadministration policy.   ``But the waiting period for action on acid rain is over ... wemust have a clear commitment to emissions reductions on a settimetable,'' he said.   The Republican presidential nominee also said he would convene aglobal conference during his first year in the White House toaddress the ``greenhouse'' effect. He called for protection ofnatural wetlands and said he wants to ``insure that zero toleranceis applied not only to those who poison our children's minds withdrugs, but to those who poison our water with toxic chemicals.''   After several days of campaigning through the South, Bush chosea key Midwestern battleground state to open a new front in hiscampaign for the White House.   One aide conceded that Bush probably trails Democrat MichaelDukakis in Michigan, which has 20 electoral votes, althoughRepublicans express confidence they will carry the state.   Bush's brief trip blended new campaign proposals in amade-for-television setting near Lake Erie, which has undergonesignificant cleanup in recent years. The vice president took abrief walk along the lake's sandy shore, and cast a fishing lineinto the water as he stopped to talk with a family on an outing.   ``You ever go for the walleyes?'' asked Bush, an avid fisherman.   For the first time in several days, Bush made no mention ofDukakis. But aides said he would couple his environmental themeswith a more aggressive campaign style Thursday with a trip toBoston Harbor, a highly polluted site in Dukakis' home state.   Nor did Bush mention Reagan by name during the day. ``These areGeorge Bush policies. This is what I will do when I'm electedpresident,'' he said when asked whether he was advocating strongerpolicies than Reagan has pursued.   But aides traveling with the vice president said his commitmenton acid rain was drafted with just such an idea in mind.   Reagan has come under attack from environmentalists for dragginghis feet on solving the acid rain problem during his two-termtenure. Earlier this month, however, the president gave thego-ahead for continuing negotiations toward U.S. participation inan international treaty to freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides, aprecursor to acid rain.   ``On the question of acid rain, the time for study alone haspassed,'' Bush said. ``We know enough to begin taking steps tolimit future damage ... as president, I will ask for a program tocut millions of tons of sulfer dioxide emissions by the year 2,000and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.''   The vice president offered no specifics.   Bush also said the Superfund has sufficient money to handlecleanup of toxic waste sites and said the Environmental ProtectionAgency should move aggressivly against those responsibile fordumping.   ``Polluters should pay,'' he said. ``I am an environmentalist,always have been, from my earliest days growing up and then as acongressman ... and I always will be... that's not inconsistentwith being a businessman nor is it with being a conservative.''   The campaign trip was plagued by the latest in a string ofaircraft problems when a United Airlines jet chartered to flyreporters to Michigan developed problems and was unable to fly.   A replacement plane was brought in, but didn't reach Michiganuntil after Bush had finished his speech. Reporters on boardarrived in time to see the vice president pay a visit to theMichigan State Fair.</TEXT></DOC>
