You are called on thecarpet for being too lax and simultaneously castigated forbeing too tough. Meanwhile, you are required to make toughjudgment calls every day regardless of the politicalatmosphere.</LP><TEXT>   The way you do your job has important consequences for theeconomy. It is a demanding task. Yet, few people understandthe decisions you must make. Nor do they comprehend theperspective you must bring to your job.   Plainly, we are in a recession. Recession and its twin --unemployment -- raise the political temperature. Politicalrhetoric takes wing. Causes are dissected and discussed.Solutions are tossed about. And, of course, villains aresought. Bank examiners are not isolated from this debate.   Getting back on the path of economic growth depends on anumber of factors. Some, like consumer confidence andinterest rates, are far beyond your control. But in others,like credit availability, you have an important role. Innurturing our economic recovery, bank credit is absolutelycritical, particularly for those small and medium-sizedbusinesses that do not have easy access to capital markets.   Banks will lend when they have reasonable financialstrength and faith in the future. To be sure, some banks havebeen weakened by a combination of improvident lending and theeconomic downturn. But there are many more banks, by far thegreat majority, that are well-positioned to make sound,profitable loans.   It is in this matter of confidence that you are a decisivefactor. Banks will not lend, regardless of the economicforecast, in an atmosphere of fear -- fear that theregulators will consistently judge loans only by the bookrather than by understanding the specifics of individualcases. In the past, the professional examiner was one whounderstood that each loan had its own history, problems andpossible solutions. The examiner looked to bank management'scapacity to identify the problems and find solutions.   Yet, now many bank examiners believe they will be exposedto criticism from their bosses or Congress if they use theirjudgment. No examiner has ever been criticized for being tootough. So, some examiners have discarded balanced judgmentfor the most conservative application of the rule books. Thenbank officials, to reduce assets classified as problems, stopmaking loans, refuse to renew loans in fields subject tointense regulatory scrutiny, such as real estate, and callloans on the slightest pretext.   Of course, banks sometimes blame the regulators when thebank has good business reasons to deny a loan but does notwant to take the heat from the customer. But there is morethan enough evidence to conclude that there exists awidespread regulatory anxiety among banks that diminishes thesupply of credit.   That examiners are pursuing the &quot;safe&quot; path isunderstandable. But the consequences may be disastrous. Thereare some who encourage the regulators to pursue atake-no-prisoners approach. This is typically the response ofthose who did not foresee the consequences of their actionsin the case of the Sandamp;Ls and now have become convertedextremists. In that sense, they are following the path ofleast resistance to criticism rather than attempting to putforth constructive, workable solutions.   The latest entrant in this competition in piety is theGeneral Accounting Office. Like many others, it failed toanticipate the Sandamp;L train wreck. Now it seems to have adopteda politically secure policy for financial institutionregulation. In brief, its report suggests more regulation,accounting standards that border on the much criticizedmark-to-market standards, and denying any reform of theantiquated laws that strangle bank profitability and diminishthe presence of U.S. banks in the world's financial markets.With hindsight, it is easy to take shots at the bankregulators. But this is more of a political exercise than acontribution to the future.   Recently, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady urged seniorbank regulators to adopt a &quot;philosophy of common sense.&quot; Hereiterated concerns that aggressive bank regulation may havecontributed to the credit crunch. Furthermore, he urgedregulators to quickly implement the accounting clarificationsissued in March that, it is believed, will provide banks withclearer understanding about regulatory policies for settingaside reserves against bad loans, working with troubledborrowers and extending new credit.   Examiners, the ball is in your court. The nation needs andwants vigorous, informed and balanced bank regulation. Whatmost people do not understand is that examination -- justlike bank lending -- depends upon judgment.   Some have alleged that these new standards are nothingmore than accounting gimmicks that will lead the system downthe slippery slope of the Sandamp;Ls. Just the opposite. These newinterpretations give you more freedom to do what you havealways done so well -- use your experience and common sensein judging the quality of loans.   I know you have a tough job, but I have total confidencein your ability to perform it well. And I know that you knowhow the banking system operates. In the final analysis,confidence in the system is key. And you are the men andwomen who set the level of confidence.   While the politicians, rating agencies and others whoshould know better are covering their past mistakes, only thebank examiners can be a voice for reason and balance.   ---   Mr. Heimann, Merrill Lynch's chairman for global financialinstitutions, was New York state superintendent of banks,1975-77, and U.S. comptroller of the currency, 1977-81.</TEXT></DOC>
