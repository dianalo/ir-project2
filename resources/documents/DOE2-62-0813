Mini cogeneratorsstand out far above conventional power producing facilities with regardto efficient use of very finite and diminishing resources. The reasonthat micro cogeneration has such high prospects is the growing weightof public opinion. According to the N.R.C. via the Washington Post, thereis a 45% chance of a nuclear reactor core melt down within the next 20years in the U.S. The Department of Energy's, Sandia Laboratories, hasstated that the financial impact of a catastrophe of this magnitude,involving a moderate size generating station, would be upwards of 300billion dollars (adjusted for 1987 dollars). The public is finding thesestatistics unacceptable. It is also becoming public opinion that 'waste',especially in the form of non-renewable resources, must come to an end.The public is becoming increasingly unwilling to watch the environmentdeteriorate, and species of wild life become extinct almost daily. Inshort, the weight of public opinion in a free society will be seen inthe future as having the greatest impact in determining the tremendousprospects that now lay ahead for power generation realities like packagedcogeneration systems.</TEXT></DOC>
