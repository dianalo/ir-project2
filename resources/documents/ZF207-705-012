 Dialog Manager can also be used tobuild special-purpose graphics and icons into a PM application.andM;Intelligent Environments Inc., of Chelmsford, Mass., is preparing to add 3270and 5250 emulation capabilities to a PM development tool, ApplicationsManager.andP;  Applications Manager lets developers build complete applications,including CUA-compliant interfaces.andP;  It contains libraries of PM functioncalls and logic variables.andM;Developers are also offering object-oriented languages that can be applied toMicrosoft Windows, X Windows and the Macintosh as well as PM.andM;Graphic Software Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., is offering its ExtensibleVirtual Toolkit (XVT), a library of C functions that supports the developmentof graphical interfaces for PM, Windows and the Mac.andP;  The tool is designed toeliminate the code editing and rewriting currently required to run the sameapplication in several different graphical environments.andM;MDBS Inc. of Lafayette, Ind., is beta-testing Object/1, an object-oriented PMdevelopment language set to be shipped by year's end.andP;  Object/1 will providea graphical forms painter that supports the construction of data-entry andretrieval screens linked to modular blocks of reusable logic code.andM;Digitalk Inc. of Los Angeles will release in October Smalltalk/V for PM, anobject-oriented programming language that will support the development ofgraphical PM applications.andM;CommonView, from Glockenspiel Ltd., of Dublin, Ireland, is designed to easethe transition between Windows and PM applications and to support thecreation of new PM applications.andP;  It includes Glockenspiel's C++ translatorand object class libraries.andM;Easing the transition between Windows and PM is also what prompted MicrografxInc. of Richardson, Texas, to market Mirrors, a dynamic link library of PMfunction calls.andP;  Mirrors allows Windows applications to run underPresentation Manager without modification.andM;Other development tools help programmers develop only the graphicalinterface.andP;  They produce a graphical shell that is ready to be linked toprogram logic code, which must be written separately.andM;CASEworks Inc. of Atlanta is shipping CASE:PM, an OS/2 version of its earlierWindows programming tool, CASE:W.andP;  The PM tool automatically generates aresource-definition file and all the C code files required to produce a PMinterface.andM;Xian Corp., of Ridgewood, N.J., has produced an interface-development toolcalled WinproPM to speed up the production of the PM interface.andP;  WinproPMconverts a PM resource-definition file into C source-code files, headerfiles, a module-definition file, a linker-response file and a program &quot;make&quot;file.andM;A Pittsburgh-based startup, Virtual Machine Corp., claims its VisualActivetool will allow developers to produce PM interfaces in one-tenth the time ittakes to do the job manually.andP;  The product includes programming tools and alibrary of standard PM interface objects.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
