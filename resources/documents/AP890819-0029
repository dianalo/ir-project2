The latest monthly estimate by the department's Economic ResearchService, released Friday, says net cash income is expected to be inthe range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with $50 billionto $55 billion predicted in July.   Last year, because of rising commodity prices because of thedrought-shriveled harvest, net cash income was a record $59.9billion. That figure was also revised upward from last month'sestimate of $58 billion for 1988 income.   Net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during theyear and represents the difference between gross cash income andcash expenses. For example, 1988 sales of grain stored from harvestsin earlier years were counted as part of the 1988 gross.   Another method of USDA bookkeeping measures ``net farm income''for the calendar year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out systeminvolved in ``net cash income.''   By this alternate method, changes in the value of farminventories are taken into consideration and allowances are made for``non-money'' items such as depreciation, the family consumption offarm-grown foods and the net rental value of dwellings.   Net farm income in 1989 was forecast at $48 billion to $53billion, up $1 billion from projections in July. In 1988, net farmincome was reported at $45.7 billion, which was revised up from $44billion a month ago.   One reason for net cash income being down from the record 1988level is that farmers have put more land back into production thisyear, meaning larger expenses for field preparation, weed controland harvesting. Also, government payments to farmers are downsharply this year.   ``Forecasters are divided on whether the U.S. economy is headedfor a brief slowdown or a downturn,'' the report said. ``Agricultureis likely to find the general economy mildly supportive in eithercase. Lower interest rates and perhaps lower exchange rates, commonto both outlooks, would reduce farm costs and boost agriculturalexports.''   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 5 percent to 7 percent,on average, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1988. Most of theexpected increase took place in the first half of 1989, the reportsaid.   The agency said wheat and rice prices are likely to rise,although overall grain and soybean production ``will increasemarkedly'' from 1988, despite a heavy toll from poor weather.</TEXT></DOC>
