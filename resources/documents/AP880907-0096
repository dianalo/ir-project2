The expecation that anyone holding the office (of vicepresident) will, as the saying goes, ``grow in office,'' seemswistfully and overly optimistic given the lack of duties of theposition. ...   Americans will just have to conclude that there is some unseenquality in both vice presidential candidates that will sometime berevealed.   Neither Quayle nor Bentsen makes us stop asking the decades-longquestion that haunts so many Americans. How come we never get anygreat leaders anymore?</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 31   Honolulu Star-Bulletin on Dan Quayle:   The nation has gone more than a half-week now without uncoveringanything new in Sen. Dan Quayle's past or overstated in his resume.   It could mean the media are filled up on their latest ``feedingfrenzy'' or that Quayle's closet of skeletons has been deboned.   Whatever the reason, the break in the Quayle chase comes as arelief, believe it or not, to the Democrats, whose presidentialticket was in serious danger of being ignored.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 6   Arkansas Democrat, Little Rock, Ark., on education loans:   As though it weren't enough that too many college graduatesdefault on their student loans, word now comes from the GeneralAccounting Office that the lenders who extend thegovernment-secured loans are also gouging Uncle Sam.   GAO doesn't say it's being done deliberately. It just says thelenders are getting millions in excess subsidies each year becausethe U.S. Department of Education is lax in checking the accuracy oftheir bills for the loan interest the government pays. ...   The federal watchdog agency says that the loan act should berewritten to allow the Secretary of Education to charge interest onoverpayments made to lenders and also to require that the latteremploy independent auditors to certify the loan accounts andinterest billings.   Congress could and should do that before the current sessionexpires.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 6   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on airport security:   Vigilance against hijackings and other misdeeds that threatenthe safety of airline passengers obviously is not what it should be.   Thirty-two of the nation's commercial airlines have been fined atotal of $1 million by the Federal Aviation Administration forfailing to provide adequate security checks at airports.   Inspectors still were able to smuggle phony weapons aboardplanes without having them detected by X-ray machines, guards ormetal detectors 15 percent of the time they tried to do so, the FAAsaid. ...   The airlines had better remedy the problem swiftly, lestwould-be hijackers and other goofballs use the list as a handyreference.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 6   The Atlanta Constitution on an energy policy:   By 1979, the United States had wrestled a comprehensive energypolicy into place.   Shocked by prices that had been quadrupled by the monopolisticOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the nation adoptedpolicies designed to reduce its energy dependence sharply.   The idea was to protect ourselves from future vulnerability toOPEC, but over the eight years of the Reagan administration, theenergy program has been dismantled. ...   No, the strategies of the late '70s were not necessarilyappropriate for all time, and, yes, more of the energy savings ofthe early '80s were caused by extortionate prices than by federalpolicy.   But guiding policies are needed all the more in the absence ofconservation-forcing high prices, and it is blithe, at best, to actas if the nation needs no energy policy at all.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 6   Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News on the U.S. security policy:   Security policy represents both a quandry and an opportunity forthe next American president: a quandry because a decade ofunprecedented peacetime buildup of U.S. defense capacity cannot,for budgetary reasons, be continued _ and an opportunity for muchthe same reason.   The opportunity is clear, and it flows directly out of thematuration of policy under President Reagan in the past two years....   How to grasp the opportunity? Four key steps: reduce thesuperpowers' nuclear arsenal, as President Reagan has longproposed; keep the arms race out of space, as the Soviets havesuggested; untangle the East-West standoff in Europe, ... andcontrol the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons. ...   Americans should listen carefully to what Michael Dukakis andGeorge Bush have to say about these matters _ and consider which ofthem is better equipped to exploit the opportunities.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 2   Marshall (Minn.) Independent on human rights in Romania:   Congress has gone on record opposing plans of PresidentCeausescu of Romania to destroy more than half the traditional folkvillages in his country.   Under a massive collectivization program, Romania would bulldoze7,000 of its 13,000 traditional villages to make way forgovernment-owned agricultural-industrial complexes.   The displaced people would be hearded into state-owned,standardized housing units to be built in centuries-old towncenters. ...   Violation of human rights of all its citizens is part of thegovernment's miserable record. It has denied its 2.5 million ethnicminorities the right to preserve their native language.   Recent congressional action expressing outrage at Romanianrepression will have little effect of the contempt for human rightsand cultural legacies displayed by Ceausescu.   But it may give some hope to the oppressed minorities in Romaniathat their plight has not gone unnoticed.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
