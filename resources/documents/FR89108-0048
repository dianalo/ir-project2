At the request of the petitioner, the National Pork ProducersCouncil (NPPC), we held a public hearing on August 5, 1988. The NPPC, theCanadian Pork Council (CPC), and Quintaine andamp; Sons Ltd., the major Canadianexporter of slaughter sows and boars, took part in the hearing.<T3>Comment 1:</T3> The CPC points out that the Department misread thefinancial statement of the Farm Income Stabilization Commission (``FISC'')of Ontario in calculating the benefit from the Ontario Weaner Pig StabilizationPlan.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree and have revised our calculationsaccordingly. We determine the benefit from this program to be Can$0.00000037/lb.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> The CPC asks the Department to clarify its rationalefor determining that the Agricultural Stabilization Act (``ASA''), theNational Tripartite Red Meat Stabilization (``Tripartite'') Program, theBritish Columbia Farm Income Insurance Program, and the Quebec Farm IncomeStabilization Insurance Program are limited to specific industries. TheCPC also requests that the Department establish detailed criteria to explainfurther its specificity test by answering the following questions: If allmajor commodities in a jurisdiction were covered by stabilization programs,would these programs then be considered not countervailable? How is a majorcommodity defined? If all major commodities are covered by a stabilizationor other program (<T3>e.g., </T3>supply management) at the national or provincial level,should not the Department take this factor into account? On the other hand,if there are no clearly discernible major commodities in a jurisdiction,is it possible to pass the Department's specificity test if less than 100percent of the commercial farm products are covered by a stabilizationprogram? If so, how much less than 100 percent: 90, 80, 60, or 51 percent?How is coverage measured: by number of products, tonnage, or value?<T3>Department's Position:</T3> As stated in our preliminary results, wecontinue to regard the subsidy programs referred to by the CPC as countervailablebecause they are provided to specific industries. Several aspects of theASA have changed since our final determination (50 FR 25097, June 17, 1985).Furthermore, we received additional information on the Tripartite program,the British Columbia Farm Income Insurance Program, and the Quebec FarmIncome Stabilization Insurance Program. However, we received no additionalevidence that any of these programs are not still limited to specific industries.For example, with respect to the ASA, several major agricultural commodities,such as most wheat, dairy products, and poultry, are still ineligible forpayments. Several major agricultural products are also excluded from theBritish Columbia Farm Income Insurance Program (<T3>e.g., </T3>wheat, dairy products, and poultry) and the Quebec FarmIncome Stabilization Insurance Program (<T3>e.g., </T3>milk products, poultry, and eggs). Therefore, we determinethat these four programs continue to be countervailable.The request by the CPC that the Department establish detailed criteriato explain further its specificity test appears to be a request for anadvisory opinion. We do not consider it appropriate to issue advisory opinionsbased upon hypothetical situations. Also, it is well established that theDepartment's specificity test cannot be reduced to a mathematical formulabecause domestic subsidy programs are seldom identical. The terms and conditionsof domestic subsidy programs differ from case to case, as do the circumstancesunder which a specific program may be used. Thus, we cannot reduce ourtest for specificity to a single formula that would be applicable to everycase, as CPC implicitly suggests we should. Instead, we must analyze eachprogram on its own merits and weigh various factors before we can determinethat a program is or is not provided, either <T3>de jure </T3>or <T3>de facto, </T3>to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries.Parties, however, are not without guidance. The determinations publishedby the Department provide a significant body of precedents by which a domesticsubsidy program may be analyzed. Moreover, we routinely consider the followingfactors when we apply the specificity test: (1) The extent to which a foreigngovernment acts to limit the availability of a program; (2) the numberof enterprises, industries, or groups that actually use a program; (3)the dominant or disproportionate use of a program by certain enterprises,industries or groups; and (4) the extent to which the foreign governmentexercises discretion when it confers benefits under a program. <T3>See, e.g., Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination:Certain Softwood Lumber Products from Canada </T3>(51 FR 37453, October22, 1986)).<T3>Comment 3:</T3> The NPPC contends that the Department's preliminarydetermination that the Record of Performance Program (ROP) is not countervailableis based on errors of law and mistakes of fact. As long as the ROP is providedto a specific industry, the Department should find the program to be countervailable.The NPPC claims that while the results of the ROP research are nominallyavailable to any interested party, few, if any, parties other than theCanadian hog industry are interested in the results. Only the Canadianhog industry can benefit from the ROP research because the informationgenerated is specifically tailored for the production practices and climaticconditions existing only in Canada. ROP data cannot be used by other industriesin Canada or by the hog industry in the United States.The NPPC argues that the Department's long-standing practice is to findresearch and development programs such as the ROP to be countervailableand, to support its assertion, cites Appendix 2 to <T3>Certain Steel Products from Belgium, </T3>47 FR 39304, (1982); <T3>Optic Liquid Level Sensing Systems from Canada, </T3>44 FR 1728, (1979);and <T3>Certain Steel Products from France, </T3>47 FR 39332, (1982).<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. In Appendix 2 to <T3>Certain Steel Products from Belgium, </T3>we determined that assistanceprovided by a foreign government to finance research and development doesnot confer a countervailable benefit if the research and development hasbroad application and yields results that are made available to the public.In <T3>Optic Liquid Level Sensing Systems from Canada, </T3>we found thatthe research and development program provided selective treatment becausethe information generated was not publicly available and was only usedto improve the respondent's ability to introduce a commercially successfulproduct to market. In <T3>Certain Steel Products from France, </T3>we examined two research anddevelopment programs, one publicly available and the other not. We foundonly the program whose research was not publicly available to be countervailable.The NPPC submitted no information to support its claim that the availabilityand applicability of ROP research data are selective. The CPC, on the otherhand, submitted in its rebuttal brief numerous examples of the broad applicationand public use outside of Canada of the research and development generatedby the ROP. Among the documents submitted by the CPC are copies of scientificpapers published outside Canada using ROP data; copies of papers on theresults of Canadian ROP tests submitted to the National Swine ImprovementFederation in St. Louis, Missouri; extensive mailing lists of recipientsof ROP data, including recipients in the United States as well as otherforeign countries; circulation lists of <T3>Canadian Swine, </T3>a Canadian industry magazine, that include manysubscribers in the United States; and copies of <T3>Canadian Swine </T3>announcements of breeding stock sales_all withROP data listed. The examples of the wide public use of this informationsupports our preliminary determination that the ROP research data are publiclyavailable and applicable to hog producers all over the world, includingthose in the United States. For these reasons, we determine that the ROPprogram is not counteravailable.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>The NPPC contends that the Department understated thebenefit from all programs by weight-averaging benefits according to eachprovince's proportion of total Canadian exports of live swine to the UnitedStates. The NPPC claims that weight-averaging by province rather than byproducer is grossly distortive of market realities, wide open to circumvention,and improper as applied to this case. The Department should focus on theoverall effect that the subsidies have on production and calculate onecountry-wide rate for all hogs by dividing the total amount of subsidiesfrom all provinces by the total Canadian production of live swine. Geographicboundaries are meaningless to the production, flow and pricing of any commoditywhose production is easily stimulated by government subsidies. Futhermore,weight-averaging by province creates strong incentives to circumvent orevade countervailing duties by transshipping hogs within Canada prior toexporting to the United States. The Newfoundland transshipments found bythe Department in its preliminary results demonstrate that the threat oftransshipment is valid.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. In this administrative review,as in the original countervailing duty investigation, we did not investigateindividual producers, electing instead to focus on aggregate benefits providedby the federal and provincial governments to producers of live swine. Wedid this because of the large number of hog producers and the administrativeburden imposed in analyzing and verifying numerous responses.To calculate the subsidy, we divided, for each province, total benefitspaid to hog producers in that province by total production in that province.We then weight-averaged these benefits by the provincial shares of totalCanadian exports of the subject merchandise to the United States.In our view, this method provides a better measure of the subsidy on exportsto the United States than that proposed by the NPPC. This is because itgives greater weight to those provinces which ship more hogs to the UnitedStates and therefore more accurately reflects the level of subsidy on thesubject merchandise.The danger of transshipment is minimal because the same countervailingduty rate on live swine applies to all of Canada. We believe that the transshipmentscenario described by the NPPC is too far removed from reality to poseany significant threat to the integrity of the countervailing duty law.As we stated in our preliminary results, the individual producer usuallyis not aware of the ultimate destination of his hogs. Furthermore, it isimpossible for individual producers to predict which province will havethe lowest benefit because the Department does not calculate provincialbenefits until up to two years after the time of exportation. Finally,the Newfoundland transshipments do not support the NPPC's argument becausethey were made at a time that the cash deposit rate was calculated in themanner that the NPPC is now advocating.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>The NPPC states that, although it does not challengethe Department's creation of a subclass or kind of merchandise for sowsand boars, the Department should announce strict definitions of sows, boars,and slaughter hogs in order to prevent circumvention of the order by masqueradingbona fide slaughter hogs as sows and boars. Quintaine opposes NPPC's requestfor strict definitions as unnecessary because industry standards determinethe weight of sows and boars and because sows and boars are sold and shippedseparately, command different prices, and have different markets.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree with the NPPC and agree withQuintaine. In our preliminary results of review, we found that sows andboars are distinguishable from other live swine not only by their physicalcharacteristics, but also by their ultimate use, markets and prices. Further,there is no financial incentive to sell slaughter hogs at the much lowerprice commanded by sows and boars.<T3>Comment 6: </T3>The NPPC disputes the Department's estimate that sowsand boars represent only one percent of Canadian production of live swine.The NPPC claims that the figure should be at least four percent, whichis the approximate proportion of sows and boars to all live swine producedin the United States.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree that the one-percent figure underestimatesthe production of sows and boars in Canada. We requested more precise informationfrom Canada. The CPC submitted a hog cost model developed by the MarketOutlook and Analysis Division, Policy Branch, Agriculture Canada. The hogcost model was developed after the passage of the 1985 amendment to theASA and is used for calculating the benefits from the Tripartite swineprogram. The model is a national average of provincial/regional costs ofproduction of hogs. The model, which is updated yearly, was designed toreflect current industry structure and production practices. The modelestimates that the proportion of sows and boars to total live swine productionin Canada is 2.1 percent. We believe that this is the most accurate estimateavailable.Adjusting for this change, we have recalculated the benefits from the variousprograms to be:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p6,7/8,g1,t1,i1,s25,11</C> <H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Pound</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">1.
