But no. My well-educated friend had never heard of it. Wewere driving toward this weatherbeaten port on thenorthwestern coast of Spain, through the soft, stony hills ofGalicia, where the fields are small, and the vineyards too,and a farmer may own no more than a cow or a couple of sheep.   It rains here more than in any other place on thepeninsula. The people are of Celtic origin and speak theirown Iberian language, Gallego or Galician, which is eventaught in schools and spoken on a special television channel.Like other Celts, they have the bagpipe. Theirs is small,with a characteristic remote, mournful sound.   Moore's body was later removed from its rude grave to aserene Roman sarcophagus now standing in the middle of awalled garden that overlooks the port at the foot of theCiudad Vieja. Inscribed on one side is the poem itself, whichwas written by Charles Wolfe. On the other is a pronouncementof the Duke of Wellington as to the matchless bravery ofSpanish soldiers. Moore's army and his Spanish allies hadbeen caught in the snowy mountain passes inland and all butcut to pieces by the French cavalry.   The garden is shrouded by elms and plane trees, date palmsand spidery hibiscus. Over the wall and down past thebarracks and fortifications, the harbor sweeps toward a Romanlighthouse. From here the Invincible Armada set sail forEngland in 1588, the priests chanting Mass and the incensebillowing as the soldiers dropped to their knees on thegalleon decks.   La Coruna is a big fishing port thick with ocean-goingtrawlers, which is why The Correo Gallego carries a headline,otherwise odd in a local paper, about a dispute overterritorial waters off southwest Africa. Galicians (Gallegos)are famous in Spain for being tough and crafty. FranciscoFranco was a Gallego, and so were many Spanish immigrants toAmerica in the past century.   Around the corner from the Ciudad Vieja, with its littlepalaces and its twisted, Romanesque church, rise theapartment houses of the modern town, shuttered in glassmiradors that are the passive solar answer to the fierceclimate of the Bay of Biscay. We take the coast road to turnthe corner of the continent, but soon it turns into apotholed asphalt track threading along and around the blackhighlands, shadowed by pine and eucalyptus. We went inland,in order to head roundabout for Cape Finisterre (literallyland's end), the westernmost point of Europe.   We reached the coast again south of the cape itself andnavigated a gale-beaten country. Little patches of brightgrass bearded with golden broom lay below solemn,druidic-looking rocks. From time to time on the other side ofthe road arcs of brilliant white beach flowed along theshallows of cobalt and aquamarine.   Mile after mile the car followed the banks of the &quot;rias,&quot;as the surging inlets are called. Once or twice there was avillage with a bus stop, a car or two, and, at Muros, a townmarket. Far out on the flats left by the tide, men and womenworked for clams with rakes and baskets.   Now mountains rose along the coast, as the cape swung intoview, with white specks of houses below a smooth pale peak,pale green and lavender in the stormy sun, and black in thestorms themselves. There were no sailboats, no pleasure craftin the harbors, no tennis courts dug into the hills, no golfcourses, no swimming pools, no beach umbrellas, and not asummer hotel angled to catch, or shelter from, the Atlanticwinds.   Far inland, in the countryside near Santiago deCompostela, there is plenty of building and bustle, remindingthe traveller of prosperous and &quot;European&quot; Spain.   And along the roads, in a constant if unrealized processof improvement and enlargement, every fifth or sixth car, itseems, carries a rooftop sign signifying that yet anotherperson is learning to drive.   ---   Mr. King is director of the Foreign Press Center in NewYork.</TEXT></DOC>
