Farmers have to dosomething to control insect pests, weeds and fungi, and environmentalregulators are making it harder and harder to use chemicals.;    What bettertactic than using genetic engineering and other biotech weapons to arm plantswith more biopesticides, the very micro-organisms that they have used forself-defense for millions of years?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AGRICULTURE PROVIDES FERTILE FIELDS FOR BIOTECH  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The idea of harnessing biopesticides has sounded good enough to extract afew hundred million dollars from venture capitalists and other investors instartup companies since the early 1980s.;    Considerable sums have also beenspent on research at major agricultural chemical and seed companies. So far,though, agricultural biotechnology has trailed far behind medicalbiotechnology in product development, profitability and, not surprisingly, theaffections of Wall Street. Indeed, agricultural biotechnology is scarcelyfollowed by analysts and the investment community they serve.;    &quot;We in theag field are the Rodney Dangerfields of biotech,&quot; said Jerry Caulder, chiefexecutive of Mycogen Corp., which is based in San Diego and is the most highlycapitalized and best-known start-up in the biopesticide field.;    Caulder isnot the only one who thinks it is time biopesticides received more respect.George S. Dahlman, an analyst at the Minneapolis brokerage firm of Piper,Jaffrey andamp; Hopwood, invited a group of investment advisers and fund managers toa Manhattan hotel recently to hear presentations by Caulder andrepresentatives of four other companies.;    &quot;I think you'll come out a winnerby 1995 if you buy a little of all of these,&quot; Dahlman said in his closingremarks.;    In addition to Mycogen, the companies Dahlman assembled includedCalgene Inc., Crop Genetics International, Ecogen Inc. and Ringer Corp., whichis trying to apply the same technology to lawn- and garden-care products.;   If the companies meet Dahlman's projections for when they will becomeprofitable, their shares could advance at an average annual rate ranging from10 percent for Calgene to 40 percent for Ringer by 1995, assuming they tradeat 20 times earnings.;    &quot;Everything needs to click for that to happen,&quot; hecautioned. Dahlman is not the only enthusiast. Michael Sorell at MorganStanley has been recommending Mycogen for the last year and believes thestock, which trades at $13.50, should reach $20 by the end of the year. 13DResearch Inc. of New Rochelle, N.Y., which specializes in growth companiesthat are small, also has a &quot;buy&quot; on the stock.;    Mycogen's first targetshave been the Colorado potato beetle, which attacks tomatoes and eggplants inaddition to its namesake, and caterpillars that eat vegetables.;    The stockhas been extremely volatile, rising to a peak of $20.75 last summer after 2.8million shares were sold at $17.75. Dahlman expects the company to break evenfor the first time this year.;    Ecogen, Mycogen's most direct competitor, isprobably two years away from profitability. But its stock has been one of thehottest in the market in recent months, rising from a low of $1 to $6.88 asthe company announced a series of product development alliances with largeEuropean companies, most notably a $12.73 million deal with Roussel-UCLAF ofFrance.;    Crop Genetics, which is three years away from projectedprofitability, has what some analysts believe is an even more excitingtechnical approach. It implants the crucial BT genes for making insecticidesor fungicides inside endophytes, micro-organisms that live inside the plant.Unlike Mycogen and Ecogen, its goal is to compete first in the largestmarkets, starting with corn.;    Each company is also engaged in efforts todevelop other biotechnology-based products that are not genetically engineeredpesticides.;    Calgene is best known for these alternative efforts, mostnotably its genetic engineering programs aimed at developing tastier tomatoesand improving oilseed crops like canola and rapeseed. But the company hasdemonstrated an ability to use BT to create insect-resistant cotton.;    Whywait to invest? &quot;In medical biotechnology, if you get Food and DrugAdministration approval for your product and it meets a need, the orders comepouring in,&quot; said Teena Lerner, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.&quot;There's not even a price issue, which guarantees high margins. Inagriculture, it takes a long time to build your market.&quot;; A LOOK AT THESTOCKS; Here are  the 52-week highs and lows for selected     agriculturalbiotechnology stocks.; Stock           High          Low           Now; ...;Calgene       $9.13          $4.25         $6.13; Crop Genetics   8.75         3.00          4.50; Ecogen         12.13          1.00          8.50; Mycogen      20.75           8.50          13.50; Ringer        7.75            3.63          6.75; Source:  Mercury News Library; Mercury News  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Home  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910506  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  763  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday May 6, 199100127002,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
