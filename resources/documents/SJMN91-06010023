We Will Grow Still Greater, Still Stronger.&quot;; EXCERPTS FROMWILSON'S ADDRESS; Here are excerpts from Gov. Pete Wilson's State of the Stateaddress, delivered Wednesday to a joint session of the Legislature:; Onprenatal care:;    The best, most prudent investment we can make as acivilized society is prenatal care to detect and treat preventable birthdefects. No other action can have anything like the impact of prenatal care inreducing the human and financial costs of the life-long disabilities that areprevented. I will present to you a $53 million plan to establish apublic-private program to enable low-income women to purchase insurance forprenatal and maternity services.; On illegal drugs:;    Dealing drugs -- andlet's not mince words -- is a crime of violence, and a cold-blooded,premeditated crime for profit. . . . If you sell hard drugs to children,anytime or anywhere that children congregate, I propose that you have 15 yearslonger to regret it than at present. And for you who knowingly deal drugs topregnant women, I pledge I'll do everything in my power to find a way to putyou away for life.; On the environment:;    Within weeks, I'll propose areorganization plan to create a California Environmental Protection Agency --Cal-EPA. This consolidation of state environmental functions will focusresource management functions in the Resources Agency and environmentalregulation and risk assessment in Cal-EPA. . . . Cal-EPA will have a newcharter, and it will have this governor's mandate that we are going to besensible and caring stewards of our land, air and water.; On localgovernment:;    As a former mayor, I have great faith in the work of localgovernments -- and great respect and sympathy for the difficult pressuresunder which they must labor. I propose shifting to local government bothadministration of public health and mental health programs, and all the newrevenues to do the job and grow with program needs. In addition, there'll belegislation to grant counties the ability, with local voter approval, toincrease sales taxes one-half cent to fight crime and to provide drugtreatment and education services.; On the budget:;    If we did absolutelynothing to control programs and to erase this deficit over the next 18 months,the average family of four would see their state taxes go up by almost $1,000per year. As an alternative, state sales taxes would have to increase by 42percent. That simply is not fair. . . . My budget contains an 18-month actionplan with the following key features: It is balanced with a prudent reserve of$1.4 billion. It contains no general increases in income, corporations orsales taxes; and it contains long-term budget reform.; On welfare programs:;   One expenditure will be reduced. The AFDC (Aid to Families with DependentChildren) program should provide subsistence for poor children that will keepthem, along with all other social services, healthy and well-nourished. Buttreating welfare as a socially acceptable permanent lifestyle is a disserviceto AFDC children. It risks perpetuating dependency from generation togeneration. And that's the worst thing we can do. The budget for AFDC hasexploded in California. In 1975, California ranked 16th in such payments. Nowwe're second only to Alaska. The  average payment in that period has jumpednearly 2 1/2 times, so that we pay a single mother with two children a monthly average of $694, compared to $184 in Texas.; State of the State highlights;Here are some of the key points of Gov. Pete Wilson's agenda for California,as outlined in his State of the State speech Wednesday night:; (box)TAXES: Nogeneral increases in income, corporation or sales taxes, but possible&quot;loophole closing&quot; expansions of those taxes and a wide range of fee increasesincluding at state universities.; (box)HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES: Noautomatic cost-of-living increases for welfare, Medi-Cal and other annuallyadjusted programs. No cutback on Medi-Cal eligibility standards. Public healthand mental health programs shifted to local governments.; (box)CRIME:Continued support for expensive tough-on-crime sentencing laws, with a pushfor even stiffer sentences for some crimes. Half-cent sales tax increase topay for anti-crime and drug programs in counties where voters agree.;(box)ENVIRONMENT: New California Environmental Protection Agency to regulatepesticides and toxic waste.; (box)DROUGHT: A weekly review of the crisis, andan appeal for voluntary conservation.; (box)BIPARTISANSHIP: Early and frequentmeetings with legislative leaders to avoid political gridlock.; (box)RAINY DAYFUND: A &quot;prudent&quot; $1.4 billion emergency reserve.; Governor's 10-point plan;Gov. Pete Wilson proposed a 10-point plan Wednesday to &quot;move  from reactionand remedy to anticipation and prevention&quot; in California's public schools andhealth and drug programs:;  1. A $53 million prenatal health care plan totreat preventable birth defects.;  2. A $20 million &quot;Healthy Start&quot; program tointegrate county health and social services into schools.;  3. New mentalhealth counseling in elementary schools.;  4. A $50 million preschool programfor low-income 4-year-olds.;  5. A new volunteer mentor program in schools.; 6. Junior and senior high school drug education programs aimed at preventingsubstance abuse during pregnancy.;  7. A $25 million increase in substanceabuse prevention among pregnant women.;  8. Increased money for the Office ofFamily Planning's birth control programs.;  9. New school accountability andstudent assessment procedures.; 10. New authority to local schools so they canenact general obligation bonds for new schools by majority vote.; WHAT OTHERSSAY ABOUT WHAT WILSON SAID;    &quot;We all felt it was a breath of fresh air. Thisspeech could have been given by Dianne Feinstein.;    &quot;He's talking aboutprograms that George Deukmejian has vetoed for years.&quot;; Assemblywoman; DelaineEastin,; D-Fremont; (hbox); &quot;I think (his proposal to cut welfare) ratherstrange. I don't understand how he can think people can live on less than whatGeorge Deukmejian proposed.;    &quot;How can you live in the state of Californiaon less than $600 a month? I don't understand how you can do that.;   Assembly Speaker; Willie Brown,; D-San Francisco; (hbox); &quot;I'm still waitingto see how he's going to fund these programs. The programs are great. But thegovernor has to show us how he's going to do it. . . . We have to be verycareful that we don't take from one group of children and give to another. . .. The overall tone was excellent.&quot;; Senate President Pro Tem; David Roberti,;D-Los Angeles; (hbox); &quot;It's going to be tough on everybody. I think he washonest about that. We don't like the cuts, obviously, but that's a short-termproblem. I think he's talking about investing. I didn't hear anything in thespeech that would indicate he wants to cut schools below the automatic cuttingmeasures. . . .;    &quot;I think it's amazing that he's proposing anything in ayear when we're talking about cutbacks.&quot;; State schools Superintendent; BillHonig; (hbox); &quot;He said the right things in terms of bipartisanship andworking together. He addressed a wide range of issues -- perhaps too many tokeep people's attention. If he's talking about responsible revenue increases,and not just taxes like the Democrats, offset by changes in the way governmentworks, he'll have my support.&quot;; Senate Minority Leader; Ken Maddy,; R-Fresno;(hbox); &quot;He was vague about what he wants to do with AFDC, and until he'sspecific, I'm going to be vague, too. He appreciates the morality of humandevelopment. You have to invest in human lives. That's a wonderful positionfor a leader to take.&quot;; Assemblyman; John Vasconcellos,; D-San Jose; (hbox);&quot;Increasing funding for family planning services is a clear sign of supportfor this money saving program. . . . We are thrilled that this is one of thefew health programs selected by Governor Wilson for increased funding at atime when health care dollars are so hard to come by.&quot;; Norma Clevenger,;Planned Parenthood Affiliates; of California  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GARY WEBB AND THOMAS FARRAGHER, Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910110  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  2,426  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, January 10, 199100010023,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
