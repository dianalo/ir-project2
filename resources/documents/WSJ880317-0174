Mr. Bovard takes the view that farm programs are useless if they cost the taxpayer anything. He ignores other, far more important questions about farm policy.    For instance, U.S. Agriculture Department programs that encourage exports at below costs of production are in part an answer to other countries having policies of subsidizing exports of their farm products. A few years ago, France sold Egypt wheat at below-market prices. France was drowning in wheat and it needed to get wheat out of warehouses. Its low-price sale to Egypt literally stole that market from the U.S. The U.S. wheat industry was outraged. It had a surplus problem of its own. Fortunately, our wheat industry, along with the USDA, came out swinging. We went back to Egypt with a low-interest loan and various export credits and regained that market. France was furious, but we got back a market.    Concerning the Food for Peace shipments, Mr. Bovard misses the point. We couldn't be sending these shipments to underdeveloped countries if we didn't have more than our population needs. What kind of people are we if we selfishly produce only enough for our own needs and ignore the needs of the world's hungry?    Even more important than our food shipments to starving people is our country's commitment through the Foreign Agriculture Service and our land-grant universities to help teach and train people in less-developed countries how to grow their own food and feed themselves. Well-fed people put their energies elsewhere and begin to contribute positively to their families, their nations and the world.    Mr. Bovard sidesteps such social issues as whether we are willing to let economics determine where food is produced in the world or whether countries will make the social commitment to maintain an agriculture that can support their own populations. In America, we've never had a time when war or other forces caused our people to go hungry in large numbers. Countries such as France, Germany and Japan have had that experience and have vowed never to let it happen again.    All farm programs aren't bad. Without farm programs the Great Plains, now known as the breadbasket of the world, would be a desert. Farm programs encouraged landowners to plant windbreaks, build waterways and terraces, and adopt other conservation practices. Had this not been done, the soil would have continued to blow away until nothing but cactus and sagebrush would grow.    Farm programs have helped develop water-saving techniques, protect consumers from unhealthy food products, financed research projects that have led to cures for human diseases, and taught rural and urban youth useful skills as well as self-respect.    Of course, farm programs have problems -- in some cases they are downright wrong. But let's be specific and kill off only those programs that aren't working.    Jack Odle   Editor, Progressive Farmer   Birminghman, Ala.   ---   I strongly support Mr. Bovard's contention about the USDA. I have been in the tobacco business for nearly 20 years and have seen the USDA price our crops out of the world market simply by using that childish mind-set of increased price-support levels year after year. I had the radical notion of recommending that the USDA allow tobacco farmers to grow outside of their allotments for export only without any price support as a way to get back into the world market. Nothing but deaf ears.    Timothy M. Cornell   Weston, Conn.</TEXT></DOC>
