 Only this wasn't L.A.andP;  It was Phoenix.andP;  Andit wasn't raining, either.andP;  It was sprinkling.andP;  The sprinkler system splashedoccasionally against the window of my two-story condo overlooking the lush18-hole golf course on the outskirts of town.andP;  The temperature was probably72 degrees.andP;  Fahrenheit.andP;  Good tanning weather.andM;I wrote this column as a favor to my boss, Mr. Newquist, who claims to havethe flu.andP;  Anyway, I owe him a favor-maybe even my life-and I agreed to writethis column so he could go off and do what it is that AI types do whensomebody does them a favor.andP;  The name is Trends.andP;  AI Trends.andP;  I'm a privateinvestigator.andP;  Not AI, but P.I.andP;  That's P as in pun that rhymes with fun andeven none, but sounds like gun-something I carry with me at all times.andP;  Aloaded .44 Magnum that I keep handy for guys who act wise and try to pullfunny stuff, like in that last sentence.andP;  As you can see, this is a dangerousbusiness.andM;As I was sitting in the condo, which doubles as my office, getting ready towrite some thoughts about artificial sweeteners, artificial insemination, andmaybe even artificial intelligence, I heard a knock at my door.andP;  A beautifulbrunette with drop-dead legs stood on the porch.andP;  &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; Iasked in my best Dashiell Hammett voice.andM;&quot;It's what I can do for you,&quot; she said, as she pushed her way into the room.andO;&quot;I want to talk about AI in law enforcement.&quot; Obviously, she knew what I hadin mind.andP;  &quot;And I want to start by talking about DIANA.&quot;andM;Diana?&quot; I asked.andP;  &quot;As in Princess Di?&quot;andM;No,&quot; she said as she leaned nearer to me.andP;  &quot;As in 'to die for.' &quot;andM;I was getting the message.andP;  She didn't have to spell it out for me, althoughshe did have a typewritten sheet so I could follow along.andM;&quot;It's a system that Bolt Beranek andamp; Newman developed for the Home Office inthe U.K.&quot; I knew the Home Office was the official term for the U.K.'scriminal-investigation bureau.andP;  I could even see flying over to London withthis woman, but it would probably ruin us both.andP;  I'd become head of asuccessful investigation agency, she'd open her own designer eyewear shop onSaville Row.andP;  Things would be fine until our careers would collide, and oneday we'd have no time for each other.andP;  She'd run off with that Korean doormanshe'd been so friendly with lately, and I'd be despondent enough to hangmyself with my shoulder holster.andP;  Don't laugh.andP;  I must know at least 20 guysthat's happened to.andM;&quot;Did you come in here just to tell me about the smart machines over inLondon?&quot;andM;No,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;There's more.andP;  DIANA was created by BBN for the intelligentanalysis and interpretation of police intelligence data.andP;  It was acollaboration with the scientific research and development branch of the HomeOffice in London.andM;&quot;DIANA uses a pattern-matching approach to analyze the gathered data.andO;Normally, data pertaining to specific cases or police work is accumulated andthen pored over by human intelligence analysts, who make reports based ontheir study of the material.andP;  The expert system streamlines this process bymaintaining a static dynamic base while creating a new dynamic knowledge basewith each session.andP;  Objects created within the dynamic database can berepresented graphically for visual inspection by the user, who can furthermanipulate them during the course of analysis.andP;  The final results can beprinted out in hard copy,andM;&quot;BBN developed DIANA using Procyon Common LISP, one of the most popularEuropean LISPs, on a Macintosh IIx.andP;  The Macintosh was chosen as both adevelopment and delivery vehicle to put users more at ease with the initialanalysis sessions.&quot;andM;&quot;That's all very interesting, but it's not enough,&quot; I said, hoping she couldcome up with a couple more gems for this article.andP;  I wasn't disappointed.andM;&quot;Did you know that the FBI has about two dozen expert-systems projectsunderway?&quot; she asked.andP;  I had to admit that I didn't.andP;  I knew that Newquisthad referenced the &quot;Big Floyd&quot; system in an old issue of AI EXPERT Thatsystem was designed to help agents solve labor racketeering cases.andP;  &quot;The FBIuses expert systems more than other agencies, primarily because they canafford to.andP;  Their Behavioral Science Unit has constructed an expert systemthat creates personality profiles of violent criminals based on reports takenfrom crime scenes, media accounts, violent crime research findings, the modeof activity, and pattern analysis.andP;  In effect, the expert system examines allthe information about the crime and the victim and then develops its ownhypothesis about the type of person who committed the crime.andP;  This system ispart of the computerization of the National Center for the Analysis ofViolent Crime.andM;&quot;The FBI is also working on the Arson information Management System, calledAIMS.andP;  This system analyzes arsons to help determine possible futurelocations and times that might be ripe for certain arsonists to strike.&quot;andM;This fact was news to me, but so is &quot;The Today Show.&quot; &quot;What about locally,the smaller agencies like police and county sheriff's offices? They must bedoing something-expert systems are getting too affordable to ignore.&quot; I couldfeel myself starting to sweat.andM;&quot;Most city and county law enforcement agencies are just now gettingautomated, and many of them rely on data coming from national crimecomputers.andP;  Expert systems aren't at the top of their list.andP;  I think you'vegot all I've got to give,&quot; she smirked.andM;But now it was my turn.andP;  Armed with a short reference by Newquist regarding asystem in Maryland that I found in my leather-bound back issues of AI EXPERT,I asked her point blank: &quot;What about the BCPD system?&quot;andM;She stopped in her tracks.andP;  The color drained out of her face, as if she'dseen a ghost.andP;  A ghost with lots of teeth and black eyes.andP;  Like a shark.andP;  Ahuge, living, breathing nightmare of a shark.andP;  Only this shark was dead, likea ghost.andM;&quot;The residential burglary expert system you speak of was based on acrime-analysis program developed by the Devon andamp; Cornwall Constabulary inExeter and the Savant Research Center in Coventry.andP;  In May 1987, theJefferson Institute for Justice Studies was awarded grant money from the NIJto adapt the British system to use in U.S.andP;  crime investigation.andP;  Because ofits proximity to Washington, D.C., the Baltimore County Police Dept.andP;  waschosen as the test site.andP;  The delivery vehicle was a 386-based PC, and GoldHill's GoldWorks was selected as the shell for the expert system.andP;  One memberof the BCPD's crime analysis unit was chosen to assist a programmer and sentto a GoldWorks training course to prepare him for the  knowledge engineeringtasks.andP;  Are you getting all this down?&quot;andM;&quot;You bet I am,&quot; I replied.andP;  Just keep talking.&quot;andM;&quot;The initial prototype was deployed in April 1988, ahead of schedule.andP;  Atthis point, burglary detectives got their first look at the system that wouldhelp them analyze information taken from burglary sites and, they hoped, helpnarrow down initial lists of suspects.andP;  The BCPD had loaded information fromabout 300 closed burglary cases into the system, as well as 3,000 recordsabout unsolved cases and known burglars.andP;  Eighteen detectives had beeninterviewed for insights into residential burglaries, who came up with 397statements relevant to that particular type of crime, including categoricalinformation such as the characteristics of the residence, its environment,the type of entry used by the burglar, behavior at the scene, types ofmaterials taken and not taken, and possible mode of transportation to andfrom the scene.andM;&quot;The residential burglary system now runs on a Compaq 386 with 10MBs of mainmemory.andP;  It takes up about 6MBs of hard memory.andP;  The total cost for thesystem was about $21,350; plus the BCPD figures that maintenance, licensingfees, and miscellaneous expenses will cost about $4,000 more each year.andP;  I'dsay they got off pretty cheaply.&quot; She smiled and leaned back.andP;  She knew thatI knew that the BCPD system was the first AI application at the local leveland that Tucson, Charlotte, and Rochester all used it.andP;  She grasped for onemore straw.andM;&quot;What about the Green River serial killer investigation?&quot; she asked, as ifshe knew something I didn't.andP;  That was her big mistake.andM;&quot;Old news,&quot; I told her.andP;  &quot;Set up on a VAX to keep track of some psycho inSeattle who's killed at least 40 women.andP;  Developed by Information AccessSystems, the same group who is doing the system for the Colorado Bureau ofInvestigation.andP;  Once again...&quot; I let my words linger in the air, &quot;We'retalking about older systems.andP;  Although criminal investigation appears to be anatural for expert systems, they still haven't taken a hold on the areaswhere they can be most effective, like smaller agencies with limitedresources or high turnovers or minimal experience in certain types of crimes.andO;As a matter of fact, this could be one of the next major areas of developmentfor expert-system applications, right up there with transportation controland retailing.andP;  If more law enforcement agencies could use these programs,people like me might have to take up real work for a living.&quot;andM;I looked out the window, wondering how soon expert systems could be targetedto the cops on a large scale.andP;  Dreams of knowledge engineering my own finelyhoned skills whirled through my head, when I noticed her creeping up behindme with a Black andamp; Decker circular saw.andP;  Where she got it from, I'll neverknow, but a short scuffle ensued, followed by a couple of slow dances.andP;  Ibegan to realize this AI stuff was more intriguing than diesel-enginediagnostics, and resolved to seek out more exciting applications.andP;  As for themystery woman with the power saw...andM;Turns out she just couldn't cut it.andM;Harvey P.
