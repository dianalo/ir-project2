The H{sup -} ion current and polarization of such sourcescan be increased provided that the optically pumped Na charge exchangetarget density and percentage polarization can be increased. Our researchon wall surfaces with low collisional depolarization rates and on theeffects of radiation trapping on the target polarization show promisefor improved performance of optically-pumped, polarized H{sup -} ionsources.</TEXT></DOC>
