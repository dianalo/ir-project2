Theofficial did not indicate the outcome or say whether theinvestigation was continuing.   Milan Panic, ICN's chairman, denied knowledge of any such investigation. However, the company's chief administrative officer, Lawrence Panitz, said an SEC investigation exists but isn't targeting ICN. Mr. Panitz asserted that the SEC is looking into activities of PaineWebber Inc. in connection with ICN stock and debt issues underwritten by PaineWebber and E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. last July. He said ICN is cooperating with the SEC.    Mr. Panitz added that the investigation concerns a bullish report on ICN by a PaineWebber securities analyst just over three weeks after the offering. The SEC, as is its practice, wouldn't comment. The SEC official didn't mention PaineWebber.    PaineWebber declined to comment.    The PaineWebber analyst's report was issued on Aug. 12, which was 26 days after that firm and Hutton co-managed offerings of $137 million in ICN debentures and common stock. In the week following the report -- which was the first analysis of ICN by a major investment house in 12 years -- ICN stock rose 77% to close at $33.375 in New York Stock Exchange trading.    PaineWebber subsequently reassigned the analyst, Ronald Nordmann, to perform investment-banking services for ICN. Another PaineWebber analyst assigned to cover ICN downgraded the stock late in August.    In September, an ICN holder sued PaineWebber in federal court in New York, alleging undue optimism in Mr. Nordmann's projection that an ICN drug, Virazole, &quot;could become one of the largest-selling drugs in the world.&quot; The suit, which seeks class-action status, is pending.    A secretary to Mr. Nordmann said he wasn't speaking to the press.    An E.F. Hutton analyst also issued a report on ICN, on Sept. 11. That report recommended the stock, but said it carried &quot;extreme risk&quot; and was &quot;highly speculative.&quot; The Hutton analyst, Lynne Pauls, said she hadn't any knowledge of any investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
