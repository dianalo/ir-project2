Aramco said that a new study estimates Saudi Arabia's recoverablecrude oil reserves at 252.38 billion barrels. That's aboutone-fourth of the world's total known reserves and significantlyhigher than the 171.5 billion barrels previously estimated.   Aramco, based in the capital of Saudi Arabia's oil-producingeastern province, also estimated Saudi gas reserves at 177.294trillion cubic feet, up from approximately 141.80 trillion estimateda year ago.   The Aramco report, distributed by the official Saudi PressAgency, said that untapped reserves could raise the estimates to 315billion barrels of oil and 253 trillion cubic feet of gas.   By comparison, the United States has estimated oil reserves of 27billion barrels and the Soviet Union, the world's largest oilproducer, some 63 billion barrels.   The new estimates followed six years of intensive study by acomputerized engineering center in Dhahran manned by the world'slargest grouping of oil experts and engineers with the mostsophisticated equipment available, Aramco said.   Saudi Arabia and neighboring gulf countries sit on two-thirds ofthe world's oil proven reserves. Saudi Arabia is the largestproducer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries andthe world's largest oil exporter.   Other members of OPEC also recently have increased theirgovernment estimates of proven reserves in what some analysts say ispart of an ongoing power struggle within the cartel.   Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, all OPEC countries,each have reported estimated reserves of around 100 billion barrels.The amount of reserves a country has are believed to be one factorused by OPEC to establish production quotas.   The Arabic-language report did not use the word ``proven'' forthe latest estimate, but it was implied through the comparison withthe untapped resources. Proven oil reserves are those that can beproduced at current prices with current technology.   King Fahd, who is currently visiting the eastern province, lastweek chaired a cabinet meeting that ratified Saudi Arabia's 1989budget which showed a deficit for the sixth straight year because ofweak oil prices.   The kingdom drew on its reserves to cover the earlier deficits.But the dwindling coffers forced it to resort to public borrowingthrough treasury bonds of $8 billion last year and $6.7 billion thisyear.</TEXT></DOC>
