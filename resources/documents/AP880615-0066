Scientists found that an abnormal blood protein appears up toseven years before a person develops the kind of diabetes thatrequires daily insulin shots.   The protein was detectable in all 12 study subjects whodeveloped insulin-dependent diabetes from three months to sevenyears later. It also appeared in 18 of 20 newly diagnosed diabeticsbut not in any of 18 non-diabetics of similar ages, researcherssaid.   While other blood proteins have shown some ability to predictwho will get insulin-dependent diabetes, none has shown suchpromise for accuracy, said Mark Atkinson, clinical research fellowin pathology at the University of Florida College of Medicine inGainesville.   The protein may play a central role in causing the disease, andstrategies against it may be able to prevent insulin-dependentdiabetes from developing, he said in an interview before presentingthe study Tuesday at the American Diabetes Association's annualscientific sessions in New Orleans.   George Eisenbarth of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, whowas familiar with the research, said it was important because itconfirms earlier indications that blood tests based on the proteincan be used to help predict diabetes.   He also said there are other candidates for the role in causingthe disease that Atkinson suggests for the protein.   About 1 million Americans are thought to have insulin-dependentdiabetes. They need insulin shots because their bodies do notproduce insulin.   Insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas. The cellsare destroyed by insulin-dependent diabetes. The disease is thoughtto arise from a misguided attack on those cells by the body'sdisease-fighting immune system.   Nobody knows what triggers the attack, but Atkinson suggests itis carried out by the protein in his study.   The protein is an antibody, a substance created by blood cellsof the immune system to attack specific targets such asdisease-causing microbes. The antibody in Atkinson's study reactswith a protein found on the surface of the beta cells but not inother tissues examined, Atkinson said.   That fact and its early appearance are evidence that theso-called ``64K'' antibody carries out the attack reponsible forinsulin-dependent diabetes, Atkinson said.   If that is true, then sabotaging its production early in theprocess may keep the disease from developing, he said.   Scientists may be able to create samples of the protein itattacks and link it to a poison, he said. If that combination isinjected into a person with the antibody in his blood, it mightencounter and kill the blood cells reponsible for directing theimmune system attack, he said.   Scientists hope to test that soon in mice, Atkinson said.   Before such a strategy could be used for humans, researchersmust devise a simpler blood test than they have now to look for theantibody, he said.   Besides Atkinson, scientists in the study included NoelMacLaren, Lynn Holmes and William Riley at the Florida school andand David Scharp at the Washington University School of Medicine inSt. Louis.</TEXT></DOC>
