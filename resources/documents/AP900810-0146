Federal and state officials said there was no apparentcontamination of honey sold for human consumption.   Following a complaint from beekeepers on Cape Cod, officials ofthe state Department of Food and Agriculture made a routineinvestigation of bee hives in Rochester and Middleboro on July 17.They found 22 times the appropriate level of the pesticide,fluvalinate, in one honey sample. The FDA followed up with its owninvestigation.   Fluvalinate, legal for use in hives that do not produce honeyfor human consumption, is used to kill the varroa mite, which killsbees.   Because the heavily dosed honey was not for human consumption,no FDA laws were broken, said John Hamilton, the FDA's New Englanddirector of compliance.   ``We have not instituted any nationwide testing,'' Hamiltonsaid, dismissing earlier reports that honey was being tested acrossthe country.   Hamilton noted the contaminated honey was not eaten by humans;it's the bees' food.   August Schumacher, commissioner of Food and Agriculture, saidconsumers were in no danger and that his agency was ensuring thisremains the case.   ``These bees are not used to make honey for human food, they areonly used for pollination,'' Schumacher said.   The state agriculture officials received a complaint frombeekeepers on Cape Cod that migrant beekeepers were usingfluvalinate illegally.   The migrant beekeepers travel between the citrus orchards ofFlorida to the blueberry barrens of Maine, their bees pollinatingas they go.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes fluvalinateas ``low to moderately toxic.'' Made by the Sandoz Crop ProtectionCorp., it can cause skin, eye and throat irritation, the EPA said.   ``We have an ongoing investigation on the use of fluvalinate tomake sure it is properly done and that no (affected) honey is soldto the commercial markets. To the best of my knowledge, this honeyhas not entered the food chain,'' Schumacher said.   As a precaution, however, Hamilton said the FDA planned to testhoney produced by two manufacturers that used the bees from thecontaminated hive. They are Mendes Apiaries of Punta Gorda, Fla.,and W.D. Fisher Bee Farm of McVeytown, Pa., he said.   ``If that indicates a problem, we will in fact expand ourinvestigation,'' he said. ``We're not aware of any contaminatedhoney that's on the market.''   In the meantime, he said, there's no indication that consumersshould throw out their honey.</TEXT></DOC>
