The merger process &quot;has been somewhat complicated&quot; by theprice surge set off by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, saidRonald Watkins, vice president, industry and governmentrelations, for Interhome Energy Inc., Calgary, Alberta, whichowns Home Oil. &quot;Everyone has had to sit down and re-examinetheir oil price forecasts, which form the basis for valuationassumptions,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   Spot prices of West Texas Intermediate, a benchmark gradeof U.S. crude oil, have risen more than $13 a barrel sincethe invasion and subsequent trade embargo against oil andother products from Iraq and occupied Kuwait.   The Reichmanns' plan, announced in April, called for themerger of Gulf Canada Resources, a Calgary-based oil and gasproducer, and Home Oil this summer. It also sought thespinoff of Interhome's Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. unit asa separate public company by year's end.   The Reichmann family owns 74.3% of Gulf Canada through itsreal estate flagship, Toronto-based Olympia andamp; YorkDevelopments Ltd. Companies controlled by the Reichmanns,including Gulf Canada, own a combined 63.5% of Interhome.   Gulf Canada and Home Oil would have joint daily output of132,000 barrels of oil, more than any other Canadian-ownedoil producer, and assets of about five billion Canadiandollars (US$4.3 billion).   But with the Iraqi situation unresolved and the outlookfor oil prices unclear, a Gulf Canada spokesman asked, &quot;Howdo you get an agreement on price?&quot; He added that &quot;theintention now is to see if we can go ahead with this mergerbefore the end of the year.&quot; The proposed spinoff ofInterprovincial could proceed at the same time, he said.   Financial advisers are expected to submit proposed termsfor the merger next month to committees set up by Gulf Canadaand Interhome. The committees will then submit therecommendations to their respective boards. The proposedterms should be disclosed shortly thereafter, the Gulf Canadaspokesman said.   The delay in the merger won't have any direct impact onthe Reichmann family's wealth, and the merger doesn't involvethe sale of any assets to raise cash. The Reichmanns' energyassets are held separately from their vast real estateholdings.</TEXT></DOC>
