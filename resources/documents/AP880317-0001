Ross Perotcarried a letter from White House aide Oliver L. North giving himpresidential authority for transporting $100,000 to Canada as partof a plan to free a U.S. hostage in Lebanon, according to apublished report.   North sent the courier, Jay Coburn, to Canada in January 1986with a letter on National Security Council stationery that saidCoburn ``is acting on official U.S. Government business on behalfof the President of the United States,'' according to a copy of theletter obtained by The Washington Post.   ``In support of this mission he has the authority to transportand disburse as necessary, U.S. $100,000,'' the letter said. ``Inthe event of emergency or clarification, please contact: Oliver L.North.''   Perot had provided the money, at North's request, to help freePeter C. Kilburn, the librarian at the American University inBeirut who was kidnapped Dec. 3, 1984. Kilburn was killed by aLibyan terrorist group in April 1986 in apparent retaliation forthe U.S. bombing of Libya.   Coburn needed the North letter in case U.S. Customs Serviceagents stopped him at the border, the Post said in Friday'seditions. Travelers must file a disclosure statement if they takemore than $10,000 out of the country. Failure to file is punishableby up to $250,000 in fines and five years in prison.   The Post said Coburn has told associates that he filed nodisclosure statement and planned to rely on North's letter if heran into trouble at the border.   Coburn got into Canada without difficulty and in Montreal, hegave the money to a Canadian citizen who had provided proof ofcontact with Kilburn's captors. The Canadian said the $100,000 wasa down payment and that with it, he could arrange Kilburn's releasefor $1 million more, said the Post, which did not identify the man.   The Canadian contact took the money, but never came through withhis end of the deal and was later observed by the CIA in Damascus,spending the money on high living, the Post said, citingunidentified sources for the information.   The Post said that a senior FBI official has told Congress thatthen-FBI Director William H. Webster _ who is now CIA director _approved the FBI's participation in the plan. The newspaper saidthe plan also was discussed with Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   North has said repeatedly that he had express authority from hissuperiors for his actions.   However, the White House has said Reagan had no knowledge of anyefforts to ransom U.S. hostages in Lebanon.   North, who was fired from his job as an NSC aide in late 1986following revelations of the secret sales of arms to Iran and thediversion of profits from those sales to the Nicaraguan Contrarebels, was indicted Wednesday.   He was charged with conspiracy to defraud the government andcommit criminal offenses against it, theft of government propertyand wire fraud arising from the diversion of arms-sales proceeds.He was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction ofCongress, making false statements, obstructing Meese's Nov. 21-23,1986 inquiry by making false statements and concealing, falsifyingand destroying classified government documents in NSC files.   Also indicted Wednesday were former national security adviserJohn M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and AlbertHakim.</TEXT></DOC>
