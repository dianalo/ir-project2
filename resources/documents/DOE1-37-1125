When bone marrow cells were cultured forthree days with the drug, 10{sup -8} M to 10{sup -5} M of histamine stimulateddifferentiation and proliferation of myeloid precursor cells. Subsequently,the number of descendant cells, such as metamyelocytes and neutrophils,increased dose-dependently. Co-existence of equimolar H{sub 2} blockerssuch as cimetidine and ranitidine completely suppressed this effect ofhistamine, though this was not the case with an H{sub 1} blocker/histaminecombination. Significant increase in {sup 3}H-thymidine incorporationwas observed almost exclusively in myeloblasts, promyelocytes and myelocytesafter exposure to histamine at concentrations higher than 10{sup -8}M. Also, selective incorporation of {sup 3}H-histamine into bone marrowcells was observed in myeloblasts and promyelocytes, but histamine incorporationwas not influenced by the presence of either of histamine agonists ofantagonists. While histamine, via H{sub 2} receptors, selectively increasedthe number of granulocytic colony forming units in culture (CFU-C), ithad no such effect on macrophage colonies. 22 references, 5 figures,4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
