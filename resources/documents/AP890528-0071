Legislator Erich Gutjahr of the National Party of Germany (NPD)was quoted by the Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper Friday as saying``Jews are plundering us again'' and that something must be doneabout it.   The interview sparked a furor among other city legislators andthe city's Jewish community. The Frankfurt prosecutors' office saidit was investigating Gutjahr for possibly violating West Germanlaws.   Gutjahr is vacationing in Switzerland and has been unavailableto comment. But Winfried Krauss, a National Party spokesman, saidSunday he spoke with Gutjahr, who told him the newspaper report``was correct in its tenor.''   Krauss said party officials decided Gutjahr should leave theorganization and quit his city council seat as well.   Krauss also said the party ``distances itself'' from Gutjahr'sreported statements.   The National Party of Germany, which has taken harsh standsagainst permitting more refugees into West Germany, won seven citycouncil seats in local elections last March, giving it a minorityvoice in the body.</TEXT></DOC>
