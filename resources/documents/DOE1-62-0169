It was named as 'photochemical smog', because high concentrationsof oxidants were observed on the very day when this incident occurredfor the first time. Symptoms of the victims cannot be explained by photochemicalsmog of the Los Angeles type. The true cause of these incidents has beenleft officially unexplained. These incidents can be attributed to cyanidepoisoning by air pollution caused by careless treatment of cyanide wastesfrom industrial sources such as acrylonitrile and coke factories.</TEXT></DOC>
