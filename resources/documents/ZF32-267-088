Certainly, there are promoters of the medium.andP;  Probablythe most visible is Bob Abel, whose company, AND Communications in LosAngeles is responsible for producing two truly amazing interactive videodiscproducts so far.andP;  Guernica and Ulysses.andP;  Guernica is an interactiveexploration of Picasso's famous painting, which includes views of thepainting itself, of sketches that Picasso made, of photographs and videos ofthe town of Guernica both in the 1930's (when it was destroyed in a Nazi airraid) and recently, of video interviews with art experts and with people wholived in Guernica or knew Picasso.andP;  Ulysses is a similar interactiveexploration of Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem.andP;  The difference between the twois that Guernica was produced on a Macintosh using Hypercard and Supercardand Ulysses was produced on a PS/2 using IBM Linkway (although Ulysses neverwould have been produced at all, if Abel hadn't gained the experience he didin developing Guernica).andP;  Watching once of Abel's demonstrations of eitherproject is an emotional, affecting experience, because he personally uses themedium to draw you into an experience that is memorable.andP;  But a lot of peopleinvolved with videodiscs are ticked off at Abel because neither of theprojects he has produced can be distributed.andP;  He has failed to gainpermission from the Picasso estate to distribute the Guernica disc (althoughthe rights are fuzzy, since the painting itself hangs in the Prado inMadrid).andP;  And IBM financed the development of Ulysses as a demonstrationproject not for commercial distribution.andP;  So, for all the attention that Abelhas brought to the medium, he hasn't produced anything marketable.andM;If marketability is the key test for turning the medium into a business, thenI would have to elect ABC News Interactive as the prime candidate for turninginteractive videodisc into a real business.andP;  This special operation insideABC's news department has been quietly chunking out one videodisc afteranother for the past nine months.andP;  The first was The '88 Vote, an expositionof the 1988 presidential campaign presided over by Ted Koppel.andP;  The nextthree tides were In The Holy Land, moderated by Ted Koppel, which is aninteractive look at the conflict in the Middle East, based on severaldocumentaries ABC has already produced but using footage that was never shownof children and adults from both sides of the conflict talking about how theyfeel about the conflict and each other; The Great Quake of  89 moderated byDiane Sawyer and featuring both network and camcorder footage of the BayArea's latest natural disaster, and Martin Luther King Jr., which is anamazing tour of the great man's life and times through his confrontationswith the police and his public speeches.andP;  ABC News has two new titles, one onAIDS and one on going to the moon, almost ready for delivery.andP;  The AIDS diskis particularly affecting, since it features original interviews with RyanWhite (the boy from the Midwest who recently died from AIDS) and otherstalking about how they felt when they found out they had the disease and howthey reacted to the news.andP;  Much of the disk is a very straight, crediblediscussion of the disease, including how it is spread and how to deal withpeople who have it, presented by former Surgeon General Everett Koop.andM;ABC News Interactive was set up primarily as a way to redevelop ABC's libraryof footage (both televised and not televised) into interactive products foruse in schools as educational material.andP;  But interest has been great enoughthat the group is experimenting with other distribution, including havingVoyager resell some of the disks.andP;  What's really clear, though, is that theABC News Interactive group, which is made up of news people drawn from theoperations of the ABC News, have both been personally affected and motivatedby the experience of producing the discs and have realized that they arepioneers of a new medium.andP;  So the energy level going into production of thediscs is extremely high, and clearly affects both the ABC News people thatget involved as well as the computer people that the Interactive group dealswith.andM;I don't think it's a stretch at all to say that the feeling I get fromdealing with people working on interactive videodiscs is all that differentfrom the feeling I got from dealing with people working on productivitysoftware in the early 1980s.andP;  And that makes interactive videodisc one veryinteresting business.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
