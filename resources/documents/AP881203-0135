Amiram Nir, the former Israeli official who died in a crash inMexico on Wednesday, told the Post last summer that the agreementauthorized still-secret operations that he and North supervised in1985-86, the newspaper said.   The Post said American and Israeli sources confirmed theexistence of the Israeli-American agreement, referred to as ``termsof reference'' or ``accords'' by some knowledgeable sources. Thepaper said the agreement never was disclosed to Congress.   Nir, who served as an adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeliprime ministers, maintained that the secret U.S.-Israeli covertoperations were authorized by an agreement signed by PresidentReagan and then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said the Post.Other sources said the agreement was signed at a lower level in thetwo governments, the newspaper said.   Although few details of these operations have been disclosed, thepaper said, Nir said the Israeli government has detailed records ofall of them.   The Post said one operation conducted under the agreement was theorganizing of an armed force of Lebanese Druze in Beirut in May1986, at a time when the White House was considering the use offorce to try to free American hostages in Lebanon.   As described by Nir, the agreement led to a series of covertactions that had common tactical elements, according to the Post.The secret transactions that led to the diversion of U.S.-Iran armssales profits to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua may have fit apattern established in those undertakings, the newspaper said.   Nir was interviewed by Post reporter Bob Woodward on June 25 andJune 26 in London, with an agreement that none of the informationwould be attributed to him without further discussions, thenewspaper said.   Nir told the Post in October that he still was not ready to ``gopublic'' with the information, the newspaper said. It said Posteditors concluded that Nir's death removed the reasons for theagreement to withhold attribution of the information he had provided.   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, declined comment on thestory.   Officials at the Israeli Embassy were unavailable for commentlate Saturday. But embassy spokesman Yossi Gal told the Post: ``Iwon't go into this agreement. ... Israel and the United States havelots of agreements. ... Everything he (Nir) did was being done bythe government of Israel.''   Nir told the Post that Israel had assembled extensive records,based in part on his detailed notes and papers, that were not turnedover the United States. The records provide point-by-pointdocumentation of all contacts, discussions and undertakings withU.S. officials, including North, Nir said.   Nir said he also provided full written reports to his superiorsand gave oral briefings to Peres, the Israeli prime minister whohired him, and later to Peres' successor, Yitzhak Shamir.   North, who is under indictment in the Iran-Contra case, suggestedduring testimony heard by U.S. congressional investigators that theplan to divert money to the Contras was Nir's idea. Israel deniedthat.   The agreement is among the classified documents that North'slawyers are seeking to introduce into evidence at the former WhiteHouse aide's trial, the Post said, citing an unidentified source. Itsaid North's lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan, declined to comment.   Nir was an important liaison in the secret arms deals, accordingto testimony before the congressional investigators. His activitiesincluded trips to Iran and Western Europe.   He was sought for questioning by independent counsel Lawrence E.Walsh, but Israel insisted that he be granted immunity fromprosecution.</TEXT></DOC>
