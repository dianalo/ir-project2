Magnetic resonance detected all adrenaland ectopic lesions. Metaiodobenzylguanidine scans had two false-negativeresults. Computed tomography missed an ectopic lesion that was associatedwith bilateral medullar hypertrophy and had a false-positive result (acortical nonhyperfunctioning adenoma). In our opinion MR may replaceboth CT and nuclear scans in the work up of Sipple disease.</TEXT></DOC>
