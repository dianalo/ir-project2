The residential and commercial real estate concern named Craig S. Manske office division partner; R. Mark Saviers, industrial division partner; and Timothy Barrett, retail division partner. They will report to Jon Hammes, whose appointment as the company's Midwest regional partner was announced earlier.    The appointments were announced during a meeting yesterday in Chicago of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks.    Trammell Crow officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment, and it wasn't known whether the company plans to announce appointments for the remaining four positions.    The Dallas-based company, which has grown tenfold in 10 years, began a corporate restructuring a year ago that has consolidated and streamlined the company's far-flung operations. Some regional partners, however, have felt the restructuring is too constrictive. Allan J. Hamilton, a partner, and the eight Chicago office managers resigned, in part citing the restructuring; one of the managers has since changed his mind and has rejoined the company.    In March, Mr. Hamilton, John Wauterlek and Ronald C. Lunt, three of the partners who resigned, filed suit against Trammell Crow, alleging the company breached its fiduciary duty in the company's restructuring.    Four partners in San Francisco, including Ned Speaker, another regional manager, indicated in March that they are considering leaving the company, possibly as early as next year, although the San Francisco managers didn't indicate they were considering leaving because of the restructuring. </TEXT></DOC>
