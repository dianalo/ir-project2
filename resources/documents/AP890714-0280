Boone Pickens said Fridaythe best thing Congress can do to promote the U.S. natural gasindustry is to keep its hands off.   ``Energy policy to some is for Congress to give a tariff onimported oil. This I am against _ that is not an energy policy,''Pickens told a conference on natural gas.   ``My message to our leaders in Washington is this: Thanks fordecontrol of natural gas. Now leave the industry alone. We can takecare of ourselves,'' he said.   Pickens spoke at a two-day symposium on natural gas at theUniversity of Southern California that ended Friday. The conferencedrew legislators, environmentalists, scientists and energy industryexperts.   Pickens, founder and chief executive officer of Mesa PetroleumCo., said demand for gas is lagging far behind available supply,making it a bargain alternative to oil-based fuels.   ``That's good news for energy security and the environment.That's not good news for the producers _ like me,'' he said.   Pickens said the price of natural gas would have to double fromcurrent levels to be as costly as oil. But oversupply has put a stopto exploratory drilling, he said.   Mesa, based in Amarillo, Texas, bolstered its natural gasinvestment before the petroleum market began to sour in 1986. Since1985, Mesa has doubled its natural gas reserve base to an estimated2.85 trillion cubic feet, Pickens said.   Texas Railroad Commissioner John Sharp said California's marketpotential could pull the Texas petroleum industry out of a slump.   He said projects in California could bring Texas more than $3billion in sales revenue in the next five years.   ``We're in a downturn because of the oil crash, but we believenatural gas is going to become our golden goose,'' Sharp said.   Sharp said he, California Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown, Jr.and Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., had agreed to form a panel toconsult with state legislators nationwide to draft a national cleanair plan relying on natural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
