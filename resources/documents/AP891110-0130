(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A court-approved agreement permits a gundealer to sell to police officers a $1.7 million shipment ofsemiautomatic rifles impounded under a Bush administration ban ninemonths ago.   Gun South Inc.'s shipment of 1,252 Steyr AUG-SA semiautomaticrifles was seized by Customs at the Birmingham airport in March,leading to one of the first court challenges to the governmentmoratorium on imports of such weapons.   Under the agreement approved Thursday by U.S. District JudgeWilliam Acker, the dealer can sell the impounded rifles, plus 3,000more Steyrs awaiting shipment Austria, but the sales can be madeonly to officers or law enforcement agencies. The dealer hadplanned to sell them to hunters.   ``I'm glad it's all over. Our legal bill is astronomical,'' saidGun South owner Don Wood. He said Friday the rifles sell for $1,375each. He said he cannot order more of the rifles because of theban, which remains on the books.   The agreement cancels a Nov. 21 trial of Gun South's lawsuitchallenging the ban.   James C. Barton, a lawyer for Gun South, said he is convincedthe Trussville company has the right under law to import freely anynumber of Steyr rifles and sell them to anyone, but the financialburden required a settlement.   Gun South, sole U.S. importer and distributor of Steyrs, orderedand committed to pay for the two shipments months before the Bushadministration announced a temporary ban on imports ofsemiautomatic rifles in March.   The ban came in response to public outcry over use of assaultrifles in crimes, including the shooting at a school in Californiain January.   The Customs Service impounded the first Gun South shipment atthe airport before Gun South could pick it up, and the company wentto court seeking an order to release the guns.   Gun South argued the gun was not an assault rifle and hadreceived government approval for importation previously as suitablefor hunting.</TEXT></DOC>
