IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/17/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> GENEVA, Switzerland  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to push oil prices to $18 a barrel faced its toughest challenge yesterday as Iraq continued to refuse to join a pact to cut production.    Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, who initially proposed the $18 price and is its current champion, held conversations in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, with Iraq's foreign minister, Tarik Aziz. But in Geneva, Iraq's oil minister said his country will accept only parity with Iran in production quotas. &quot;We will accept nothing less than (Iran's quota), barrel for barrel,&quot; Qassem Taqi al-Urabi said in an interview.    Iran's current production quota stands at 2.3 million barrels a day. Iraq hasn't had a production quota since August, when it was released from any obligation to join in OPEC's attempt to restrict production. Previously, Iraq had a much smaller production quota of only 1.2 million barrels a day.    The Iraqi stand casts doubt on chances that this conference will succeed in further limiting OPEC's output to push oil prices up.    Oil markets reacted to the developments. In New York, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the most abundantly traded U.S. crude, fell 25 cents a barrel to $16.10 a barrel.    World oil prices had been climbing steadily since Friday on optimism at this OPEC conference. They moved up Monday when 12 of the 13 OPEC members, with only Iraq dissenting, had agreed to cut output by about 1.2 million barrels a day, to 15.8 barrels a day. The assumption here was that Iraq somehow would go along with the agreement.    But Iraq, which has been at war with Iran for seven years, balked at continued attempts to gain its support for an accord.    As OPEC's plenary session was postponed for further consultations, sources said Saudi Arabia is emerging as the real victim of the impasse, squeezed between Iraq's recalcitrance and Saudi Arabia's own commitment to raise oil prices.    &quot;The king's honor is tied to this agreement,&quot; said one OPEC minister, who asked not to be identified. He pointed out that this meeting, coming so soon after the king's dismissal of Ahmed Zaki Yamani as oil minister, must be a success, or it might show his firing to have been a mistake.    In a follow-up to Mr. Yamani's ouster, the Saudi government yesterday dismissed Abdelhadi Taher as governor of Petromin, its national petroleum company. The move came as a surprise to Mr. Taher, who arrived in Geneva last night to meet with the Saudis' acting oil minister Hisham Nazer.    Referring to the king's dilemma, the OPEC minister said, &quot;On one hand, the Iraqis won't let (King Fahd) have (an agreement) until they get something from him-either more money or more free oil.&quot;    Saudi Arabia and Kuwait already give Iraq some 300,000 barrels of oil a day to sell in lieu of support for its war effort against Iran.    As for Iran's position, the source went on to say, it sees in the king's commitment to higher prices an opportunity to end the favored treatment Iraq has received through its freedom from production limits. &quot;Iran is counting on the fact that its chief enemies, who are Iraq and Kuwait in this meeting, won't stand up to King Fahd's wishes.&quot;    Thus, OPEC found itself wrapped up yesterday in a political intrigue. A further complication is the limited freedom to negotiate accorded by Riyadh to Mr. Nazer, its chief representative in this meeting. Mr. Nazer said that when it became clear the impasse was unresolvable after two days of private talks without a plenary meeting, he would refer the matter to King Fahd.    OPEC said it will remain in session while waiting for King Fahd's answer after his talks with Iraq's foreign minister. The biggest incentive to continuing these talks is that the agreed production cut could boost prices significantly. By contrast, a failure to adopt that accord would send prices skidding toward $10 a barrel, many analysts say. </TEXT></DOC>
