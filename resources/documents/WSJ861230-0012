Garcia</HL><DD> 12/30/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock market speculators expecting a rally in the last three trading sessions of the year missed their bets yesterday, as prices sagged in light trading.    The bulls lost out to a slew of negative influences: Bond prices sagged and short-term interest rates moved up; the dollar hit a six-year low against the mark; and crude oil prices were driven higher in a continuing bullish reaction to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' recent agreement to curtail production.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18.28 to 1912.12. Absent higher bond prices or the strength in many blue-chip issues that had pushed the market higher late last week, the industrial index began the session on a weak note. After a weak afternoon rally attempt fizzled, several small sell programs tied to stock-index futures intensified the average's decline late in the day.    &quot;It wasn't a pretty picture out there at all,&quot; said Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.    The broad market was also weak. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange overwhelmed gainers nearly 3 to 1. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.25 to 244.67, and the Big Board composite index lost 1.25 to 139.89.    Volume totaled 99.8 million shares, hardly brisk but well ahead of Friday's numbing pace of 48.9 million shares.    Although volume was light, traders and analysts were surprised to see share prices decline. Traditionally, they said, stock prices tend to move up in the last few days of the year as portfolio managers do a little year-end &quot;window dressing&quot; -- adding the best-performing stocks to their portfolios and weeding out the dogs.    But lower bond prices, a lower dollar and higher crude oil prices &quot;aren't healthy for stock valuations,&quot; said Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in New York. He speculated that the weakness in the dollar might force the Federal Reserve to nudge up interest rates to support the currency and keep foreign investors interested in dollar-denominated securities. In the past two years, foreigners have been big buyers of U.S. bonds and stocks.    Higher crude oil prices raise concerns about inflation, always a nasty prospect for stocks, added Mr. Peroni. The February contract for light crude rose 38 cents to $17.65 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    Oil stocks ended mixed. Exxon fell 3/4 to 72 3/4, Texaco eased 1/8 to 35 3/4, Standard Oil lost 1/4 to 49 1/2 and Amoco fell 1 1/4 to 66. But Pennzoil gained 7/8 to 66 3/4, Shell Transport rose 3/8 to 57 3/4 and Chevron inched up 1/8 to 45 7/8.    But the higher energy prices hurt airline and other transportation issues. The Dow Jones Transportations Average fell 6.42 to 813.23.    Among the airlines, Delta Air Lines lost 3/4 to 48 1/2, NWA lost 5/8 to 61 3/4, UAL fell 5/8 to 53 1/2 and AMR fell 3/4 to 54.    Merck, which gained 12 1/8 points last week, fell 4 to 125 yesterday on volume of 729,800 shares. Other drug stocks, which had been among good performers during this sluggish holiday period, also weakened.    Pfizer lost 1 3/8 to 61 1/2; Bristol-Myers dropped 1 3/8 to 83 5/8; Syntex eased 5/8 to 58; Abbott Laboratories declined 3/4 to 47 1/4; Upjohn dropped 1 1/2 to 94 1/4; Squibb gave up 2 1/4 to 116; Warner-Lambert slid 1 1/4 to 58 7/8; and Eli Lilly lost 1/4 to 75.    Chrysler eased 3/8 to 38 1/8. Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said in an interview that the auto maker isn't counting on gaining market share in the next few years but hopes that sales of upscale models will boost profit margins. He said the company expects earnings of at least $1 billion annually for the rest of the decade.    General Motors fell 3/8 to 66 3/4 in light trading. The company said its car sales in Europe rose 5.4% this year, but its market share slipped to 11% in 1986 from about 11.3% in 1985. Ford slipped 1/4 to 57 3/8.    Most retailing stocks, weak last week as investors and analysts worried about sluggish sales, failed to bounce back yesterday although Christmas sales finally met or even beat most retailers' modest goals. A last-minute surge in consumer spending did the trick, but retailers said it wasn't a spectacular Christmas season.    Federated Department Stores fell 1 3/8 to 83 7/8; Sears eased 1/8 to 40 1/2; J.C. Penney dropped 1 3/4 to 72 1/2; K mart was unchanged at 44; and May Department Stores rose 1/8 to 35 3/4.    Allied-Signal fell 1 5/8 to 40 1/4 as 352,200 shares changed hands. A story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal reported that 18 months after Allied acquired Signal Cos., Allied hasn't realized many of the gains envisioned in the merger.    AccuRay jumped 5 to 39 1/2 in over-the-counter trading on news that Hercules agreed to acquire the company for $40 a share. Hercules dropped 1 1/8 to 52 3/8 on the Big Board.    Pandick fell 1/2 to 25 1/4 on more than 1.3 million shares. The company said a $25.50-a-share leveraged buyout offer by FP Acquistion, a group that includes members of Pandick's senior management, apparently succeeded.    Early yesterday a unit of Service Resources announced that it planned to begin a tender offer for Pandick at $28 a share and that it was asking a Delaware court to block the management buyout. But late in the afternoon, the Service Resources unit said that the court had denied its motion to enjoin the management buyout and that it was dropping its offer plans and would tender its Pandick shares to FP Acquisition. Service Resources rose 1/4 to 14 3/4.    Borg-Warner eased 1/8 to 39 1/4 in light trading. Bear Stearns has granted Minstar an option to buy 970,800 additional Borg-Warner shares. If exercised, the option would give Minstar a 12.4% stake in the company. Borg-Warner has ignored a proposal from Minstar's Irwin Jacobs to acquire Borg-Warner for $43 to $48 a share.    SmithKline Beckman fell 1/4 to 93 3/4. The company accepted about 12,632,000 of its shares under a $96-a-share buyback plan. In announcing the plan late last month, SmithKline said it planned to buy five million to 15 million shares at a price between $86 and $96 each.    Purolator rose 7/8 to 27 7/8. The company agreed last Wednesday to sell its Canadian unit to Toronto-based Onex Capital for $170 million.    In the OTC market, the Nasdaq OTC composite fell 1.98 to 348.03 as volume exceeded yesterday's Big Board turnover. A total of 102,022,000 shares changed hands, compared with 44 million Friday. There were 831 issues advancing and 1,294 declining. </TEXT></DOC>
