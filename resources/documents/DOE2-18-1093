<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-1093 </DOCNO><TEXT>The non-linear evolution of stimulated Raman scattering by coupling ofthe SRS-driven Langmuir waves to ion acoustic waves is studied numerically,in a homogeneous density laser-irradiated plasma. The coupled wave amplitudebehaviour is represented either by envelope equations or by completewave-like equations. The various physical phenomena which are involvedare described. This preliminary work has been presented at the 17th AnomalousAbsorption Conference, held in last May, in Lake Tahoe City (USA).</TEXT></DOC>
