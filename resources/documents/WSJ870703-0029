Robins Co. didn't announce its response to Rorer Group Inc.'s $2.6 billion merger offer by the deadline of 6 p.m. EDT yesterday that Rorer had set.    But sources said representatives of the two health care-products companies met throughout the day and that the Robins board convened at 6:10 p.m. EDT. There were indications that Rorer had extended the deadline again by then and was willing to wait for the board's reply.    Earlier this week, Ft. Washington, Pa.-based Rorer pushed back the original deadline to give Robins directors more time to consider the bid. Negotiators for the two companies have met several times during the week to discuss the terms, which include a stock swap and a plan for ending Robins's protracted Chapter 11 bankrupcty-law proceedings. </TEXT></DOC>
