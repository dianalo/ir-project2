It establishes, too, that some folks who give fish their ordinarynames _ their street names, you might say _ would not make it in thepublic relations business.   Not as long as they insist on applying the name longnosedpigfaced bream to a fish that's marketed under the noble nameemperor.   And not if they insist on calling the grunt the brown sweetlips.Or calling the anchovy the smig. Or the grenadier the rattail.   Just off the government's presses is ``The Fish List: FDA Guideto Acceptable Market Names for Food Fish Sold in InterstateCommerce.''   It is a compilation of the market names that the governmentaccepts for imported and domestically available fish sold for humanconsumption.   The booklet was published jointly by the Food and DrugAdministration and the Commerce Department's National MarineFisheries Service, chiefly to help the industry comply with the lawthat requires that a species of fish be marketed under a consistent,national name no matter what the locals might call it.   Take rockfish.   ``People in the mid-Atlantic area call striped bass rockfish,''said Mary Snyder, assistant to the director of the Division ofRegulatory Guidance at the FDA, one of the compilers of ``The FishList.''   ``To the rest of the country the rockfish is a completelydifferent fish,'' she said. ``It is related to ocean perch, which isa rough looking fish _ squatty and with rough scales and spinnyfins. What we here in the Washington area call a rockfish iscigar-shaped, has stripes and is very different.''   Labeling fish uniformly is important because laissez faire namingcan lead to deception. About a month ago, the government seized45,672 pounds of frozen fish fillets imported from New Zealand. Theyarrived labeled orange roughy, a tasty, expensive fish, when in factthey were merely the smooth oreo dory, a cheaper fish.   The government gives fishmongers a choice. They can sell fishunder the government-assigned market name or under the common name,often an English translation of the scientific name given fish byichthyologists.   Thus what some people call the Boston mackerel and others callthe caballa, but which has the scientific name Scomber scombrus, canbe sold simply as mackerel, its government-approved market name, oras Atlantic mackerel, its science-accepted common name.   ``The Fish List'' was published because fish dealers who calledthe government to raise fish name questions sometimes gotinconsistent answers.   The book lists 24 species of croaker, 38 of snapper, 18 of eel,62 of rockfish, 31 of grouper, 15 of grunt, 21 of anchovy, 34 ofshark, and 21 of mackerel (some of which may also be sold as jackmackerel, chub mackerel, king mackerel, snake mackerel or asJapanese scad, Inca scad or rough scad).   When consumers buys anchovy, they may be getting Anchoa mitchill(common scientific name: bay anchovy) one time, Engraulis mordax(northern anchovy) another time and Anchoa compressa (deepbodyanchovy) a third time.   No matter, said Mrs. Snyder. They can all be sold as just plainanchovy because they are so similar in taste and appearance that theconsumer wouldn't know the difference. Only another anchovy couldtell for sure.   ``The Fish List'' lists only fish used by people as food, notpets. No guppies included. No goldfish, either, even though collegestudents once had the custom of eating them whole, raw, live and wet.</TEXT><TEXT>   The 50-page Fish List may be purchased for $2.75 from theSuperintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,Washington, D.C. 20402.
