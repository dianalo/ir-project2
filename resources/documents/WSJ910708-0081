The numbers in local holding camps are swelling daily, andthe British colony's government is coming under renewedcommunity pressure to stop Vietnamese from landing and tostart forcing those who do to return home. According togovernment statistics, nearly 13,000 Vietnamese haveillegally entered Hong Kong this year, a 450% jump from thesame period in 1990.</LP><TEXT>   Hong Kong government officials had hoped to reduce theinflux of boat people by introducing a screening process inJune 1988 that would divide Vietnamese into two groups: thosewith legitimate claims of political persecution and thoseseeking economic opportunity. The former group would beeligible for resettlement in a third country; the latterwould be subject to voluntary or mandatory repatriation.   The policy was adopted when Hong Kong officials decideddiplomatic efforts to solve the problem were unavailing. Theplan's architects said it would allow Hong Kong to uphold itsobligation to protect human rights while effectivelydeterring economic opportunists from leaving Vietnam.   Although the policy -- particularly the issue of forcedrepatriation -- at first sparked international protests, ayear after its introduction it won the support of allcountries in the Asian-Pacific region providing Vietnamesewith first-asylum rights and came to be known as theComprehensive Plan of Action, or CPA. Some of thosegovernments now believe the CPA has helped reduce the numberof new arrivals in their countries.   Hong Kong officials, however, believe there are otherreasons for the drop in arrivals elsewhere, and the principalone is a renewed surge in Vietnamese coming to the colony. Atthe heart of the problem, local officials say, is U.S.resistance to the forcible repatriation of Vietnamese whofail to qualify for political-refugee status. (Vietnam alsoopposes forcible repatriation.) The U.S. supports onlyvoluntary repatriation.   Since March 1989, 7,298 Vietnamese have willingly returnedhome from Hong Kong. Now, around 6,000 refugees are awaitingresettlement in a third country, having arrived beforescreening started or having been screened and judged to begenuine refugees. Close to 54,000 remain in local camps, withsome hoping the screening process will gain them resettlementand others living under the illusion that a diplomaticbreakthrough will lead to a general amnesty.   Hong Kong officials contend that without Washington'sbacking for mandatory repatriation, such illusions willpersist and the CPA will remain little more than a hollowthreat. The CPA &quot;appeared to be working in 1990 when we sawfewer new arrivals,&quot; says Clinton Leeks, refugee coordinatorfor the Hong Kong government. But &quot;we weren't acting upon thecentral objective of getting people to return to Vietnam. Nowwe have a record batch of new arrivals.&quot;   The number of boat people leaving Vietnam has declined inrecent years, from 76,000 in 1989 to 31,000 last year and anestimated 20,000 in 1991. Yet, of those who are fleeing theircountry, 97% are expected to choose Hong Kong as theirpreferred destination this year.   Although experts have no precise explanation for why theBritish colony is so popular among Vietnamese, &quot;apparentlyit's cheaper and safer to get here than anywhere else,&quot; saysRobert Van Leeuwen, chief of mission for the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR.   Refugee watch groups point to mistreatment of boat peopleelsewhere as another reason for the large number of arrivalsin Hong Kong this year. Malaysia, for example, has toughenedits stance in recent months by intercepting and turning awayboat people entering its waters. Tales of pirate attacks offthe coast of Thailand and the hazards of crossing longstretches of open sea to reach the Philippines are furtherreasons for charting a course to the British colony.   Organized smuggling rackets between Hong Kong and Vietnamalso contribute to the trend by providing passage for aslittle as $50, according to a UNHCR official. Hong Konggovernment officials concede that they know little about theoperations and that efforts to crack down on the rackets haveproduced few clues and fewer arrests.   Meanwhile, colony and refugee officials recognize that theweakness of their own deterrent, the threat of mandatoryrepatriation, means that many Vietnamese will continue totarget Hong Kong in the hope of a general amnesty or in thebelief that they have fair odds of qualifying as politicalrefugees.   &quot;It's probably the best national lottery going,&quot; saysUNHCR's Mr. Van Leeuwen. &quot;They might see a one-in-threechance of being screened in and consider this good odds.&quot; Infact, just one in six of those arriving this year areexpected to be eligible for political-refugee status.   The plight of the boat people wasn't always so dire. Forthose fortunate enough to arrive safely in Hong Kong prior tothe first half of 1988, resettlement in the U.S., Canada ormany parts of Europe was almost certain. But when a largerproportion of what were believed to be economic migrantsbegan showing up in Hong Kong during the mid-1980s, countriesbegan rethinking their resettlement policies.   Refugee workers concede that today's Vietnamese immigrantis more likely to be searching for a job than fleeingpolitical persecution. Analysts say tens of thousands ofworkers returning to Vietnam in recent months after workingin eastern Europe or the Middle East are finding an economywracked by high inflation and unemployment. The U.S. tradeembargo and an end to Soviet economic aid are contributing tothe problem, the analysts say.   More recently, a poor harvest in northern Vietnam isthought to be a leading cause of this year's exodus. &quot;We'reseeing a higher percentage of poor northern Vietnamese thisyear than in years past,&quot; says the UNHCR's Mr. Van Leeuwen.   Observers say misinformation and rumors haven't helped thesituation. &quot;There was one rumor that a U.S. ship waspreparing to enter the Gulf of Tonkin to pick up any boatpeople they happened upon,&quot; says Mr. Van Leeuwen. &quot;It'samazing what people are willing to believe. The moment onerumor dies out, another one creeps up.&quot;   Other information gleaned from Vietnamese publications,Voice of America broadcasts or hearsay often is misconstrued,experts say. After the Persian Gulf War, for instance, U.S.Representative Robert Dornan suggested that Vietnameseimmigrants held in Hong Kong detention camps be employed torebuild Kuwait. &quot;From interviews with recent arrivals, weknow his comments had a major impact,&quot; Mr. Van Leeuwen says.   Mark Beukema, Vietnamese program coordinator for Save theChildren, says his staff tries to quash rumors circulating inthe camps by translating local press articles about therefugee problem into Vietnamese or holding meetings to relaycorrect information. &quot;Rumors of a general amnesty arepersistent. Such hope fuels resistance toward voluntaryrepatriation,&quot; Mr. Beukema says.   In Vietnam, the UNHCR is carrying out its own campaign toinform people of the pitfalls of illegally leaving thecountry. Besides revealing the squalor of camp life in HongKong and other host countries in the region, the group isoffering information on legal alternatives for emigration.</TEXT></DOC>
