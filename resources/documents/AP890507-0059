Gorbachev.   ``The U.S. needs to proceed cautiously, conservatively ... andmake certain we are not dealing with a temporary aberration inSoviet behavior,'' Cheney said in an interview on the ABC-TVprogram ``This Week with David Brinkley.''   Cheney, addressing various aspects of U.S. strategic policy,said the administration:   _Refuses to negotiate with the Soviets on the withdrawal ofshort-range nuclear weapons from Europe, because it is firstnecessary to eliminate the 2-to-1 Warsaw Pact edge in conventionalforces. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose party faces atough election next year, has been urging Washington to open suchtalks.   _Will encourage development of democratic governments inSoviet-controlled Eastern Europe.   _Places great hope in the eventual development of Star Warsdefenses, although it reduced the budget requested for theStrategic Defense Initiative from President Reagan's proposal of$5.8 billion to $4.6 billion next year.   Cheney sparked a debate in Washington last week by predictingthat Gorbachev's reforms would fail and that he would be replacedby someone more hostile to the West.   That observation, repeated three times over the course of aweek, prompted President Bush and Secretary of State James A. BakerIII to declare that they hoped Gorbachev's reforms would succeed.   Cheney said Sunday that he thought his remarks ``gotoverplayed.''   Even so, full details of the new administration policy towardMoscow remained unclear.   Baker was expected to disclose the administration's arms controlstance this week during a visit to Moscow. In a speech last week,Baker echoed Cheney's cautious attitude, noting that ``the Sovietscontinue to pose a significant military threat to Westerninterests.''   Cheney said Sunday that ``the key emphasis on arms control inEurope ought to be on conventional force reductions _ that theSoviets retain an overwhelming conventional superiority.''   He ruled out talks on short-range nuclear missiles before theconclusion of ongoing conventional arms talks, in which both sideshave proposed sharp cuts that would end Soviet-bloc numericalsuperiority in tanks and troops in Central Europe.   ``We do not foresee a set of circumstances in which you wouldhave U.S. troops deployed in Western Europe, where you would notalso have as a significant component of deterrence, nuclear weapons_ short-range nuclear forces. That's a fact of life,'' said Cheney.   In related developments, two leading Democrats in Congress andthe chief arms control aide to then-President Reagan urged the Bushadministration to take a more flexible approach in negotiating withthe Soviets.   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Aspin,D-Wis., urged the administration to consider ``mandate talks'' withthe Soviets to decide how to deal with the issue of short-rangenuclear missiles in Europe.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said he did not think ``we cansustain the position that we will not negotiate on the short-rangenuclear weapons.'' Hamilton proposed that any reductions be linkedto cuts in Soviet conventional forces.   Paul Nitze, who served as Reagan's senior arms control adviser,said he did not see how the West German government could agree tothe dual policy of the Bush administration, urging modernization ofthe short-range Lance missile while refusing to enter talks withthe Soviets on that class of weapons.   Aspin and Nitze both appeared on ABC-TV. Hamilton appeared onthe NBC-TV show, ``Meet the Press.''  </TEXT></DOC>
