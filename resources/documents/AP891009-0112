The proposal joined France with many environmental groupsopposed to the view of the United States, which seeks controlleduse of the remote continent's vast mineral resources.   ``The Antarctic is at the heart of the debate on theenvironment,'' Rocard told delegates from 39 nations which signedthe 1959 Antarctic Treaty.   Delegates to the 10-day Paris meeting will review the treaty,which preserved the vast, icy continent as a place for peacefulscientific cooperation.   Representatives of the World Wide Fund for Nature and theAntarctic and Southern Oceans Coalition, an umbrella group of 200environmental groups, said Monday negotiations should be held onestablishing the first World Park, or international wildernessreserve, on the continent's 5.5 million square miles.   Rocard and Bob Hawke, prime minister of Australia, announced inAugust they would sponsor a proposal to designate Antarctica aprotected, international wilderness park. Such a reserve wouldpermanently ban mineral exploitation and control all forms of humanactivity on the continent, which is twice the size of Australia andalmost entirely encased in ice.   The French premier said the proposal is rooted in a fundamentalbelief in the ``right of future generations to inherit from us aplanet that is still fit to live in.'' It has gained support fromBelgium, Italy, India and other countries.   Leading the other side are the United States, New Zealand, Japanand Chile, which back the Wellington Convention, a 1988 accord thatis six nations short of the required unanimous approval of the 39Antarctic Treaty members. It seeks to protect the environment byallowing mineral exploitation under strict controls.   Its supporters argue that a legal framework regulating mining isbetter than the voluntary moratorium that has existed until now.The minerals accord also ``establishes environmental principleswhich are very important,'' said Tucker Scully, head of the U.S.delegation, in an interview before the conference.   However, Rocard told delegates that Antarctica's ``purity issuch that it is an irreplaceable site for observing the ozone layerand the changes taking place in the atmosphere.''   In August, a New Zealand team reported the ozone hole overAntarctica was much larger than previously believed. Their workraised questions about whether the world's protective ozone layerwas disintegrating more rapidly than believed earlier, exposinghuman beings to dangerous radiation.   Rocard called on delegates to hold a special meeting next yearto ``work on a comprehensive program for protecting Antarcticawhich, in my view, should take the form of a nature reserve.''   At a news conference after Rocard's speech, Jacques Cousteau,the French underwater explorer, said President Francois Mitterrandhad asked him to help develop the French position on Antarctica.   Cousteau, who has collected more than 1 million signatures on apetition to declare Antarctica a world park, said the United Stateswas ``wasting its time defending a lost cause'' in arguing formineral exploitation.   Earlier in the day, at Paris studios of the American networkNBC, Cousteau refused to yield his seat to Scully, preventing theU.S. delegate from presenting the American view on the ``Today''show.   During their meetings, the delegates will discuss controllinghazardous waste, extending areas designated for special protection,and developing a plan for dealing with oil spills.</TEXT></DOC>
