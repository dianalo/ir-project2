Reacting to a published report, Quayle's wife, who also attendedthe Indiana University School of Law, said the special orientationprogram Quayle participated in was unrelated to any affirmativeaction plan.   A law school official said affirmative action for blacks orother minorities ``was not a strong consideration at that time.''   The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported earlier Friday that theadmissions program Quayle went through in 1970 was intended tooffer equal opportunity to minority group members, the economicallydisadvantaged and other ``students of different viewpoints andbackgrounds.''   The newspaper quoted Cleon H. Foust, dean of the law school whenQuayle entered, as saying ``I can only remember blacks'' as the aimof the program.   ``The program sort of made up for their background,'' he said.``The suggestion was that many had not had the scholasticbackground to cut the mustard in graduate school.''   Foust declined comment when contacted by The Associated Press onFriday.   Law school officials and Marilyn Quayle said Friday the programwas designed to help any aspirants whose college grades andentrance exam scores weren't good enough to ensure admission butwho had other credentials that indicated they might succeed in lawschool.   As he left Canton, Ohio, Quayle told reporters, ``I got into lawschool fair and square. No rules were broken.''   Asked if he had enrolled in a special program, he said he hadtaken a summer course. ``It was just a class that was recommendedto me by the dean.''   He refused to speak about the Plain Dealer story, saying, ``I'mgoing to talk about the issues that the American people areinterested in, not some story.''   G. Kent Frandsen, who was in charge of admissions when Quayleapplied in 1970, said ``there were probably less than threeminorities'' among about 30 students admitted into the schoolduring the program's two years.   He said law schools traditionally had little data other thancollege grade-point averages and law school admission tests to useas criteria for admissions. In the late 1960s, the university's lawschool faculty authorized faculty member Charles Kelso to conduct aprogram by which he would review other information.   Among such information, Frandsen recalled, were a student'sundergraduate major, courses taken, the school attended and lettersof recommendation.   ``Affirmative action was not a strong consideration at thattime,'' Frandsen said.   Larrie Wilkins, associate dean for academic affairs at theschool, was quoted by the Plain Dealer as saying, ``The affirmativeaction element is implicit if not explicit'' in documentsdescribing the program, ``but since affirmative action was not theexclusive aim, we would not expect all participants in this programto have been minority candidates.''   Mrs. Quayle said the pre-entrance program wasn't an affirmativeaction program.   ``It was this special admissions program for any student who thedean and professors thought could make it through law school andwould be a good attorney,'' she said while campaigning inIndianapolis.   ``Dan Quayle made it through law school, did a good job, passedthe bar exam on the first time, which a number of people who haverun for president have not done,'' Mrs. Quayle said.   The law school in Indianapolis directed all inquiries Friday tothe university's news bureau, where the staff said law schoolofficials were trying to put together an accurate portrait of thepre-entrance program.   ``The information about it is sketchy,'' said Charlotte Wright,an editor at the news bureau. She said the program ``certainlywasn't called'' an affirmative action program.   Meanwhile in Washington, 12 House Democrats held a newsconference to accuse Quayle of hypocrisy for using the specialprogram and then voting in Congress against education programs suchas teacher training, Head Start and aid for disadvantaged students..   ``It seems to me Dan Quayle owes an explanation about how he gotinto law school ... and took advantage of a program clearlydesigned to help minorities and the disadvantaged,'' said Rep.Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.   The Democrats called on the university to release recordssurrounding Quayle's admission to its law school, and they askedQuayle to release copies of his academic records.   The university has said it will not release Quayle's recorduntil he grants permission.</TEXT></DOC>
