While the liberalization wasn't a major one, it flies inthe face of attempts by Congress to legislate tougherstandards for allowing foreigners to buy promising butfinancially struggling U.S. companies. The House Energy andCommerce Committee is preparing to report on a bill todaythat would make these reviews tougher on prospective foreignbuyers.</LP><TEXT>   The final Treasury rules to be published today in theFederal Register contain only a few departures from thepreliminary version that the Treasury Department issued inJuly 1989. But the intent of these changes is clearly toimprove the investment climate, rather than to limit theacquisition of U.S. technology. &quot;The rules reflect theTreasury's institutional concerns with keeping open the flowof capital to the U.S.,&quot; said Joseph Denin, a lawyerspecializing in such acquisitions.   The Treasury, for instance, responded to a major concernof foreign banks by ruling that they don't have to notify theU.S. government of their loans to U.S. companies if thelending wouldn't give the banks control over theseenterprises. The original rules proposed in 1989 were vagueabout how such transactions would be treated.   The new rules also exempt foreigners from having to obtainU.S. government approval for acquiring technology thatroutinely accompanies the purchase of equipment, such as&quot;instruction manuals and operating procedures.&quot; A number oflawyers representing foreign principals have complained ofthe burdensome nature of this part of the process.   In addition, the rules won't regard a publicly traded U.S.company to be &quot;foreign-controlled&quot; even when foreign partiesown the majority of its stock, as long as no single foreignparty, acting alone or in concert with other foreigners, isin control of that company. This provision could exempt manypublicly traded industrial companies from having to reportvarious types of equity transactions.   Foreign investors petitioned the Treasury to establish a&quot;sunset&quot; period for investigations, after which theadministration would no longer have the right to examine anacquisition. The rules only partially accommodate theinvestors, setting a three-year limit for other federalagencies to seek such an investigation but retaining theWhite House's right to do so.   These rules amplify legislation that authorizes thepresident to review such acquisitions from the standpoint ofnational security. An interagency committee, headed by theTreasury, takes notice of such transactions and, ifnecessary, recommends actions for the president to take.   The Treasury said it had rejected proposed rule changesthat would detract from presidential discretion, includingpublishing the results of these reviews or even defining&quot;national security.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
