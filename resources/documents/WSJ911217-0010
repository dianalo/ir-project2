Shorter-term Treasurynotes were little changed, and rates on six-month Treasurybills fell slightly.   A fresh batch of gloomy economic reports yesterdayheightened speculation that the Fed will move quickly to trimshort-term interest rates once again. The Fed's policy-makingFederal Open Market Committee meets today in Washington.Industrial production sagged 0.4% in November, twice as big adrop as analysts had expected. Also, factories, utilities andmines operated at a seasonally adjusted 79.1% of capacitylast month, down from 79.6% in October.   The Fed committee is widely expected to approve areduction of at least 1/4 percentage point in the federalfunds rate, the rate on overnight loans between banks. Thatwould bring the funds rate down to 4 1/4%. In addition, theFederal Reserve Board is expected to cut the discount rate,the rate it charges on loans to banks and savingsinstitutions, by 1/2 percentage point to 4%.   Traders also said 30-year bond prices were bolstered by aTreasury official's comment that the department may sellfewer new 30-year issues in the future.   The likelihood of lower U.S. rates made the dollar lookless attractive against other major currencies, currencytraders said. The dollar fell yesterday against both theGerman mark and the Japanese yen.   But even another Fed rate cut may not produce the magicelixir that revives the U.S. economy or sparks a bigstock-market rally, some investment managers said. Theybelieve the Fed would be wise to leave rates where they areto help convince investors that inflation will remain undercontrol. This in turn could help drive down long-term bondyields, these managers contend.   &quot;Those who are looking for instant gratification in termsof an economic rebound in response to another Federal Reservecut in rates are doomed to be disappointed,&quot; said MichaelMetz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. &quot;A cutin short rates isn't going to have any real impact on eitherconsumer confidence or on investment spending,&quot; he said.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices crept higher.

The yield on the Treasury's benchmark30-year issue fell to 7.75% from 7.77% Friday.
