Mr. Smoot sits behind a wall-size window here at BellCommunications Research, rummaging through papers. He noticesvisitors and stops to say hello. But his visitors would needawfully long arms to shake his hand, because Mr. Smoot isactually in Morristown, N.J., 55 miles away.</LP><TEXT>   His image is being projected through fiber optics, andit's so lifelike that even skeptical reporters are startledto find he's not simply sitting behind a pane of glass.   This might seem like video magic, but the uses of fiberoptics are neither far off nor far-fetched. Within just a fewyears, fiber optics &quot;is going to change the way we live andthe way we do business. It's going to completely transformour world,&quot; says Stewart Personick, a fiber optics pioneerand an assistant vice president at Bell CommunicationsResearch.   Fiber optics could change television within a few years byallowing more choices for more people and a much wider rangeof video services. Telephone companies are testing links thatlet doctors transmit X-rays and other diagnostic tests todistant specialists for instant evaluations.   Another likely development: artificial-reality machinesthat use remarkably crisp pictures and sound to &quot;deliver&quot; aviewer to a pristine tropical beach, to a big football gameor to a quiet mountaintop retreat. Japanese researchersenvision golfers practicing their swings in front ofthree-dimensional simulations of courses.   The spread of fiber optic networks could have profoundimplications for where and how people live and work. As suchsophisticated communications become more commonplace,business travel could be reduced. The efficiency of fibernetworks also raises the prospect that work forces won't needto be so concentrated: Many employees will be able tocontribute to organizations without having to live in or nearbig cities.   &quot;Doctors could have world offices, not local offices. AndI could go on vacation -- or pick a vacation spot -- byimmersing myself in a different environment, stroll down thestreets of Barcelona or along a Caribbean beach,&quot; says Mr.Smoot, an executive at Bell Communications Research.   The technology is so powerful that last month the CommerceDepartment refused to lift its ban on exporting fiber systemsto the Soviet Union. Citing national security, the agencyrejected a plan by U S West Inc. to build a trans-Sovietfiber network that would link Japan and Europe. At the sametime, however, the U.S. allowed shipment of older and slowerfiber technology to Eastern Europe.   Even in the U.S., significant obstacles must be overcomebefore the promise of fiber optics becomes reality. Phonecompanies are finding it difficult to offer fiberuniversally. Sharks like to chew on undersea fiber cables.Bringing fiber to homes and small businesses is provingespecially tough. And fiber itself isn't a flawlesstechnology. For example, there's the challenge of keepingphone service working when electric power goes out.   Underlying all these issues is a more fundamental questionof economics: whether there will be enough demand for fiberservices to justify speeding up construction of a nationwidefiber-based broad-band network, conservatively estimated tocost $250 billion.   Meantime, telephone companies and cable television firmsare battling over the vast potential market. Because so muchcan be carried on fiber optic lines, phone companies coulduse their lines for cable TV. But phone companies arecurrently barred from the cable business, and cable companiesare working to make sure that doesn't change.   Fiber optics uses hair-thin strands of super-clear glass,instead of copper wire, to carry conversations, images anddata. Whereas copper wire uses electrical impulses, fiberoptics relies on light to deliver the message.   A single fiber strand can transmit 16,000 phoneconversations at once, compared with 24 for the 100-year-oldcopper wire technology.   It can transport symphony-quality sound, high-definitiontelevision signals and fantastic amounts of data. And sincelight travels a lot faster than electricity, the speed isawesome: The entire text of the Encyclopaedia Britannica andthe Bible could travel around the Earth through a fiber cablein less than two seconds.   &quot;All of the voice communications and all of the datacommunications today are but a tiny trickle of what could becarried in the future,&quot; says Mr. Smoot. &quot;We're sort of likethe blind who have never seen.&quot;   Over the past five years, American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo., MCI Communications Corp., United TelecommunicationsInc.'s US Sprint and other long-distance carriers haveinstalled millions of miles of fiber optic cable. Smalltelecommunications firms are building rings of fiber cable inbig cities. Local telephone companies are stringing fiberbetween their major switching offices and conducting tests inneighborhoods.   By most counts, much of the U.S. will be &quot;glassed&quot; by theyear 2015.   The idea of sending messages by light is as ancient assignal fires. John Tyndall, a British physicist who explainedwhy the sky is blue, enlivened his lectures during the 1870sby demonstrating that light can bend. He focused a beamthrough a huge container of water with a spout near thebottom. As the water shot out and bent with the force ofgravity, the audience could see light trapped within thestream.   In the 1880s, Alexander Graham Bell proved that a lightbeam could carry voice signals. And in the 1960s, when thelaser emerged from Bell Labs and scientists in Englandadvocated using ultra-pure glass fibers to transmit phonecalls, fiber optics jumped to the fast track.   Soon after, Corning Inc. developed glass so clear that ifoceans were made of it, the bottom of the Mariana Trench,nearly six miles below the surface of the Pacific, would bevisible. In 1983, MCI placed the first commercial order for90,000 miles of fiber cable.   These days, high-capacity fiber can dispatch 1.8 billionbits of information a second over a single wispy strand ofglass. This is how: A transmitter containing a tiny laserconverts electrical signals that represent human voices,computer data, text or pictures into modulated light waves --flashes of ones and zeros -- for digital transmission. Themost sophisticated lasers, with a light source no bigger thana grain of salt, blink on and off about one billion times asecond.   At the other end, a photo detector picks up the signal andtransforms the flashes back to an electrical signal that canbe reconverted to voice, data or video.   Several signals can be fed into the glass strand at thesame time and yet remain discrete even after traveling manymiles at top speed. Electrical signals, on the other hand,tend to mingle after a short trip through copper wire. Andunlike copper, fiber can carry signals in both directions atthe same time.   One of the earliest benefits to come roaring down thefiber autobahn will be crystal-clear video conferencing.Consider Mr. Smoot's image. It is delivered over a largerear-projection, high-resolution screen set into the wall.Multiple camera angles give a panoramic view, leaving theviewer with the impression of looking through a window.   Most video conferencing over phone lines today doesn'tprovide full-motion pictures, so an executive's wave createsa blur across the screen. The video switches that will bepart of the fiber optic network will let customers receivefull-motion movies and other video works on demand. Theswitches will also let them send crisp, full-motion videopictures. Parents could send videos of their children torelatives across the country -- either tapes from lastThanksgiving or a live birthday party.   Prototypes have been developed, but none is commerciallyavailable. Much needs to be done before that happens.   More than four million miles of fiber optic cable have nowbeen laid across the U.S., much of it alongside railroad andsubway tracks. Even abandoned coal tunnels beneath thestreets of Chicago now provide a home for fiber cable. Tolink continents, thousands of miles of fiber have been reeledfrom huge boats. ATandamp;T has its own fleet.   A month after a cable was installed in the Atlantic offthe Canary Islands five years ago, the connection went dead,or &quot;dark&quot; in the parlance of fiber optics. Hauling the cableup, technicians found shark teeth embedded in the casing. Onebite had shorted the cable. After three more outages,technicians set about creating a Jaws-proof sheath.   The teeth didn't go to waste. They were set in a dentalmold and used to test designs.   The major deterrent to the spread of fiber is cost. Untilrecently, it was far more expensive than copper. But beforelong, fiber will cost less than copper because ofefficiencies and higher production.   Yet even though fiber is already beginning to make senseeconomically for new construction and replacement -- some newhousing developments are being strung with glass instead ofwire -- ripping out copper before the end of its useful lifeand replacing it with fiber is too expensive.   Another problem is keeping the phones working in a powerfailure. The typical telephone receiver operates onelectricity. Because copper conducts electricity well, thepower for today's phone service comes over the phone linesthemselves, and the phones can even be powered by back-upbatteries in case of an outage. That's what happened in theSan Francisco earthquake. But glass fiber isn't an efficientconductor of electricity, so phones might have to be poweredby the local electric company. If there were a local poweroutage, there would be a phone outage, too. Phone companiesare considering alternatives such as backup batteries.   GTE Corp. is conducting the largest and most sophisticatedfiber trial in the U.S. to date. In Cerritos, Calif., thecompany has joined the local cable operator to test a fibernetwork that will connect up to 700 households. About 100will receive telephone and TV signals over the same fiberline. At the same time, the two are testing a coaxial networkfor interactive video and pay-per-view movies.   Customers in some homes and a demonstration center atGTE's Cerritos lab site will be able to send home videos backand forth, as well as order up movies. Unlike in regularpay-TV, viewers will have all the conveniences of using aVCR: They will be able to stop the movie and watch the restof it later, to fast-forward through dull passages, or toreplay favorite scenes.   Across the country, about 50 small cities or developmentsare being &quot;glassed&quot; for various phone-company trials.   But regulatory and social-policy questions remain to besettled.   Phone companies want to reverse the 1984 Cable Actprovision that bars them from owning cable systems withintheir territories. Phone companies say they can offer thebest check on skyrocketing cable fees: real competition.   Meantime, the Bells want Congress to ease some of therestraints of the consent decree that broke up ATandamp;T. Thedecree bars them from many activities, including videoprogramming.   The Bells could transmit movies and other video fare as acommon carrier, but programming is where the big money is.The Bells contend that, without a financial interest inprogramming, they couldn't justify the expense of fiber.   &quot;We need adequate earnings opportunities,&quot; says A. GrayCollins, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s executive vice president ofexternal affairs. &quot;The current form of regulation gives us noreason to introduce new services and technology. We can't beexpected to build the network and not be allowed to benefitfrom it.&quot; Without incentives, Mr. Collins says, manycustomers won't get fiber until 2030 or so -- 20 years laterthan is possible.   But many consumer groups think the phone companies areasking far too much. Gene Kimmelman, legislative director forthe Consumer Federation of America, points out that manyinformation services don't rely on fiber, such as the massesof electronic information that already crisscross the globeon copperwire. And he questions why phone companies should beallowed to accelerate the deployment of fiber when consumersaren't clamoring for the extra features. Mr. Kimmelmanbelieves fancy services that can be delivered only over fiberoptics will eventually evolve, but he thinks the phonecompanies have greatly overestimated demand.   &quot;Why should we pay hundreds of billions of dollars toaccelerate investment when we already have an infrastructurethat can provide all these services?&quot; asks Mr. Kimmelman.&quot;Fiber will come to the home when it is cost-effective.&quot;   The Bells claim there is little time to lose. They saythat strategic competitors such as Japan, Germany and Franceare gaining the advantage by aggressively installing fiberoptic networks.   They worry that big corporations, the most lucrativesegment of the U.S. phone business, will continue to developtheir own networks -- which can be designed, built andinstalled by foreign rivals.   The U.S. companies also argue that foreign telephonecompanies could end up with more sophisticated networks thatcould process transactions faster. That would attractfinancial services businesses and othertelecommunications-intensive industries away from the U.S.,they say.   Whether or not the U.S. gets in the game aggressively, Mr.Smoot notes, fiber optics is on its way. &quot;For the future,what you're looking at is telepresence -- allowing me to bewhere you are. Not just seeing you, but seeing all of thethings associated with you -- all the papers on the desk,your PC, your whole environment,&quot; he says.   &quot;This is a wave that is not possible to stop.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          ALTHOUGH LIGHT and electricity travel at about the samebasic speed, voice and data messages can be transmitted muchfaster through light than through electricity in copperwires. The reason is the much greater bandwidth of light,which permits far greater capacity. In last Tuesday'sedition, the comparison of speeds was oversimplified.   (WSJ July 17, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
