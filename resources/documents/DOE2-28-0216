<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0216 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Bureau of Mines recently initiated a study of geologic features thatcontribute to roof instability in western U.S. underground coal minesto provide information for use in ground-control planning and safety-hazardreduction in that region. Although the conditions found do not differin kind from hazardous geologic conditions in the Eastern United States,they do differ in intensity of occurrence and relative importance. Threedepositional features dominate where unstable roof occurs in westernunderground coal mines: paleochannel deposits, crevasse splay deposits,and flood basin deposits. Three structural features identified as hazardous,but not so widespread or common as the depositional hazards, are faulting,jointing, and igneous intrusions. The survey establishes a foundationfor future studies aimed at reducing and preventing ground control accidentsin western coal mines.</TEXT></DOC>
