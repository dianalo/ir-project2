But they won't be hearing from Chairman Frank Lorenzo; he isn't invited, even if he is a Harvard alumnus.    This unusual meeting has been called by pilots union leaders, who want to pick apart the financial statements of Texas Air. Among those at the podium will be Wright George, a Harvard M.B.A. who flies in the jump seat as a second officer aboard one of Mr. Lorenzo's jets.    &quot;We went to the same business school,&quot; Mr. George, a pilots union official, says of the company's chairman. &quot;But he's on the top and I'm on the bottom.&quot;    During the presentation, the Air Line Pilots Association will begin an uphill campaign to win over Wall Street in the labor-cost battle at Eastern Airlines, an unprofitable unit of Texas Air. Among the union's more startling objectives: to convince analysts that debt holders, not just union members, should be asked to help restore Eastern to profitability.    &quot;We may talk about whether the debt holders should take a haircut,&quot; perhaps through a debt restructuring, Mr. George says -- a notion that could touch off jitters in the junk-bond market, where Texas Air has been one of the busiest borrowers. &quot;We're suggesting we should all sit down and come to a compromise that makes this company viable,&quot; he says.    Texas Air dismisses the union-sponsored meeting of analysts as a comic-strip event. &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids are at it again,&quot; one company official snickers.    Analysts recognize that the pilots have a political agenda, but are eager to learn what they have to say. Some are going as curiosity seekers -- just for a peek at the union leaders who have put up such a pitched battle against the hard-nosed Mr. Lorenzo.    Union leaders will argue that Mr. Lorenzo's business plan is all wrong. &quot;Why is he fighting with labor when he's already got the lowest labor costs in the industry?&quot; Mr. George says. &quot;You don't run a service company in a service industry with upset employees.&quot;    Nobody disputes that Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit has the industry's lowest labor costs. As for Eastern, the union claims its labor costs are much lower than those of other major carriers. But company figures suggest that Eastern's labor costs are roughly average in the industry.    The union leaders also will attack one of Wall Street's most dearly held beliefs about Texas Air -- something that has long helped to sustain its stock price: that for all its losses and labor travails, the company still sits on a motherlode of cash. The company's cash on June 30 totaled $703 million, down only 10% from the beginning of the year, though a far cry from the billion-dollar balance that it carried in 1986.    The current cash position is too thin, the union claims. According to an analysis by Farrell Kupersmith, an accountant at Touche Ross andamp; Co. who is working with the pilots and who will join in tomorrow's presentation, well more than $100 million of the consolidated cash is invested in securities issued from within Texas Air itself. In addition, Eastern continues to burn at least $20 million in cash a month as a result of operating losses, he reckons. And with more than $5 billion in consolidated Texas Air debt, there is always a big payment coming due, he points out.    What happens, Mr. George wonders, if fuel prices or interest rates go through the roof? Texas Air needs a few hundred million in cash just to stay liquid on a day-to-day basis.    For the most part, analysts remain unconvinced that Texas Air is short of cash. For one, fuel prices are falling. For another, Wall Street sources say, Drexel Burnham Lambert just completed a private placement of $100 million in Texas Air notes; the company won't confirm this. Eastern has about three dozen planes it could quickly unload for cash -- perhaps for as much as $350 million, some estimate -- after the company cut flight operations earlier this month by 12%. Continental still has plenty of aircraft it could sell and lease back. Company officials are convinced that Texas Air has ample cash.    &quot;We're reading the same documents, but the unions interpret them a little differently than a financial analyst,&quot; says Timothy Pettee of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;At this point, I don't feel there's a liquidity problem.&quot;    Other analysts insist that Mr. Lorenzo will always remain liquid -- as long as he maintains the confidence on Wall Street that the pilots now are trying to shake. &quot;As long as the financial markets will buy his paper,&quot; says another analyst who is planning to attend tomorrow's meeting, &quot;there is no liquidity crisis.&quot;    ---   Texas Air   (AMEX; Symbol: TEX)   Business: Airline   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Revenue: $8.47 billion   Net loss: $466.1 million   Second quarter, June 30, 1988:   Loss: $255.9 million vs. 27 million*   Average daily trading volume:   413,943 shares   Common shares outstanding:   41.2 million   *1988 figure includes $131 million charge related to accounting adjustment. </TEXT></DOC>
