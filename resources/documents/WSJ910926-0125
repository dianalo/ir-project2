A recenteditorial on the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (&quot;RICO's Stinkin' Badges,&quot; July 5) referredto the statute as &quot;perverted&quot; and &quot;as too dangerous aweapon.&quot;   It is hard to imagine that the Journal's editorial assaultwas occasioned by RICO's frequent use to cripple, if notdestroy, organized criminal groups engaged in the lucrativeinternational narcotics trade. Through RICO, members of thesegroups have been convicted under its terms and sentenced bothto long prison terms and large criminal forfeitures. Moreprobably, the Journal's distress is with the statute's use inso-called white-collar prosecutions.</LP><TEXT>   True, the statute is broad and powerful. Some of its pastuses are fair game for criticism. But the Journal errs mostgrievously when it escalates that criticism to an all-outassault on RICO.   Let me illustrate the value of RICO, not by cataloging itscriminal successes, but by describing another equallyimportant but less well-known use of the statute outside thestrictly criminal context. Over the past five years, the U.S.Attorney's Office that I head has used the civil provisionsof RICO to remove organized crime's influence from entitiesas diverse as a restaurant in Little Italy, the Fulton FishMarket, and the Cement and Concrete Workers Union in NewYork. Such uses invoke the court's broad equitable power tofashion a remedy that will cleanse an organization ofcorruption while preserving its ability to function as alegitimate enterprise.   The paradigm of such uses of RICO involves the nation'slargest trade union, the International Brotherhood ofTeamsters, whose membership exceeds the registered votingpopulation of 26 states. In 1988, after several years ofinvestigation and preparation, a civil RICO case was filedagainst the Teamsters, the members of its executive board,and 27 members and associates of organized crime. The thrustof the case was that the Cosa Nostra, with the aid andconnivance of a corrupt union leadership, had controlled andoperated the union as a lucrative racketeering enterprise fordecades -- using, for example, the Teamsters' richest pensionfund as a mob bank to finance hidden investments in Las Vegascasinos.   Less than a year later, the union agreed to a consentdecree that fundamentally reformed the union's disciplinaryand electoral processes. The consent decree permanentlyamended the Teamsters' constitution to provide for athree-stage electoral process culminating in directrank-and-file election of the union's executive board, aswell as enhanced disciplinary procedures first to beimplemented by court officers and later to be overseen by anindependent review board. The consent decree also providedfor the appointment of three court officers -- an independentadministrator, an investigations officer and an electionofficer -- to carry out the decree's terms until 1992. Thethree officers report to U.S. District Judge David N.Edelstein in Manhattan, who supervises implementation of thedecree.   In the two years since the entry of the consent decree,more than 60 corrupt Teamsters officials have been removedfrom office or otherwise disciplined in streamlinedarbitration-style hearings before the independentadministrator. Several high-level Teamsters officials havebeen permanently barred from the union based on proof thatthey have associated with organized-crime figures.   Dramatic, meaningful reform has changed the character ofthe Teamsters down to the grass-roots level and ensuredself-determination for the union membership. This past Junethe Teamsters held a historic convention at which more than1,900 delegates elected by the membership under the authorityof the consent decree nominated candidates for internationalunion office; those candidates are now campaigning forelection by the rank and file in a supervised vote thisDecember. For the first time in history the internationalofficers will be selected by the rank and file in ademocratic electoral competition among candidates. Three fullslates of candidates for international union office (plussome independent candidates) were nominated at the conventionwithout incident.   Most significant, however, was the open and free characterof the convention. Factions of delegates who in previousyears had been shouted down when they tried to speak on unionaffairs expressed themselves freely and fully. Despite itsrejection of the idea at earlier conventions as anunnecessary measure, a constitutional provision forrank-and-file election of international union officers wasoverwhelmingly adopted. One member who had received only 24delegate votes when he ran for international union office atthe 1986 convention under the previous system where voteswere cast in public, received more than 300delegate-nominating votes in the secret ballot procedure thatprotects members from reprisal. A spontaneous constitutionalamendment requiring secret ballot elections for all Teamstersjoint council officers was brought up and passed from theconvention floor. The delegate who proposed the amendmentnoted that &quot;our rank-and-file members are demanding secrecyin all forms of balloting.&quot;   Grass-roots democracy had been virtually unheard of in theTeamsters, but now the RICO winds of change are blowingstrongly through the union. Press coverage of the Teamstersconvention reflected the union's new character. The Journalitself reported that candidates &quot;at rallies and newsconferences criticized their once-secretive, autocratic unionand its leaders.&quot; The New York Times described the Teamstersas &quot;hurtling toward democracy.&quot; Time magazine concluded that&quot;America's most notorious union is well on the road todemocracy.&quot; Business Week wrote that through the work of thecourt-appointed officers, the Teamsters union, &quot;longconsidered rotten at the top, is on the verge of beingcleaned up.&quot;   All this is due to much-maligned RICO. It was usedsurgically to achieve a law-enforcement objective soughtafter for more than 30 years -- breaking the Mafia's grip onthe Teamsters -- by means that will leave the union strongerand more responsive to its members than ever before.   Can this statute be so bad?   ---   Mr. Obermaier is U.S. Attorney for the Southern Districtof New York.</TEXT></DOC>
