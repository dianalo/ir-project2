Albert Gore ended his bid for the presidency.    The Tennessee Democrat said he will remain a nominal candidate, so that the delegates pledged to him could attend his party's nominating convention in July. Mr. Gore said he didn't plan to endorse either of the two remaining active Democratic candidates, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, before the convention. &quot;I want no part of a stop-Jackson or a stop-Dukakis movement,&quot; he said. &quot;The only man I want to stop is George Bush.&quot;    Sen. Gore, who is 40 years old, wouldn't rule out another run for the presidency, but said, &quot;I genuinely and sincerely have no interest in the vice presidential nomination.&quot;    After bypassing early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Gore last month won caucuses in Wyoming and Nevada and primaries in five border states but failed to win any subsequent events. His campaign ran up a debt of about $1.5 million, and Mr. Gore's third-place finish in New York this week fell well short of the 20% of popular vote needed to remain eligible for federal matching funds. </TEXT></DOC>
