Apple Computer? Sun Microsystems? Or maybe Microsoft?   Wrong. It's Data General, the aging maker of minicomputersfor corporate and industrial use. This stock was almost givenup for dead by traders who watched its relentless slide fromnorth of 38 in 1987 to 4 1/2 as this year began. But DataGeneral shares have since quadrupled. Now analysts whopractically ignored the stock are looking at it again and, insome cases, boosting their earnings forecasts.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, the Westborough, Mass., computer makercontinued its startling comeback, reporting its secondconsecutive profitable quarter on a narrow 1.8% revenueincrease from a year earlier. The stock jumped 1 1/2 to 18 onthe New York Stock Exchange composite tape. Trading volumeexceeded 1.6 million shares, more than four times the averagedaily pace of recent weeks.   Even after yesterday's jump the stock is hardly highpriced. It trades at less than 10 times some analysts' newlyincreased estimates of profit for the fiscal year endingSept. 30.   The company reported fiscal second-quarter profit of $19.2million, or 60 cents a share, compared with a year-earlierloss of $8.6 million, or 29 cents a share. Revenue rose to$320.4 million from $314.8 million. The quarterly profit wasthe largest in two years, and only slightly below recordlevels set in 1984.   Data General's results reflect tight cost controls andgrowing sales at its two-year old Aviion line ofindustry-standard computers. Meanwhile, it has managed tostabilize the decline in its more profitable, proprietaryline, boosting profit margins.   Ronald Skates, president and chief executive officer, whogets credit for much of the improvement in Data General'sperformance, said, &quot;I'm not going to go out and declarevictory.&quot; However, he said, &quot;I believe our strategy is theright strategy. We have our company in fighting form.&quot;   Analysts also cautioned that problems may emerge in futurequarters. However, they quickly raised their estimates forthe year.   Barry Bosak, a Smith Barney analyst, raised his forecastfor the year ending Sept. 30 to $1.90 a share from $1.20.&quot;The story is that Data General knows what's happening in itsMV {proprietary} line and has been able to guide itsdestiny,&quot; he says. In contrast, another old minicomputercompany, Wang Laboratories of Lowell, Mass., reported a bigloss Wednesday on a 15.8% sales decline.   Mr. Bosak says that despite the big runup, &quot;it's aninexpensive stock still. Based on earnings, the stock isworth more.&quot; While Data General trades at a single-digitmultiple of current-year earnings, the broader marketmultiple is around 17.8 times the past 12 months' profit.   Data General prospered in the 1970s and early 1980s byselling its MV line of minicomputers, the designing of whichwas described in the Pulitzer prize winning book, &quot;The Soulof a New Machine.&quot; The computers are used to run factoriesand refineries, office automation systems and smallbusinesses.   But it missed the personal computer revolution. Thenaround 1985, customers started choosing cheaper Unixcomputers or machines made by larger, financially solidcompanies, and Data General started a chain of five straightyears of losses.   Most analysts have avoided following the stock in recentyears, and those few who do have been cautious. John Adams,an analyst with regional brokerage firm, Adams, Harkness andamp;Hill in Boston, says &quot;on the conference call with DataGeneral {after the earnings announcement} the analysts allsounded as if they'd swallowed bars of soap. Nobody enjoysprosperity if they haven't been predicting it.&quot;   Under Mr. Skates, a onetime Price Waterhouse accountantwho joined Data General in 1986, Data General has slashedemployment, focused research and development and controlledoverhead. Much of the year-to-year improvement in the secondquarter reflects a 26% cut in Randamp;D spending to $26.1 millionand a 10% cut in selling, general and administrativespending.   Mr. Skates says that the lower research spending won'taffect its ability to continue to improve both the MV lineand the Aviion line. The cuts reflect secondary interestssuch as telecommunications and object-oriented technology;&quot;We can't be Bell Labs,&quot; he said.   The cuts and stabilization of revenue have &quot;proved theycan generate profits,&quot; says Barry Willman, an analyst withSanford C. Bernstein. But he warned that &quot;it's difficult forcompanies to string together multiple quarters of profits inthis kind of turnaround.&quot; Moreover, Data General's earningsare helped by a very low tax rate as a result of its historyof losses.   Several negative factors will hurt Data General in thecurrent quarter. Mr. Skates said revenue may drop because itwill complete the $46 million sale of its Nippon Data Generalsubsidiary, eliminating $80 million a year in revenue. Thecompany said the sale won't affect profits from operations,but it will book a $13 million gain on the sale, which alsowill increase cash by $35 million. In the future, DataGeneral expects to boost Japanese sales to Omron Corp., thebuyer of its Nippon unit.   Moreover, the MV line may start to falter sinceestablished customers presumably have bought the machinesthey need, says Mr. Willman. He predicts that Aviion saleswill grow only modestly from an estimated $46 million in thepast quarter, although he sees sharper growth in the fourthquarter.   Data General's future depends on sales of its Aviion lineof Unix computers. Last month it introduced a new modeldesigned as a server that sits at the heart of a network ofterminals and personal computers. It runs at 117 millioninstructions per second, or MIPS, and has a base price ofjust $98,000, making it the cheapest such computer of itsspeed. &quot;That Aviion runs like a scalded dog,&quot; says onecustomer, Forrest May, president of Admark Systems Inc., aMemphis firm that sells software and Data General computersystems to advertising agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
