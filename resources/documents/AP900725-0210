Members declined to discuss Iraq's threats in advance of ameeting of the cartel's eight-member monitoring committee latertoday.   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesformally begins its mid-year conference Thursday.   Kuwait's new oil minister, Rasheed Salem al-Ameeri, declined tocomment on reports that Iraq has massed tens of thousands of troopson its border with Kuwait, or on earlier Iraqi threats.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh expressed confidencethe cartel would agree to increase its target price, now at $18 abarrel, to $20 or more.   ``I am in favor of any price that is higher than what we havenow,'' Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said uponarrival this morning.   Asked about the effect of the Persian Gulf tensions on themeeting, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said Tuesday, ``We are aneconomics organization. We talk about economics.''   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said, ``We are here tosolve oil problems.''   Even Iraq's oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, confinedhis public remarks to oil prices. He pushed his proposal to liftthe cartel's target price to $25 a barrel by cutting OPECproduction.   He refused to discuss the reports of Iraqi troop movements.   The troop movements coincide with threats last week by PresidentSaddam Hussein of Iraq to take military action against countriesproducing oil in excess of their OPEC-set caps.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have stubbornly refused inthe past to limit crude output to their quotas. A sharp fall in oilprices in the spring was largely blamed on too much oil on theworld market.   Saddam claimed Iraq, badly in need of money to repair damagefrom its 8-year war with Iran, has lost $14 billion in oil revenuesduring the last year because of falling prices.   Iraqi officials also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billionworth of oil from wells in the border area that they claim are inIraqi territory.   Word of the Iraqi troops sent oil prices higher Tuesday. TheSeptember contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark gradeof U.S. crude, rose 6 cents to settle at $20.56 a 42-gallon barrelon the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Chalabi, the Iraqi minister, called for agreement on a highertarget price.   Libyan Oil Minister Fawzi Shakshuki also said he would likeprices to go up to $25 a barrel. But he said the cartel ``wouldhave been there now'' had prices remained at the strong levelsposted in January.   The average price for seven crudes monitored by the cartelreached $20.46 in early January but plunged to $13.64 a barrel lessthan six months later.   It has since rebounded to $16.25 a barrel.   OPEC accounts for major portion of world oil output and a cartelprice rise would affect the price at the pump in the United States,which imports about half the oil it consumes.   Two OPEC price shocks in the 1970s sent the U.S. economyreeling. But recent OPEC accords _ and prices _ have beenundermined by members' departures from their assigned quotas.   A confidential report, prepared by OPEC's secretariat in Vienna,was understood to say the value of the cartel's target price hasbeen sharply eroded by inflation and exchange rate fluctuations.   According to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity themarket report estimated the cartel's target price slipped fromabout $16 a barrel in January to about $11 last month.   To try to pump up prices, the ministers were expected to agreeto a proposal worked out by Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulfproducers to trim output so total production is limited to about22.5 million barrels a day in the coming months.   Nazer said he was confident that OPEC would strike such a deal.   The OPEC market report, according to the sources, estimated thegroup's output at 23.5 million barrels a day in the April-Junequarter of the year.   Demand for the cartel's oil was estimated to run at 21.8 millionbarrels a day in the July-September quarter, climbing to 24.4million barrels in the final three months of last year year, saidthe sources.   Under the Persian Gulf proposal, Kuwait and the U.A.E. wouldpledge to hold output to 1.5 million barrels a day each. They haveeach been pumping as much as 2 million barrels a day.   Kuwait's quota now stands at 1.5 million barrels a day and theU.A.E.'s at 1.1 million barrels.   Under the proposed arrangement, only U.A.E. would see its supplytarget increase; the other producers would remain at current levels.   OPEC's members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. andVenezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
