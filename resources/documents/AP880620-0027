Henri Namphy broke out ofhouse arrest Sunday night and his troops seized the presidentialpalace and unseated civilian President Leslie Manigat, who hadousted him as military chief.   An Uzi submachine gun in his right hand, a helmeted Namphydeclared on state-run television early Monday that the army was incontrol.   ``The army will lead the country this way,'' the fatigue-cladNamphy shouted, raising his weapon in the speech from thepresidential palace, which was taken in a gun and grenade battle.   He made no mention of Manigat, who had fired him on Fridayduring a power struggle that split Haiti's military leadership.   Government sources said Manigat was taken by ambulance from hisresidence five miles north of the palace to a military hospital.There was no word on his condition, but a journalistic source closeto the military said Manigat would be expelled from the countryearly Monday. He did not name a destination.   The military ran the January balloting, widely criticized asrigged, that saw Manigat elected.   Namphy, surrounded by helmeted soldiers, refused to discuss thebattle between his troops and those loyal to Manigat.   In the seven-minute speech that ended about 1:30 a.m. EDT, hesaid: ``We will not speak of what happened. We are looking ahead.We love the army, the regular army, the army loves the people andthe country.''   He spoke in Creole.   Namphy, 55, looked fatigued and said he was ailing. When hefinished, an army band broke into the national anthem.   A Western diplomat said soldiers of the presidential guard loyalto Namphy had battled troops loyal to Manigat, who was seized athis residence. There was no word on casualties.   Earlier Sunday, Manigat retired the Port-au-Prince police chiefand transferred about two dozen officers, including the head of thepresidential guard.   At about 8:30 p.m. EDT, power went out for about 10 minutes, andgunfire broke out around the presidential palace. Heard from ahotel two blocks away, it died down then surged again shortly aftermidnight, when explosions were also heard, and ended about 1{ hourslater.   The streets of this Caribbean capital of 1 million were deserted.   ``The presidential guard went to get Namphy and brought him tothe palace,'' said the Western diplomat, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The diplomat said the presidential guard had battled troops ofthe 700-man Dessalines Battalion, which is commanded by an Lt. Col.Jean-Claude Paul, whom Namphy tried to reassign last week to anadministrative job.   The journalistic source close to the military said Paul was withhis troops inside Dessalines Barracks, which is adjacent thepresidential palace, surrounded forces loyal to Namphy and refusedto surrender.   Earlier Sunday, Namphy was under house arrest at his walled-inresidence compound in Bon Repos, 15 miles north of the capital.   Manigat retired Namphy as commander in chief of Haiti's7,000-man army on Friday, charging him with insubordination inordering the transfer of lower-ranking officers three days earlier.   The transfer and retirement orders launched a power strugglethat aligned Manigat with Paul.   Namphy was president of the three-man junta that ruled Haiti fortwo years after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile inFrance in February 1986. The junta was disbanded after Manigat'sgovernment was installed.   Manigat was elected on Jan. 17.   An independently run election Nov. 29 was thwarted by widespreadviolence that left more than 30 people dead and the army made noeffort to stop.   Paul's soldiers were blamed for much of the violence. And he wasindicted in March by a U.S. grand jury in Miami and charged withdrug trafficking.   Manigat said last week the objectives of his government were``democratization, modernization and putting the armed forces atthe service of the country.'' Skeptics said it was unclear if thatwould be possible.   The government announced Sunday that Col. Gregoire Figaro, thepolice chief of Port-au-Prince, would be retired and Col. ProsperAvril, head of the presidential guard, would be reassigned to anadministrative post.   Figaro took over as police chief from Col. Albert Pierre, whoNamphy allowed to flee to exile in Brazil despite publicaccusations he killed and tortured pisoners. Figaro also wasunpopular.   Avril, now chief of military attaches, was an adviser to themilitary-led junta until anti-government demonstrations forced himto resign that post in early 1986.   The government announced the changes in a three-page communiquebroadcast on state-run television. The communique said the moveswere authorized by Namphy's replacement, Brig. Gen. Morton Gousse,but gave no further explanation.   These were among the other transfers ordered Sunday:   _Capt. Isidore Pognon, commander of Fort Dimanche, a militarygarrison where thousands of political opponents were sent duringthe 29-year dictatorship begun by Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier in1957 and continued by his son, was transferred to militaryheadquarters.   _Maj. Henry Robert Augustin, Namphy's former aide, was put incharge of the army's dry cleaning and laundry services.   _Capt. Ernest Ravix, military commander of the north coastaltown of St. Marc through which much illegal contraband passes, wastransferred to the remote southwestern province of Grand' Anse.</TEXT></DOC>
