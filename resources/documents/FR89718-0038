White, Chief, RegulationsStaff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration,(202) 233-3005. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On May 2, 1989, the U.S. District Courtfor the Northern District of California issued an order in the case ofNehmer, et al., v. United States Veterans' Administration, et al., interpretingthe rulemaking requirements of the Dioxin and Radiation Exposure CompensationStandards Act, Pub. L. No. 98-542. The court found Congress intended thatVA predicate service connection upon a finding of significant statisticalassociation between exposure and disease. The court also found that VAwas required to apply its benefit-of-the-doubt policy to the aggregaterulemaking determination as to which diseases were associated with dioxinexposure. To implement this court decision we propose to amend 38 CFR 1.17 concerningstudy evaluation criteria. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of that section havealways applied to the evaluation of individual scientific or medical studiesand are being retained in their entirety with the exception of technicalamendments to paragraph (a) changing ``Administrator'' to ``Secretary''in accordance with VA's elevation to Cabinet status and including clarifyinglanguage to more closely track the statutory charge to evaluate studiesinvolving exposure to herbicides containing dioxin rather than exposureto dioxin alone. New paragraphs are being added to establish that serviceconnection will be predicated upon determinations of significant statisticalassociation between dioxin or radiation exposure and various diseases asshown by scientific and medical studies. Paragraph (c) provides that the guidelines for establishing service connectionbased on dioxin or radiation exposure (38 CFR 3.311a and 3.311b) will beamended whenever the Secretary determines that a significant statisticalassociation exists between such exposure and any disease. These determinationswill be based on the evaluation of scientific and medical studies and onthe advice of the Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards.Paragraph (d)(1) sets forth the general proposition that a significantstatistical association shall be deemed to exist when the relative weightsof valid positive and negative studies permit the Secretary to concludethat it is at least as likely as not that the purported relationship betweenexposure and disease exists. This conclusion will be based on a balancingtest considering the relative strengths and weaknesses of valid studieswhose findings relate to the existence of the relationship under consideration.This balancing test incorporates VA's ``reasonable doubt'' doctrine withrespect to this evaluation process. The criteria for determining whethera study is valid and whether it is positive or negative with respect tothe issue under consideration are set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) through(d)(4). There are three criteria which must be satisfied in order for a study tobe considered valid for purposes of determining whether a significant statisticalassociation exists. First, the study design and the methods of data collection,verification and analysis must be adequately described. Such descriptionsare necessary for reviewers to properly assess study results. Second, the study must be reasonably free of biases which would cause seriousdoubt to be cast on the study's findings and conclusions. While all biaseswhich can affect a study's results are not listed, selection, observationand participation of subjects are included as examples of some of the biasesinvestigators must clearly avoid. The third criterion for a valid study is a satisfactory accounting forknown confounding factors which, if not identified and corrected for, couldskew the study results. For example, a study involving lung cancer anddioxin or radiation exposure would have to satisfactorily account for theeffects of cigarette smoking or asbestos exposure in the study populationsand correct for those factors.In addition to satisfying the criteria for a valid study, findings of avalid <T3>positive</T3> study must also be statistically significant at a probabilitylevel of .05 or less and must properly account for multiple comparisonand subgroup analyses. Statistical significance at a probability levelof .05 or less means that it must be statistically demonstrated that thelikelihood is only one in twenty, or less, that the results of the studyare due to chance alone. This is to be accomplished using a standard epidemiologicaltool for determining with a high degree of confidence that the observedassociation is real and not a chance occurence. Additionaly, it is recognizedthat multiple comparisons within a study population or division of a studypopulation into numerous subgroups can, upon analysis of the data, produceresults which may be meaningful or may be due to chance. It is throughproper analysis of the multiple comparisons and subgroup divisions by theinvestigators that the possibility of attributing undue importance to chancefindings may be avoided.In order to be considered a valid <T3>negative</T3> study, the criteria for a valid study would have to besatisfied, and, in addition, the study would have to have sufficient statisticalpower to detect the association of interest if it existed. This means thatthe study would have to include a sufficient number of subjects in boththe exposed group and the comparison group to provide an opportunity forthe purported association to appear if, in fact, it were there to be detected.While satisfaction of the criteria in paragraph (d) will require a determinationof ``significant statistical association'', paragraph (e) is being addedto give the Secretary latitude to find that such an association existson the basis of other scientific or medical evidence which may not satisfythe requirements of paragraph (d) in all respects. The Secretary must havethe freedom to act positively on behalf of the veteran population in thoseinstances where the results of one or more studies are so compelling thatit is unnecessary to insist on complete satisfaction of the criteria inparagraph (d) before making a finding of significant statistical association.This change establishes specific criteria which would require further amendmentof adjudication regulations, however nothing in this regulatory proposalshould be construed as in any way limiting or diminishing the Secretary'srulemaking authority under 38 U.S.C. 210(c).The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612.The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directlyaffect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected.Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from theinitial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections603 and 604.In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretaryhas determined that this regulatory amendment is non-major for the followingreasons.(1) It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore.(2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices.(3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104,64.105, 64.109, and 64.110.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 1 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, claims. <ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: July 12, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
