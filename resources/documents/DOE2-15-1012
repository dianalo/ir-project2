<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-1012 </DOCNO><TEXT>High-level radioactive waste (HLW) is currently stored at the SavannahRiver Plant in underground carbon steel tanks. The HLW, which is comprisedof water soluble (salt solution) and water insoluble (sludge) species,will be processed. This process will concentrate the highly radioactivespecies as a solid phase for vitrification into a borosilicate glassin the Defense Waste Processing Facility which will eventually be placedin the federal HLW repository. The remaining water soluble species willcomprise a low-level liquid waste (LLW). This LLW or decontaminated saltsolution will be incorporated into a cement waste form, saltstone, andplaced in a lined vault on-site. Off-gas condensate from the melter isa relatively dilute nitrate salt solution which will be recycled to theinterim waste storage facilities. This solution is extremely corrosiveto carbon steel. Several technologies were considered to decrease levelsof hazardous and corrosive species in these solutions and to reduce involume of liquid waste requiring disposal in saltstone. Electrolyticreduction appeared particularly attractive because of the high nitrateconversion and the potential for significant volume reduction by recycleof the sodium hydroxide. Additional radionuclide decontamination andreduced solution corrosivity may also be realized. Electrochemical separationwas investigated because of the potential for recycling both nitric acidand sodium hydroxide at lower electrical energy costs than for the electrolyticreduction process.</TEXT></DOC>
