MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oil futures prices hit a three-year high astraders reacted to news that could spell trouble for the energyindustry, including a North Sea gas explosion and an industryreport that showed U.S. crude production fell to its lowest levelsince the 1960s.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May price of West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, jumped $1.10 to$22.61 a barrel Wednesday, the highest level since Jan. 17, 1986,when the near-term contract finished at $23.53 a barrel.   Prices continued higher in early trading today, with thecontract for May delivery up 29 cents to $22.90 a barrel.   The explosion on a small gas platform Tuesday forced theshutdown of a major oil pipeline carrying 472,000 barrels a day ofBrent crude mostly to European cities. Officials of Shell U.K.Exploration and Production did not say when normal operations wouldresume. The platform is a main gathering point for Brent crudecoming from major oil fields in the North Sea.   Meanwhile, a leak in a pumping station 25 miles southeast ofFairbanks, Alaska, forced a reduction in oil flow through theAlaska pipeline. Oil was cut by 25 percent to 1.5 million barrels,but was expected to return to full operation shortly, officialssaid.   Energy brokers said the timing of the events, following theAlaskan oil spill last month and other recent production problemsin the North Sea and elsewhere, exacerbated the impact on oilprices.   ``The reason we're seeing oil prices going up is because ofthese accidents,'' said C. Hossein Tahmassebi, chief economist forAshland Oil Inc. ``Without them, the market situation would beconsiderably different.''   In the last six months oil prices have risen more than $10 abarrel, or nearly 80 percent. Last Oct. 5, crude prices dipped to$12.60 a barrel.   Among refined products traded on the exchange Wednesday, the Maycontract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.76 cent to 74.62 cents agallon, while heating oil for May delivery increased 0.57 cent to53.33 cents a gallon.   The American Petroleum Institute, meanwhile, released itsmonthly report showing that domestic production in March totaled7.65 million barrels a day, down 8.2 percent, or 690,000 barrelsper day, from the year-ago level.   U.S. production had not been that low since 1964, when itaveraged 7.614 million barrels a day, said Ron Planting, an APIsenior analyst in Washington.   The API, which represents major oil producers and refiners,attributed the drop to the March 24 Alaskan oil spill and todeclining production in other major U.S. oilfields. The spill lastmonth temporarily shut down critical oil shipping lanes into thelower United States.   ``Although the unusually large decline reflected in partdevelopments related to the tanker grounding near Valdez, almost300,000 barrels per day of the 690,000 barrel-a-day decrease wasaccounted for by falling production in the lower 48, a decline thathas continued now for three years,'' the API report said.   Planting noted that while problems in Alaska oil fields aretemporary, ``what's happening in the lower 48 is not.''   Analysts said that despite the recent rise in crude prices, itwill take time for the United States to increase production. Andthe Alaskan spill will delay congressional permission for major oilcompanies to begin drilling in the protected Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge, which is believed to hold huge reserves of oil andnatural gas.   Tahmassebi said many in and out of the industry are questioningthe reason for the North Sea accidents.   ``Is this happening because of low oil prices and companiescutting back on maintenance to keep up profitability?'' he said.``If so, these types of things will continue happening.''   Analysts said the market also got a boost from a weekly APIreport released after the close of trading Tuesday that showedcrude oil stocks fell by 5.7 million barrels last week.   Jim Steel, an energy analyst with Refco Inc., said the reportreflected growing seasonal demand for oil and oil products as thespring-summer driving season gets under way. He said that over thenext few weeks, gasoline prices could continue to drive crudefutures higher.   ``Gasoline has been so strong out of proportion to crude thatplayers can buy crude and turn it into gasoline at a good profit,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
