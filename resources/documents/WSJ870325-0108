IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST AFRICPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a significant show of solidarity that could nudge oil prices higher in coming weeks, Saudi Arabia and Algeria reached an &quot;understanding&quot; to harden further the terms of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' December Geneva agreement aimed at restricting oil production.    The two countries, which have been longtime rivals and sometimes outright enemies in OPEC, achieved their rapprochement two weeks ago when King Fahd visited Algerian President Chadli Benjedid, according to both OPEC officials and a trade publication close to Algerian sources.    The two nations' accord calls for further production restraint. According to both Petrostrategies, a Paris-based trade newsletter, and to independent OPEC sources, Algeria and Saudi Arabia agreed to urge other producers of the group to sacrifice any oil production &quot;lost&quot; as a result of oil-company resistance to OPEC's official $18-a-barrel price, thus starving the oil markets in coming weeks and months.    OPEC production has fallen below 14 million barrels a day, compared with an authorized ceiling of 15.8 million barrels a day. Saudi output has fallen steeply as has that of Qatar, Iran, Nigeria and Libya. The Saudi-Algerian accord stipulates that these producers don't attempt to make up the loss in future months when demand for their oil inevitably revives.    In addition, said Petrostrategies, both Saudi Arabia and Algeria agreed to keep pressure on their allies to &quot;apply the Geneva agreement in its entirety to the letter for prices to restabilize on the oil market.&quot; Lastly, sources said, both countries reaffirmed the already widespread intention in OPEC to avoid any meetings before the regularly scheduled meeting of the group in June. OPEC aims, thereby, to prevent speculation on policy changes that tends to weaken world oil prices.    The solidifying of OPEC's political front implied in these understandings goes far beyond the immediate impact of the resolutions, specialists say. The old divisions between various groupings in OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on one hand and Algeria and Iran on the other, apparently are dissolving, enhancing the group's influence in world oil markets.    &quot;The signs are that all the OPEC countries are determined to proceed in this direction,&quot; noted Ali Khalifa Al Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, in a recent interview in the Kuwaiti daily Al-Anbaa. &quot;The OPEC countries now realize that (their marketing) difficulties are temporary and will come to an end.&quot;    Specialists say that the test of strength between OPEC and oil companies refusing to buy its oil at the higher prices is tilting in favor of the cartel. &quot;In my opinion the companies can't continue to use their storage of oil much longer instead of buying OPEC oil,&quot; says a former Algerian oil official, Nordine Ait-Laoussine, who is managing director of Nalcosa, a Geneva-based oil consulting company. He estimated that &quot;in a month or two&quot; companies will be rushing back to buy oil from OPEC provided, he said, that &quot;no one cracks or gives discounts.&quot;    So far, analysts and industry sources say, there hasn't been any evidence of OPEC discounts from the $18-a-barrel price.    Saudi Arabia, which acts as the guardian angel of the accord to hold output down, has allowed its own production to fall as low as 2.5 million barrels a day.    In a recent statement on the subject, Hisham Nazer, the country's oil minister said, &quot;While we can't say it will continue at this level until the end of March, it does show that Saudi Arabia is adhering to the December agreement.&quot; He added that his country &quot;will continue to adhere to the agreement&quot; so long as the other OPEC countries do. </TEXT></DOC>
