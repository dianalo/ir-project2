 In the broadest terms, the big change is thatinput and output devices of color systems are now fully digital.andP;  At thestart of the decade, all of the drum scanners were analog devices, litteredwith knobs that controlled them.andP;  Today's scanners still must convert analoginput into digital data for the computer, but the dials may be software,rather than physical knobs.andP;  Now, virtually all color scanners, from desktopto large-format drum units, are digitally driven.andM;The division of the scanning and recording process into two distinct stepsserved by distinct products is a direct result of the infusion of computersinto the separation process.andP;  With the computer becoming the heart of thesystem, most new scanners today merely scan the image; the screening anddot-generating computer and software that form the heart of a traditionalcolor scanner are left out of many of today's input devices, which makes themmuch less expensive.andP;  The use of charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays has madepossible scanners far less expensive than laser-based units.andM;The same shift has happened on the output side.andP;  A decade ago, film recordersused contact screens to make halftones.andP;  Today, halftones are created in thecomputer, which makes retouching and dot etching a software application,rather than a craft in which someone labors over film with a bottle ofcyanide solution.andM;Laser-based digital imagesetters are now being used as substitutes for drumrecorders, and new, sophisticated digital color film recorders are opening upnew possibilities in output formats and substrates.andP;  Digital color proofingdevices, inheard of in 1980, are readily available today for coarse colorproofing, and ones of higher quality are beginning to appear.andM;ScannersandM;Like their counterparts in the computer and printer worlds, scanner vendorshave created a widely segmented market.andP;  These days, most of the action inscanners is at the low end: the 300- and 400-dpi scanners for 35mm andreflective copy.andP;  There was a new one of these at Graph Expo--the Intergraph1170--but Graph Expo is more notable for being the only show in the U.S.andO;(along with Print) at which dot-generating scanners are introduced.andP;  Twoyears ago there was the A.B.andP;  Dick scanner.andP;  This year there was the Isometunit--a new high-resolution, dot-generating scanner based on the PDI scanner.andO;Isomet has added some new features intended to enhance ease of use.andM;Crosfield brings Solo and Duet to U.S.andM;Crosfield brought its new Solo and Duet scanners to Graph Expo for theirofficial U.S.andP;  unveiling.andP;  As we mentioned in our introduction of theproducts in July (Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  19/20), Crosfield has taken note of Hell'smove toward off-line setup stations and added multiple analyzers to onerecorder.andP;  Crosfield offers two preview monitors, QuickView and ScanView,that offer visual feedback during the analyzing process.andM;Isomet: one more into the frayandM;Isomet, based in Springfield, Virginia, is probably best known for supplyingcomponents used in the Itek Colour Graphics scanner line and in someDainippon Screen products, but its history goes back much farther than that.andO;It was formed in 1956, with a stated purpose of producing isotopes, raremetals and optical crystals.andP;  Lately it has focused on the design,development and high-volume manufacture of acousto-optic laser controlcomponents.andM;Besides its association with Itek and DS, Isomet is known for its involvementin the development of a line of scanners for PDI (Print Developments, Inc.),andO;including the 255 and 355 analog color units and the 155 monochrome device,plus laser recorders that have been characterized by their use of fourheads--one to record each color separation simultaneously.andP;  Although most ofits developments have been for equipment being sold by other companies, ithas been selling a color-separation scanner of its own, primarily in Europe.andM;Isomet currently has three overseas subsidiaries: Printing Development IsometLtd. in London, Isomet Laser Systems Ltd. in Wales and Isomet Japan in Tokyo.andM;Products shown.andP;  At Graph Expo, Isomet demonstrated its digital colorscanner, called the 455I, which replaces the mixed analog/digital 355 unit.andO;Part of the 455I demonstration was the nice user interface and a newMultiscan program for economizing on use of film by the recorder.andM;Also new was a smaller-format recorder that sports only two writing heads butcan record four separations in one pass.andP;  The other system in the booth wasthe latest version of the four-head recorder that we used to see as the PDIplotter at shows early in the 1980s.andM;Isomet also offers a $20,000 Color View 400 online color preview for use withthe 455 scanner.andP;  Used in conjunction with the 455's quick-scan feature, theColor View 400 displays the preview on its 512 X 512 color monitor.andP;  Then,after changes are made by means of the scanner keyboard, the new version canbe displayed.andP;  The operator can view both the changed version and theoriginal for comparison.andM;The 455 scanner.andP;  We reported in depth on the new 455 input and output unitswhen they were announced last summer (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  22, p. 23), so wewill only summarize their features here and add a few comments on newdevelopments.andP;  The 455 scanner, which supports three sizes of drum and ascaling range of 12.5% to 3,200%, uses an 80286-bases PC as a controller.andP;  Ithas one lens and two light sources: one for transparencies and one forreflective copy.andP;  Multiple originals can be mounted and scanned in one pass,up to a maximum total size of 20&quot; X 24&quot;.andP;  A 10X visual display is providedfor selecting the starting location for scanning.andP;  The speed control formoving the assembly into position is continuously variable.andM;The operator handles job setup and scanner functions through a series ofeasy-to-use pull-down menus.andP;  Some features are automated, such as setting upscaling factors, where the operator specifies any two parameters from amongthe input size, the output size and the percentage, and the systemautomatically calculates the third parameter.andP;  Focusing is also doneautomatically as the scanner handles multiple images in one pass.andM;All adjustments are made through the PC keyboard.andP;  To adjust tonal values,the screen provides a graph with four points that can be moved.andP;  As we notedpreviously, the 455 handles undercolor removal, gray-component replacement,unsharp masking, screen rulings from 60 lpi to 300 lpi, and a variety ofscreen angles (0 [degrees], 15 [degrees], 30 [degrees], 45 [degrees], 60[degrees], 75 [degrees] and rotation for flexo and rotation for halftonegravure).andP;  Up to 16 scanner setup programs can be stored for later use withdifferent applications or press configurations.andM;A prescan takes about 25 seconds.andP;  Then, after adjustments are made at thekeyboard, it takes two to three seconds to refresh the screen with the newvalues.andP;  The normal scanning speed is 40 seconds per inch, regardless ofresolution and regardless of whether the original is being scanned as aphotograph or as line art.andM;The Multiscan layout program enables the operator to position up to 16 imageson one piece of film to optimize use of space.andP;  As with most other parts ofthe program, this is done in an easy manner using the monitor and keyboard.andO;Images can be positioned within 0.1mm accuracy.andP;  Images that are the samesize can be duplicated.andP;  The one limitation in the placement capability isthat it isn't possible to rotate images; they must be placed in actualorientation.andM;The 455I scanner costs $159,000 alone, $270,000 with the 455M recorder or$210,000 with the 455S.andM;Isomet reported that it had sold two 455 scanners already, including one toProcolor, in California, which also purchased a 455M four-head recorder.andM;The recorders.andP;  The companion output recorders are the 455M and the 455Shigh-resolution plotters.andP;  These machines share most of their specifications,but the larger 455M is more productive, since its four laser imaging headscan lay down four separations of up to 20&quot; X 24&quot; each in parallel.andP;  Toachieve this, the argon-ion laser beam is split four ways--one for each head.andO;The laser assembly moves horizontally across the film at the rate of eightmicrodots for each revolution of the drum.andP;  Since the drum is revolving at arate of 500 revolutions per inch, the effective output resolution is 4,000dpi (500 revolutions X eight dots per revolution).andP;  To compensate for skewingas a result of the continuous movement in two directions, an adjustment ismade in the angle of motion.andM;The total time to record four separations, according to Isomet, is as littleas 13 minutes.andM;A new feature now offered with the 455M is the ability to produce line workat a resolution of 4,000 dpi and images at the normal screen ruling on thesame piece of film.andM;The 455S recorder uses two heads and can record either one separation of upto 20&quot; X 24&quot; in size at a time, or four separations simultaneously byarranging them on the drum as four 10&quot; X 12&quot; pages on a sheet of 20&quot; X 24&quot;film.andP;  The time to output a full piece of film on the 455S is 13 minutes.andM;Both machines offer the standard choices of round, square, and ellipticaldots, and both also offer a special gravure dot and a &quot;random&quot; dot, whichreduces moire patterns when dealing with patterned images such as wovencloth.andM;The recorders are available as slave output units for highend color systems.andM;Isomet also offers a machine with a single head for monochrome recording, butthat wasn't demonstrated.andM;The market and the strategy.andP;  In our earlier article, we asked if there is amarket for a new high-end color scanner.andP;  Although we can't answer thequestion yet--it's too soon to judge the audience's reaction to the Isometunits--we can report Isomet's answer.andM;Isomet hopes to capitalize both on the large replacement market it envisionsand on the likelihood that there will be a group of new customers forstandalone scanners.andP;  In both cases, it will have to demonstrate advantagesover its competitors.andP;  Included in its advantages, Isomet says, are awillingness to interface to anybody and an ease of use that other scannersdon't provide.andP;  Both are important issues, and we were impressed by the easeof use demonstrated with the 455 input unit.andP;  If the market for qualityscanners is to be enlarged significantly, the products sold will have to beeasy enough to use to attract people with relatively low skill levels.andO;Isomet may reach some of them, provided its sales force is up to the task.andM;Isomet also announced a plan to cooperate in the development of an interfacebetween its 455 scanner and Scip's Magic Touch color system.andM;A.B.andP;  Dick/ITek Colour Graphics in U.S.andM;The main news from Itek Colour Graphics wasn't its equipment, various piecesof which had been shown at IPEX, Type-X or IFRA.andP;  The news was in the area ofadministration and distribution.andM;First, A.B.andP;  Dick, which acquired Itek Colour Graphics in the summer of 1988,announced that it is opening a U.S.andP;  office for the UK-based company.andP;  (Seethe Latest Word for details.)andM;Second, as we reported in Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  4, the U.S.andP;  distributor for thecolor scanner line has been acquired: RZ Color Systems was acquired byDiadem.andP;  (See the Latest Word for commentary on the new situation.)andM;Intergraph offers 400-dpi scannerandM;Intergraph introduced a 400-dpi color scanner as part of its new thrust intothe color market.andP;  The flatbed, 11&quot; X 17&quot; 1140C scanner recognizes 256 levelsof grayscale or color data per pixel at resolutions of 150, 200, 300 or 400dpi.andM;Through scanning software, images may be saved in RLE, COT, CCITT Group 4 orTIFF formats, as well as in Intergraph's own format.andM;The scanner, which is currently available, costs $15,000.andM;Color Film RecordersandM;If there is a trend in the recorder business, it is that graphic artssuppliers, rather than presentation graphics vendors, are driving the market.andO;The new recorders, whether they be the Color-Setter 2000 from Optronics, theDISC machine acquired by Barco or the New Coulter recorder, are designed withthe prepress market in mind.andP;  Spurring this trend is the acquisition ofpresentation graphics vendors by graphic arts companies (Dicomed by Crosfieldand Matrix by Agfa).andM;Another obvious trend not evident at Graph Expo is the addition of PostScriptRIPs to film recorders.andP;  At the high end of the prepress market, vendorsdrive film recorders directly from their color system.andP;  But in the moregeneral market, the addition of a PostScript RIP enables the vendor to tie arecorder to virtually all new color software.andM;Coulter resurfacesandM;After disappearing for a few years, Coulter has resurfaced with a color filmrecorder developed in conjunction with a newly acquired imaging firm,Eotronics.andP;  The new machine, which we covered in a news story in our previousissue, is being targeted to the OEM market.andP;  See our previous coverage fordetails.andM;DISC/Barco shows laser recorderandM;DISC, the Belgian firm now part of the Barco group, demonstrated its D 3800laser film recorder that was introduced at IPEX last year but was making itsU.S.andP;  debut.andP;  Not shown was the anticipated PostScript capability.andM;Barco also announced that it had successfully merged the two companies underthe same management.andP;  (See the Latest Word for details.)andM;The D 3800 records on film loaded around a drum, using a beam splitter toproduce four laser beams to image film 31.4&quot; wide by 43.2&quot; around thecircumference of the drum.andP;  The speed to image the entire film is good: 7minutes (4.8&quot;/min.) at 1,000 dpi, 14 minutes (2.4&quot;/min.) at 2,000 dpi and 28minutes (1.2&quot;/min.) at 4,000 dpi.andP;  Accuracy is quoted as 1/4 2 mils over theentire film--easily within the accepted tolerances for color separation work.andM;The machine uses two 68030 processors and one 68010.andP;  It supports anautomatic film loader/unloader that can be run in unattended mode.andP;  Up to 50sheets can be held in the input and output cassettes.andP;  Film is picked up bysuction and held in place by a vacuum process and sprockets.andP;  DISC says itwill offer an online connection to a processor in the future.andM;The D 3800 costs $250,000 in the U.S.andM;DISC's previous laser recorder, called the D 3600, was a two-beam system.andO;The company's other unit, the D 3700, images the same size film as the 3600(25&quot; X 20.5&quot;), but it uses the same RIP and optics as the D 3800.andP;  It takesthe 3700 unit 3.5 minutes to image a piece of film at 1,000 dpi.andM;Kodak LVT out the doorandM;Light Valve Technologies (LVT) is a small company with a unique imagingtechnology that it uses a new color film recorder.andP;  The company has beenacquired by Kodak, but it still operates independently.andM;The LVT recorder is based on a unique mechanism.andP;  It involves the convergenceof red, green and blue beams of variable-strength light.andP;  The beams arefiltered and combined via dichroic mirrors.andP;  Together, the beams produce asingle spot of variable color and intensity, which is used to create theimage on a rotating drum.andP;  The light source is three tungsten-halogen lamps.andO;The intensity of their light is varied with three light valves, one for eachcolor.andM;A light valve is made of a transparent crystal (a compound of lead,lanthanum, Zir conate and titanate--plzt for short) capable of changing thepolarity of light passing through it.andP;  The change is proportional to theapplied voltage.andP;  Two polarizing filters, oriented so as to let light passthrough freely, are placed on either side of the PLZT crystal.andP;  When novoltage is applied, the light passing through the first polarizer goes onthrough the crystal and out through the second polarizer without attenuation.andO;But when a voltage is applied to the PLZT crystal, the polarity of the lightpassing through it is shifted, and the light is partly or totally stopped bythe second polarizer.andP;  Thus, the light valve translates a voltage change intoa change in the amount of light that is allowed to pass.andM;The appeal of this technology is its simplicity.andP;  It avoids the need forprecise registration that is required if the three colors must be recordedsequentially; it uses an inexpensive light source; and it works withconventional tungsten-balanced photographic film.andP;  According to Kodak, thissimplicity allows LVT recorders to be less expensive to make and to operatethan units involving lasers or sequential recording of colors.andM;There are other distinctions, too.andP;  The LVT recorder images Ektacolor Plus orDouble Check position proofing paper as well as Ektachrome 64T color filmsheets.andP;  Stocks are sheet-fed in sizes up to 16&quot; X 20&quot;.andP;  The unit is astandalone device that accepts data from magnetic tapes in Scitex CT2T,Crosfield, Hell and Quantel formats, and it includes its own built-incalibration routine.andM;LVT began shipping its recorder in limited volume this pas spring.andP;  Kodaksays it has now installed 13 units in the field: 10 in the U.S.andP;  and 3 inEurope.andP;  The list price of the standard unit is $237,000.andM;LVT, 100 King's Highway, Suite 1400, Rochester, NY 14617; phone (716)724-1111; fax 724-9862.andM;MacDonald Dettwiler adds calibrationandM;MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates makes imaging devices and systems for manyapplications.andP;  In the graphic arts, this has meant recorders for producingproofs and &quot;second originals.&quot;andP;  MDA used to offer the Fire 300, whichproduced images on Polaroid material.andP;  That met with limited success becauseof the resolution limitations of the Polaroid process.andP;  Now the principalproduct is the Fire 1000, which records &quot;second original&quot; transparencies onEktachrome film.andM;About 120 Fire 1000s have been installed, about half in the graphic arts.andP;  Ofthese, about half have been sold through an OEM arrangement with Crosfield,which offers the recorder as the Magnatran, a peripheral to its Studio colorsystems.andM;Three enhancements to the Fire 1000 were announced: a new SCSI interface, aPC-based calibration application, and an improved color transform package.andO;The SCSI interface makes it easier to connect the recorder to a variety ofcomputers.andM;The calibration software and transform package are part of MDA's approach togetting consistent, accurate color out of the Fire 1000.andP;  Until now,calibration has meant imaging a test pattern onto film, processing it andtaking a series of densitometer readings.andP;  These readings have involved agray scale and a series of 512 color patches: all possible combinations ofeight levels of RGB.andP;  The measurements have been sent to a Vax at MDAheadquarters in Vancouver, BC, and color lookup tables have been sent backand loaded into the recorder.andP;  These tables govern the response of therecorder to inputs of RGB data.andM;This is cumbersome process, and it means that intermediate colors lyingbetween the eight steps (which are handled via interpolation) haven't alwaysbeen accurately rendered.andM;The new calibration process is more automatic and accurate.andP;  It begins with anew test pattern with 4,096 color patches (all combinations of 16 levels eachof red, green, and blue).andP;  The pattern is imaged to film and developed.andO;Instead of densitometer readings, MDA has developed a procedure for scanningthe test image on the input scanner of the system driving the Fire recorder.andO;The data derived from this process is fed into a PC, which does thecalculations necessary to build the lookup table.andP;  This avoids the need toinvolve the Vax and makes the calibration process a local one.andM;Existing Fire 1000s can be upgraded with these features.andM;The price of the Fire 1000 is about $200,000.andP;  The direct interface to Scitexis extra.andM;MacDonald Dettwiler Technologies, Electro Optical Division, 501-13231 DelfPlace, Richmond, BC V6V 2C3, Canada; phone (604) 273-7730; fax 273-2775.andM;Digital ProofingandM;We do not cover the bulk of the color proofing systems on the market, becausethey are not driven by computers.andP;  Exceptions have been the Iris ink-jetprinter and the Hell Chromacom, both of which were at Graph Expo but had nonew developments.andP;  (Iris has developed a new large-format version of itsprinter, but we didn't see it at the show).andP;  The Iris unit, incidentally, isnow sold under the Crosfield label as the Jetproof.andP;  Iris also has acooperative marketing agreement with Scitex.andM;Du Pont: EMP from DX ImagingandM;Du Pont is the leading supplier of graphic arts proofing systems, and itfully intends to retain that position in the 1990s.andP;  Like IBM in the computerfield, Du Pont believes that it need not always be the first to introduce newtechnology.andP;  What is more important is that any new technology it introduces,is a fully deliverable product that meets Du Pont's customer expectations fora Du Pont product.andM;This philosophy is evident in Du Pont's stance toward direct digitalproofing.andP;  Several years ago, the company formed a joint venture with Xerox,called DX Imaging, which was to develop electronic color printing technologybased on liquid electrostatic toners.andP;  Two years ago, Du Pont brought aprototype analog proofer developed by DX Imaging to Graph Expo for privateviewings.andP;  There was considerable inerest in the product.andP;  Since then, thingshave been quiet on the proofing front in Wilmington.andP;  (The company has beenbusy making headlines with one acquisition after another.)andP;  Perhaps all tooquiet, as rumors surfaced that DX Imaging would not have its digital productready for Drupa.andM;Du Poont tried to allay concerns about its direct digital efforts bydiscussing an analog proofing system developed by DX Imaging that will makeuse of the liquid toner technology.andP;  This device, called EMP, is the one thatDu Pont hopes to launch in May, with deliveries to follow by the end of 1990.andO;But Du Pont brushed aside questions about direct digital contract proofs,saying it is in no hurry to show immature products at Drupa--or any othershow for that matter.andM;EMP.andP;  The Electrostatic Master Proofer (EMP) is like a small printing press.andO;A rotary color imaging station exposes four pieces of film used to charge aphotoconductor, which in turn is inked with liquid electrostatic toners.andP;  Theink is then transferred to the paper.andP;  The process takes about 7 minutes forthe first proof; subsequent proofs take about 1 minute apiece.andM;The quality of EMP, judging from the samples at the show, will be suitablefor contract proofs--closer to what the final printed piece will be than aCromalin, Du Pont's current contact-level proofing system.andP;  Cromalin will bepositioned as &quot;critical&quot; color--a proof used to get initial client approvalin color-critical applications.andM;EMP is a large and costly unit.andP;  The payback for customers, Du Pont hopes,will be in speed and cost per multiple copies.andP;  Cromalins take as long as 30minutes per proof, and they are expensive and slow for multiple copies.andP;  Theconsumables for EMP, on the other hand, will be in the ballpark of $60 forthe first proof, with the consumable costs of multiple copies dropping toabout 10% of the first proof.andP;  Because it produces multiple copies quickly,EMP would be useful in publication advertising, where an ad is run in avariety of publications that are produced on different presses at differentlocations.andP;  Du Pont plans to make the liquid toners conform to SWOP standardsto serve that market.andM;Direct digital.andP;  Du Pont's current direct digital proofer, 4Cast, is a dyesublimation transfer printer used for comprehensives, although now that DuPont has added lookup tables for its Scitex interface, the color matching isbetter than that of most electronic printers.andP;  Du Pont says that it has soldmore than 80 units, but that interest has picked up considerably since itintroduced a PostScript RIP for the device.andM;The unanswered question is when DX Imaging will complete its direct digitalproofer, which should become the flagship proofing product for Du Pont in the1990s.andP;  It is unlikely to be at Drupa.andP;  Du Pont declined to make any definitetime commitments.andP;  It is playing this one with caution.andM;Kodak: whole new proofing systemandM;Kodak's Signature is an analog proofing system that uses liquid tonertechnology.andP;  Two year ago, Kodak was showing samples produced by a digitalversion.andP;  But in the last two years, Kodak has found it difficult to developa direct-digital proofing device using that technology that wasn'tprohibitively expensive.andM;Earlier this year, Kodak abandoned the use of liquid electrophotography forits digital proofer and embarked on an ambitious new project to produce adirect digital machine using an alternative technology.andP;  Kodak still believesthat liquid electrophotography is the technology of choice for analogproofing.andM;At Graph Expo, it unveiled a prototype of the new machine, although it wasnot operational at the show.andM;Kodak was unwilling to say much about the device, except that it is alaser-based recorder that will have its own RIP.andP;  This is in direct contrastto the approach of most systems, which will have the prepress systemrasterize the page for them.andP;  To supply such a RIP, we believe Kodak willhave to negotiate licensing terms on the color halftoning patents Hell nowholds.andP;  Kodak says it will tell all next spring at Drupa.andM;Polaroid: no new systemandM;Visitors to Polaroid's large booth were startled to find no products ondisplay, and only a skeleton crew in the booth.andP;  This was to have been theshow at which Polaroid introduced its new direct digital proofing system.andM;It is our understanding that Polaroid decided not to show its proofer underthreat of legal action by Du Pont.andP;  Du Pont evidently believes thatPolaroid's product involves technology covered by Du Pont patents.andP;  Therewere discussions between the two companies before Graph Expo, and, up untiltwo days before the show, it still seemed possible that the proofer would beshown.andP;  But an agreement was not reached.andP;  Polaroid still expects to get itsproduct to market, but the patent issues will have to be resolved first.andM;Stock: first with high-quality digitalandM;Stork Colorproofing kicked off its U.S.andP;  launch by dropping a bombshell: thefirst high-quality direct digital proofer capable of producingcontract-quality proofs.andP;  We covered the details of the Stork proofer in anews story in last issue's Latest Word section (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  5, p. 35).andM;It is too early to assess the impact this proofer will have on the U.S.andO;market, but Stork has already sold more than half a dozen machines in Europe.andO;More important, by being first, Stork has set a standard that the moreestablished proofing vendors will be expected to meet or surpass with theirown products.andP;  Customers will now have a point of comparison when looking atthe digital proofers that will be unveiled at Drupa.andM;3M: 'On schedule for Drupa'andM;We have covered the joint project between 3M and Hell to develop a directdigital proofing device since its inception two years ago (see Vol, 17, No.andO;13, p. 6).andP;  At Graph Expo, 3M said that the device is &quot;now entering thecommercialization phase,&quot; and that it fully expects to launch it next springat Drupa.andP;  The sample proofs in its booth were excellent in quality and werevirtually indistinguishable from the Matchprint II proofs of the same images.andM;Rather than show a prototype machine, 3M was positioning its product andtalking about issues and benefits of digital proofing to soften the stickershock its (and, for that matter, most other) digital proofers will cause.andO;The 3M digital proofer will be a complement to 3M's Matchprint II proofingsystem.andP;  At this time, 3M is not planning to offer an intermediate prooferthat would compete with the 4Cast or Iris printers.andP;  Its machine will producea halftone proof, including text and line art as well as color images andtints, that will be contract quality.andM;3M was urging its customers to consider all of the factors--speed, format,consistency, control and ability to meet proofing standards--before jumpingto any conclusions about cost effectiveness.andM;3M did reveal one aspect of the new system--its user interface will besortware written for a Mac II.andP;  For more details, we'll have to wait untilits formal launch next spring.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
