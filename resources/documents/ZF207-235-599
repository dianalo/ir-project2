 One of the largest groups is theHouston Area League of PC Users (HAL-PC).andP;  A few dozen computer enthusiastsorganized HAL-PC in 1982.andP;  Today more than 8,000 fill the roster, and newmembers join at the rate of more than 100 a month.andP;  As many as 40% of themmake a living using a PC.andM;With that kind of clout, when HAL-PC has something to say, the industrylistens.andP;  HAL-PC's general monthly meetings draw an audience of from 2,000 to2,500 people, and speakers have included Microsoft Chairman William Gates,Borland International Chairman Philippe Kahn, and Compaq Computer Corp.andO;President Rod Canion.andP;  HAL-PC also boasts a 100-page monthly newsletter,three 24-hour electronic bulletin boards, and approximately 40 activespecial-interest groups (SIGs).andP;  Betty Brooks, a Houston computer consultantand coordinator of HAL-PC's Lotus SIG, recently spoke to reporter Lindsy VanGelder about what makes HAL-PC tick.andM;LOTUS: What has made HAL-PC so successful?andM;B.andP;  B.: A couple of factors contributed to its success.andP;  Early on, the grouphad a great software library.andP;  Also, HAL-PC bought disks in volume and soldthem to members at cost.andP;  Eventually, the group bought from 20,000 to 30,000disks a month.andP;  Another major offering is our newsletter, which in my opinionis one of the best in the country.andP;  Our editor was the first to organize thedisk-exchange program [that enables user-group newsletters across the countryto reprint each other's articles].andP;  We have a lot of industrious people and aboard that strives to grow and change with the needs of the group.andM;HAL-PC works hard to get people to attend meetings.andP;  Recently, for example,we had two software &quot;shootouts&quot;--one for spreadsheets and one for wordprocessors--to compare competitive products.andP;  I think the Boston ComputerSociety has as many members as we do, but a lot of them are primarily membersby mail.andP;  In terms of attendance, we're by far the largest.andP;  Our sizeattracts vendors to our meetings, which in turn brings in more members.andP;  It'skind of a chicken and egg thing.andM;LOTUS: Has the group changed during the five years you've been involved withit?andM;B.andP;  B.: Of course it has grown.andP;  In the beginning people got together in acafeteria.andP;  By the time I joined, we convened at a computer center, and themeetings were getting more crowded every time we met.andP;  We've had to relocateseveral times.andP;  The HAL-PC SIG now rents a big lecture hall that has aprojection system at the University of Saint Thomas.andP;  A different SIG meetsthere every night of the month.andM;Also, the members have become more knowledgeable and sophisticated.andP;  In theLotus SIG, members used to create small, simple templates.andP;  Now you hearpeople complain that their computers are running out of memory.andP;  They do moreprogramming, using Lotus macros.andM;LOTUS: What are some typical problems that users bring to the group,beginners or otherwise?andM;B.andP;  B.: Hardware connectivity is the biggest worry, especially gettingprinter drivers to work.andP;  A lot of questions concern laser printers.andP;  In theLotus SIG, another big problem is how to get macros to work.andM;LOTUS: Are there any problems that are particular to such a largeorganization?andM;B.andP;  B.: Because of its size, all of HAL-PC's general meetings are videotapedfor the local-access cable channel and are broadcast one day each month.andO;We're considering taping some of the SIG meetings too.andM;LOTUS: User groups are a unique phenomenon; we don't form groups for thepurpose of discussing our cars, for example.andP;  In the beginning there was aspecial need because people with no computer background were trying to copewith the technology and not getting a lot of support from their companies.andO;Is that still true?andM;B.andP;  B.: User groups became strong because the industry realized it had torespond to us.andP;  It also realized that a large group provides an opportunityto take the pulse of a cross section of computer users.andP;  If a vendor presentsa product here and it's not well received, chances are that it won't be wellreceived in the marketplace.andM;LOTUS: So HAL-PC members get a lot of advance information on products?andM;B.andP;  B.: The HAL-PC Lotus SIG was the first user group to see 1-2-3 Release 3.andO;I beta test many Lotus add-ins and other related products.andM;LOTUS: Do you also arrange software purchases?andM;B.andP;  B.: Sometimes, but it's difficult to get everyone to meet a deadline whendeciding what to buy.andM;LOTUS: What do you look for in a guest speaker?andM;B.andP;  B.: In the Lotus SIG, I don't want someone who is blatantly commercial.andO;My goal is to help people find out what kind of Lotus add-ins exist, whatthose products will do for them, and how they work.andM;LOTUS: Who won the spreadsheet shoot-out?andM;B.andP;  B.: Shoot-out may not be the best word for it because there was noclear-cut winner.andP;  Another member and I did pretty extensive benchmark testson four products.andP;  We used 1-2-3 Release 2.01 as a standard against whichMicrosoft Excel, Lucid 3-D, Surpass, and Quattro were tested.andP;  We invitedrepresentatives from each company to give a presentation at the meeting atwhich we released the test findings.andM;We tried to point out that what makes the &quot;best&quot; program depends on yourneeds.andP;  A light spreadsheet user who works mainly with some other product,such as a word processor, might prefer Lucid 3-D because it ismemory-resident and pops up only when you want to use it.andP;  But a heavy userwould get fairly frustrated with it.andP;  Quattro is cheaper and does a lot ofthe same things that 1-2-3 does, at least until Release 3 comes out.andP;  And ifyou want to produce polished, pretty documents without using an add-onprogram, maybe you'll go for Excel.andM;LOTUS: Are you planning to have another shoot-out when Release 3 is out?andM;B.andP;  B.: We'd love to, but you can't imagine how hard it is to coordinatethese events--getting five people from five companies in the same place atthe same time.andP;  However, it's a great way for people to decide what to buy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
