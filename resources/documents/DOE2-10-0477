<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0477 </DOCNO><TEXT>Positive and negative ion modes (PI and NI, respectively) have been employedfor the characterization of 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol,pentachlorophenol, Linuron and Cyanazine in thermospray (TSP) liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The PI mode showed no responsewhen 200 ng of the different chlorophenols were injected, while for Linuronand Cyanazine high signals were obtained with [M+NH/sub 4/]/sup +/ and[M+acetic acid]/sup +/ ions as base peaks, respectively. With the NImode, the base peak usually corresponds to the [M-H]/sup -/ ion, withbetter sensitivities for the chlorophenols than for the herbicides. Thechloride adduct [M+Cl]/sup -/ ion was also obtained for 2,4,5-trichlorophenoland for Linuron. Although the PI mode is more sensitive than the NI modefor the two herbicides, the combination of both ionization modes offerscomplementary structural information for characterizing such compoundsin TSP LC-MS.</TEXT></DOC>
