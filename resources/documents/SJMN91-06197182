Asriver beds rose from silting, peasants raised the dikes, until the dikes --and rivers -- towered over the surrounding countryside.;    &quot;There's nowhereto move the people. There's water everywhere,&quot; said Yin Tingmo, a localofficial in Liuhe, a farming region near Nanjing.;    A rise in the Yangtzeand Chu rivers could threaten many of the 42,000 refugees in makeshift tentson strips of land poking only a few feet above the floodwaters.;    The15-foot-wide embankment crowded with refugees was the only dry land left forseveral miles since flash floods last week. Two-thirds of Liuhe County'sfarmland was flooded.;    Villagers piled their few possessions in tents madefrom bamboo poles and plastic sheets. Some had carried tables or cabinets ontheir backs as they fled the water. Others saved bicycles, chickens or pigs.;   Few had salvaged any food, and relief workers brought boat loads of biscuitsand soda water Sunday. The villagers, mostly barefoot and mud-spattered,clustered around for the supplies.;    Many have fallen ill with diarrhea andskin infections from lack of clean water and poor sanitation, said army Dr. LiNing, who was performing checkups Sunday.;    The industrial cities ofNanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai all raised barriers inrecent days, preparing for the Yangtze River -- Asia's longest -- to reach anew crest.;    However, the river's crest passed Nanjing, the capital ofJiangsu province, without causing significant new flooding and headed forZhenjiang, the next major city downstream.;    There was no substantial newrainfall, but new storms hit Hubei and Hunan provinces in central China,Guizhou province in the south and the Daxing'anling Forest in the northeast,the China Daily newspaper said.;    Authorities were unable to provide acomprehensive death toll, but partial figures published by the China Dailybrought the figure to at least 1,697.;    Chinese casualty counts are rarelycomplete, in part because of poor communication with disaster-stricken areas.;   Chen Yingchen, an engineer in Nanjing's city water conservancy bureau, saidlevels of the Yangtze and other rivers around the city were beginning to dropgradually and no new flooding was expected unless heavy rains resume.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Nanjing, China  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910715  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  460  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 15, 199100197182,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
