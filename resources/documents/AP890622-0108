RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court ruled today the governmentmay confiscate from criminal defendants money and property theyintended to use to pay their legal fees.   The justices, in separate 5-4 votes in cases from Virginia andNew York, handed federal prosecutors a major victory in their fightagainst illegal drug dealing.   The court said a defendant's constitutional rights to due processand to be represented by a lawyer in a criminal case are notviolated when profits of an allegedly illegal enterprise are seized.   Justice Byron R. White, who wrote for the court in both cases,said no one has a constitutional right ``to spend another person'smoney for services rendered by an attorney, even if those funds arethe only way that that defendant will be able to retain the attorneyof his choice. The money, though in his possession, is notrightfully his.''   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and JusticesSandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``It isunseemly and unjust for the government to beggar those it prosecutesin order to disable their defense at trial.''   He said the court ``should heed the warnings'' of federal trialjudges who ``understand, perhaps far better than we, the devastatingconsequences of attorney's fee forfeiture for the integrity of ouradversarial system of justice.''   Blackmun was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, ThurgoodMarshall and John Paul Stevens.   In one case decided today, the law firm of Caplin andamp; Drysdale herewas denied $170,000 in legal fees for representing ChistopherReckmeyer. He pleaded guilty in 1985 in Virginia to charges stemmingfrom what prosecutors said was his role as kingpin of amulti-million-dollar drug operation.   Reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and was ordered toforfeit all proceeds from the drug deals. The seizure of the moneyleft him without funds to pay Caplin andamp; Drysdale.   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year thatReckmeyer was not entitled to use any of the money to reimburse thelaw firm.   In the second case, the former Reagan administration appealed aruling that would have allowed Peter Monsanto access to assets worth$400,000 to help him pay his lawyers.   Monsanto was convicted in New York City of charges he headed aheroin-selling ring.   The jury also had ordered him to forfeit to the government ahouse in Mount Vernon, N.Y., valued at $335,000, a $30,000cooperative apartment in the Bronx and $35,000 in cash.   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last yearMonsanto could use the assets to pay legal fees incurred in hisdefense.   At issue in both cases were forfeiture provisions of key federalcrime-fighting laws, including the Continuing Criminal EnterpriseAct and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations statute.   In other action, the court:   _ Gave cities important new protection against big damage awardswhen they are accused of violating people's civil rights.   By a 5-4 vote, the court narrowed the scope of a century-oldcivil rights law invoked by a former Dallas high school footballcoach who said he lost his job because he is white.   _ Unanimously upheld a $200,000 libel award against Harte-HanksCommunications. However, its ruling did not appear to weakensignificantly the news media's protection against libel lawsuits bypublic officials and public figures.   The justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled againstHarte-Hanks because of a 1983 article in the Hamilton, Ohio,Journal-News. But the decision also said the appeals court issued amisleading opinion about the standards of reporting andinvestigation by the media.   _ Made it easier for communities to turn down the volume on rockconcerts, upholding New York City's effort to avoid ear-splittingnoise levels in Central Park.   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said officials may require sponsorsof rock concerts in the park's Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell to use asound system operated by a city-designated engineer.   In one of the forfeiture cases, Caplin andamp; Drysdale and otherattorneys argued that confiscating the assets of people when theyare indicted will leave them too poor to pay their own lawyers.   But White today compared the plight of the accused drug dealer tothat of a robbery suspect.   A robbery suspect has no constitutional right ``to use funds hehas stolen from a bank to retain an attorney to defend him if he isapprehended,'' he said.   ``If defendants have a right to spend forfeitable assets onattorney's fees, why not on excercises of the (constitutional) rightto speak, practice one's religion or travel?'' White askedrhetorically.   Also, he said, a defendant's assets may be frozen beforeconviction if there is probable cause to believe the money orproperty was obtained illegally.   The forfeiture cases are Caplin andamp; Drysdale vs. U.S., 87-1729, andU.S. vs. Monsanto, 88-454.</TEXT></DOC>
