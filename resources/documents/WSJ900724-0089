He's been a federal judge for less thana year and has written very few federal opinions orlaw-review articles.   The point is that his paper trail is scant indeed, makingit tough for Senate liberals to Bork him. We're confidentthat as Judge Souter's state-court opinions go on publicdisplay, they'll demonstrate his credentials, and hisoriginal-intent jurisprudence. Yet the Bork lynchingcontinues to extract its toll; something's seriously amisswhen an unknown record becomes a huge advantage inWashington.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
