The Standard Newspaper wrote that Gibson Kamau Kuria hopes to behonored in absentia.   Kuria's passport was confiscated when he was detained Feb. 26,1987, a day after he filed a petition challenging the detentionwithout charge of two lawyers and a university lecturer.   Joseph P. Griffin, ABA chairman, invited Kuria to receive acitation for his ``work in promoting respect for and observance ofthe rule of law.'' He was to leave June 12 and return June 26.   Kuria told Griffin in a letter made available to The AssociatedPress that an immigration official had informed him the governmentonly returns held passports when it decides the holder can traveloutside Kenya.   ``That policy is in conflict with the Kenyan law which governsthe return of passports held by public authorities,'' Kuria said.   The Kenyan law requires that authorities repossess passportsonly for a specific reason and for a specified period.   Like his clients, Kuria was held under a law that allowsindefinite detention without charge.   President Daniel arap Moi freed Kuria Dec. 12, and the attorneyrejoined his partners in a Nairobi law firm.</TEXT></DOC>
