By the end of an exhausting trading day, however, oilprices were about where they had started.</LP><TEXT>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil forFebruary delivery was up nine cents a barrel at $27.26. OnLondon's International Petroleum Exchange, which handled arecord 53,000 contracts for crude, February Brent crude ended55 cents a barrel lower at $26.15.   The modest net changes, however, masked some of the mosterratic up-and-down moves ever for oil prices, as traders'perceptions changed during the day regarding the outlook forthe Persian Gulf crisis and the Geneva talks between U.S.Secretary of State James Baker and Iraqi Foreign MinisterTariq Aziz.   By day's end, some crude prices had made swings of morethan $7 a barrel. In hectic U.S. futures trading, forexample, February crude fell to $23.35 a barrel yesterdaymorning, the lowest since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Itthen rocketed to an intraday high of $31 a barrel after Mr.Baker said the Geneva talks had failed to bring any sign of apeaceful Gulf settlement.   &quot;It went up $7 in about 10 minutes, definitely the fastestmove I've ever seen,&quot; said Peter C. Beutel, director of theenergy group at Pegasus Econometric.   The market's preoccupation nearly all day was theU.S.-Iraqi discussions in Geneva. As the Baker-Aziz talksdragged on, oil prices began plummeting on a belief amongtraders that the two must have something to talk about andthat progress was being made toward peace in the Middle East.   But when the six-hour meeting ended in apparent failure,with no break in the deadlock over a United Nations ultimatumthat Iraq must pull out of Kuwait by next Tuesday, oil pricesrocketed upward. Mr. Baker's statement that he saw &quot;noflexibility&quot; on the part of Iraq was followed by the Iraqiforeign minister's own pessimistic evaluation of thesituation, contributing to the price surge.   With the rapid return of war fever, suggesting anew thepossibility of disruptions of oil supplies because any suchconflict would probably take place amid the world's richestoil fields, selling was converted into panic buying.   &quot;This puts a new firm undertone to the market, which cameto the realization that we have reached the ultimate level ofbrinkmanship by the Iraqis,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, Londonmanager of the international energy desk for Shearson LehmanBrothers.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of most wheat and soybeanfutures contracts rose slightly as fears of war in thePersian Gulf intensified, but corn prices slipped. Soybeansfor March delivery settled at $5.6650 a bushel on the ChicagoBoard of Trade, up 2.25 cents, and the March wheat contractwas up 2.5 cents at $2.5375 a bushel, while March corn fellone cent a bushel to $2.3175. Traders are generally confusedabout how grain prices might react if the U.S. and alliedforces go to war against Iraq, said Jonathan Will, an analystat Cargill Investor Services, Chicago. Many traders are tooyoung to have experienced a market during a major militaryconflict. Among other things, analysts are trying tocalculate whether ocean freight rates would jump enough toaffect trade, as well as whether higher oil prices wouldforce developing nations to cut back spending on U.S. crops.The Agriculture Department is due to release reports tomorrowon the size of U.S. fall crop harvests and on acreage seededby winter wheat farmers. Many analysts expect the reports toshow that winter wheat farmers planted fewer acres this yearas a result of lower prices and a government effort to getfarmers to diversify.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Prices swung wildly as Mideast peaceprospects seemed to fade. Gold was the most volatile; theFebruary contract dropped as low as $379.50 an ounce, off$12.80 from Tuesday's close, before rallying as Secretary ofState James Baker's news conference in Geneva began. Thecontract then rallied to $394.50 before closing at $393, up70 cents for the day. March silver dropped to $4.08 beforerallying to $4.175 late in the session, off 0.2 cent anounce. April platinum opened at its low for the day, $409 anounce, and closed at $412.90, up $2.20. Dinsa Mehta, chiefbullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York,characterized the price action as &quot;more Middle East rock androll.&quot; He said gold prices moved inversely with the length ofthe talks in Geneva. He added that because gold hasn't pushedhigher means that most traders don't believe that the onlyoutcome of the Persian Gulf situation is war. However, headded, &quot;If hostilities break out we would probably have anemotion-charged rally.&quot; August Arace, co-manager of theFreedom Gold andamp; Government Trust, an open-ended mutual fundthat invests in gold and government securities, said, &quot;I amstill betting that the secular condition is deflationary.&quot; Hesaid he is looking for both lower prices and lower interestrates. Jeffrey Christian, managing director of the CPM Group,a New York-based precious metals consulting company, saidthere are other factors bearing on the precious metals, &quot;butthey all take a back seat to the events in the Gulf.&quot; OneLondon bullion dealer said that he expected gold to sell formore than $400 an ounce in the near future, but &quot;at thatlevel many producers will off load metal.&quot; Some producerstold bullion dealers in London to phone them in the middle ofthe night if gold reaches the $400 level. David Gulley, adirector of the World Gold Council, a trade body of Westernproducers, reported that gold imports into Dubai rose 22% inthe fourth quarter of 1990 from 1989 levels. Initially, afterIraq invaded Kuwait in August gold imports into Dubai fellsharply. Then late in 1990 supplies started to arrive fromsome surprising sources including the U.S., Ethiopia andCyprus. According to Mr. Gulley, demand has been so brisk inDubai that prices for gold there are trading at $1 to $10 anounce above the world price.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: A rally attempt failed and the Marchcontract finished at $1.1190 a pound, off 0.65 cent. Thesoonest-to-expire January contract opened stronger becausethere were no notices of intent to deliver frozen concentratepresented to holders of long positions. January settled at$1.1385 a pound, up 0.85 cent. According to Esther Eskenasy,an orange juice trader at Cargill Investors Services Inc. inNew York, the absence of delivery notices reflects near-termsupply tightness. Ms. Eskenasy said that when the Marchcontract rallied it encountered considerable resistance justbelow the $1.15 level. She said that the $1.17 price levelrepresents overhead resistance for the January contract. &quot;Ibelieve that participants in the orange juice trade aresellers of the March contract as the market approaches thisresistance price {$1.15},&quot; she said. She also noted that thelatest report on positions held by hedgers and speculatorsshow that both types of traders are abandoning both long andshort positions. Ms. Eskenasy speculated that because ofevents in the Middle East many traders would close out marketpositions by the weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
