SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Joint Chiefs of Staff have sent the WhiteHouse a list of military hardware that President Bush could send toColombia if that country seeks such aid in its war against drugs,sources say.   The Joint Chiefs met Thursday to draw up the list, which includesUH-1 ``Huey'' troop transport helicopters, ammunition and radioequipment, said a military source who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Top U.S. and Colombian officials were expected to meet inWashington to discuss how the two nations can cooperate in theanti-drug battle.   An administration source, who also spoke on condition ofanonymity, stressed that no U.S. military personnel were included inthe Joint Chiefs' suggestions.   This, he said, was in line with Bush's complaint that talk ofsuch an idea had gotten ``out of whack.''   Colombian President Virgilio Barco has also rejected the idea ofseeking U.S. troops.   The administration official said Bush could do other things tohelp Colombia in its battle against drug terrorists _ such asoffering training to members of the Colombian military and policeforces. But, he cautioned, ``we aren't going to do anything unlessthe Colombians say they want it.''   The military source said the U.S. helicopters _ which were widelyused in the Vietnam war and are being replaced by the moresophisticated Blackhawk choppers _ must be flown by Colombian pilotssince no U.S. personnel will be involved.   No precise numbers were disclosed, but the source said the amountof helicopters that could be provided was ``not extravagant.''   The administration source said the list was not a formalrecommendation, but instead provides the president with ``a laundrylist of items that the Pentagon could provide if called upon to doso.''   The official said the Pentagon's suggestions came amid thoseoffered by other agencies, such as a $2 million Justice Departmentprogram designed to help Colombia protect judges and other officialsthreatened by the drug cartel.   The military source noted that the Joint Chiefs' list is over andabove the aid provided to Colombia through the Foreign MilitarySales program.   Under the FMS program, the Defense Department has sold Colombia'sgovernment almost $210 million worth of military goods and servicessince 1963, Pentagon officials said Thursday.   The focus of the sales have been the helicopters, ammunition,spare parts and support for the choppers.   The Colombian government has requested that the Export-ImportBank provide a loan guarantee for approximately $200 million, andthe proceeds of loans obtained under the guarantee would financeadditional FMS purchases for the counter-narcotics programs, thePentagon said.   Colombia is expected to purchase additional UH-60 and UH-1helicopters, patrol boats, rifles, machine guns, ammunition,vehicles and spare parts as part of this program, the Pentagon said.   In the 1988 fiscal year, a total of 775 Colombian militarypersonnel were trained under the International Military Educationand Training program, while 898 Colombian military received suchtraining so far this fiscal year, the Pentagon said.</TEXT></DOC>
