The analytic technique previously usedto study electric field induced emittance growth for immersed sourcebeams is extended to include solenoid fringing field effects in the presentwork. These results have application to industrial induction acceleratorsand to high brightness Free Electron Laser drivers. 1 ref., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
