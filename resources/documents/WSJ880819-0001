Accepting the Republican presidential nomination in the most crucial speech of his quarter-century political career, the vice president portrayed the Massachusetts governor and Democratic nominee as a liberal in moderate's clothing, a pessimist who sees the U.S. as headed for &quot;an inevitable fall.&quot;    Addressing the GOP convention here, Mr. Bush depicted himself as a can-do optimist, a former torpedo-bomber pilot who sees life &quot;in terms of missions -- missions defined and missions completed.&quot;    &quot;The most important work in my life,&quot; he said, &quot;is to complete the mission we started in 1980,&quot; when he and President Reagan were elected. He called himself the underdog in the coming contest.    Last month, jeering Democratic convention delegates in Atlanta demanded to know &quot;Where was George?&quot; during some of the Reagan administration's deliberations. Last night, Mr. Bush addressed an even more fundamental question: Who is George? Long a contradiction in terms -- the man with the golden resume, yet one who was said to have &quot;left no footprints&quot; as vice president -- he offered the nation a detailed look at who he is and what he stands for.    His speech seemed deliberately crafted to contrast with the more vague approach of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.    &quot;I may not be the most eloquent,&quot; he said, &quot;but I learned early that eloquence won't draw oil from the ground. I may sometimes be a little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious in my love of country. I am a quiet man -- but I hear the quiet people others don't. . . . I hear them, and I am moved, and their concerns are mine.&quot;    The vice president promised that he'll adamantly oppose any tax increases, even ad-libbing that, should Congress push him, he'll direct Congress to &quot;read my lips -- no.&quot; He also set a &quot;mission&quot; for a Bush presidency, the creation of 30 million jobs over the next eight years. The Reagan Administration created 13 million new jobs in the first seven years.    Moving and indeed eloquent at times, more than a month in the making, the address reflected the multiple tasks facing GOP strategists as Mr. Bush moves into the fall campaign.    Most urgent was an exercise in damage control. The vice president faced a convention hall filled with delegates dismayed, even stunned, by the fumbling debut of running mate Dan Quayle. Mr. Bush was struggling to re-energize a campaign jeopardized by troubling allegations -- the kind that quickly transformed Walter Mondale's running mate, Geraldine Ferraro, from an asset to a liability in 1984.    It became known yesterday that young Mr. Quayle, scion of a prominent publishing family, used family connections to get into the Indiana National Guard -- and thereby out of combat in Vietnam. This allegation was damaging enough, but it was Sen. Quayle's awkward, tentative answers to it that truly alarmed some GOP partisans here. Just hours before the convention was to formally nominate the vice presidential candidate, an early enthusiast, conservative Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich, was discussing with associates whether Sen. Quayle should be dumped.    The Quayle controversy dominated the airwaves and threatened to overshadow the Bush speech. But the vice president stuck by his choice. He called him &quot;a young leader&quot; who symbolizes &quot;the promise of the future.&quot; And he added: &quot;I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at my side.&quot;    Before a flag- and banner-waving throng, Sen. Quayle reciprocated. &quot;George Bush and Dan Quayle,&quot; he pledged, &quot;are going to add several bold new chapters to the story of the greatest nation God ever put on this earth.&quot;    Beyond their immediate crisis, Bush strategists must pump Mr. Bush up; a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll indicated 43% of likely voters hold negative impressions of him.    Last night, rather as Michael Dukakis talked of his immigrant roots, the blue-blooded vice president tried to humanize himself. He spoke of his early days in the west Texas oilfields. &quot;{We} lived in a little shotgun house, one room for the three of us. . . . In time we had six children. Moved from the shotgun to a duplex apartment to a house. Lived the dream -- high-school football on Friday night, Little League, neighborhood barbecue. . . . {We were} taking a chance and pushing into unknown territory with kids and a dog and a car.&quot;    At the same time, the Bush team must begin tearing Mr. Dukakis down. And the way they hope to do that is by emphasizing ideology over managerial competence -- exactly the opposite approach from what the Democratic candidate took in Atlanta.    Part of the strategy is to ridicule the vague, broadly thematic approach Gov. Dukakis has taken to the issues. Earlier yesterday, Mr. Bush compared his opponent to the stealth bomber.    &quot;I am running against a stealth candidate,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't see it. It doesn't show up on the radar screen.&quot; All the same, the vice president continued, Mr. Dukakis represents &quot;the failed liberal ideology of the past.&quot;    &quot;Some say this isn't an election about ideology,&quot; Mr. Bush said in his address to the convention, mocking a line from the Dukakis acceptance speech. &quot;Well, it's nice of them to want to play on our field. But . . . competence is a narrow ideal. Competence makes the trains run on time but doesn't know where they're going. Competence is the creed of the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesn't for a second understand the magic of the machine.    &quot;The truth is, this election is about the beliefs we share, the values we honor, the principles we hold dear.&quot;    Pounding home this theme, the vice president simultaneously wooed conservatives while slashing away at the values he said Mr. Dukakis holds.    &quot;Should public-school teachers be required to lead our children in the Pledge of Allegiance?&quot; Mr. Bush asked. &quot;My opponent says no -- but I say yes.&quot; (Gov. Dukakis, after receiving an advisory opinion from Massachusetts' highest court, vetoed a bill imposing such a requirement.)    &quot;Should free men and women have the right to own a gun to protect their home? My opponent says no -- but I say yes.&quot;    &quot;I'm the one who believes it is a scandal to give a weekend furlough to a hardened first-degree killer who hasn't even served enough time to be eligible for parole.    &quot;I'm the one who says a drug dealer who is responsible for the death of a policeman should be subject to capital punishment.&quot; He also attempted to draw distinctions between himself and his Democratic opponent on abortion and voluntary prayer.    And, however subtly, Mr. Bush and his strategists must draw some distinctions between him and President Reagan, who has often said that government is the problem and not the solution. &quot;I do not hate government,&quot; Mr. Bush said last night. &quot;A government that remembers that the people are its master is a good and needed thing.&quot;    He went on, in contrast to a President Reagan who worked unceasingly to cut many domestic spending programs, to promise a bigger Head Start program, aid to college-bound students, cleaner air and water and &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to move the disabled into the &quot;mainstream.&quot;    Turning to his economic views, Mr. Bush attempted to steer a deft and hazardous course: He managed to criticize the philosophy of Mr. Dukakis -- and, by implication, also the greed and corruption that have shaken Wall Street and tarnished the final Reagan years.    &quot;My opponent now says he'll raise {taxes} as a last resort, or a third resort,&quot; he declared. &quot;When a politician talks like that, you know that's the one resort he'll be checking into.&quot;    &quot;They {the Democrats} call it a Swiss-cheese economy,&quot; he continued in a rap on former President Jimmy Carter. &quot;Well, that's the way it may look to the three blind mice. But when they were in charge, it was all holes and no cheese.&quot;    The vice president continued: &quot;Some people who are enjoying our prosperity have forgotten what it's for. But they diminish our triumph when they act as if wealth is an end in itself. . . . The fact is, prosperity has a purpose. It is to allow us to pursue 'the better angels,' to give us time to think and grow.&quot;    But peace, he said, transcends even economics. And in detailing the administration's foreign-policy accomplishments, Mr. Bush paid tribute to Ronald Reagan: the man who catapulted him, then a failed GOP presidential candidate, back into the political big leagues by tapping him as running mate eight years ago.    &quot;We have a new relationship with the Soviet Union,&quot; he said. &quot;The INF treaty -- the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan -- the beginning of the end of the Soviet proxy war in Angola, and with it the independence of Namibia. Iran and Iraq move toward peace.&quot;    &quot;It is no accident. It happened when we acted on the ancient knowledge that strength and clarity lead to peace -- weakness and ambivalence lead to war. . . . I will not allow this country to be made weak again.&quot;    But the centerpiece of the address was the attempt by a man -- whose rhetoric sometimes has been derailed by malapropisms, whose public demeanor is occassionally marred by a giddy manner -- to project a measured image of dignity and purpose.    The principal speechwriter was Peggy Noonan, the author of Mr. Reagan's moving television address after the 1986 Challenger space shuttle disaster. And it was delivered by a man who had steeled himself to violate what he called &quot;an oasis of privacy&quot; and reserve that has marked much of his public life.    As he joked in an appearance earlier yesterday, Mr. Bush was ready last night to address the question: &quot;Who's the real you?&quot; And to speak &quot;with feeling, with demonstrable emotion.&quot;    And the principal purpose was to sum up, in a simple, moving way, a man's vision of himself and his country.    Mr. Bush did it this way: &quot;I seek the presidency to build a better America. It is that simple -- and that big.&quot;    He ended his address by leading the great crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance. Then, as the convention hall exploded into a sea of waving flags and cheering delegates, he was joined by his wife Barbara, children and grandchildren. Clouds of red, white and blue balloons showered down -- the largest indoor balloon drop ever -- and George Bush's triumphant evening ended with his former GOP rivals surrounding him on the podium. </TEXT></DOC>
