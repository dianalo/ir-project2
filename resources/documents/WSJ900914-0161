After strong 1989 net income growth of 33.6% to 194.6million Dutch guilders ($108.5 million) on sales of 17.6billion guilders, followed by 39% growth for the first halfof 1990, Ahold has the means to accomplish a largeacquisition.</LP><TEXT>   To maintain its strategy of balanced growth between theU.S. and Western Europe after two recent expansion moves inthe U.S., Ahold would prefer to acquire a large Europeangrocer that occupies one of the top slots in its market.   Unfortunately, there aren't any suitable candidates on themarket, according to Pierre Everaert, Ahold's president.   &quot;Why does it have to be a large corporation? Because, ifyou talk about Germany, unless you have between {$1.88billion and $3.14 billion in revenue}, you are just not aplayer. . . . The same applies elsewhere. You can be eitherfirst, second or third, but you have to have a certaincritical mass to be able to command the discounts and tocompete in the market,&quot; Mr. Everaert said.   However, opportunities do exist in the U.S., he said. &quot;Inthe U.S. we have 356 stores out of 36,000 supermarkets, sothe possibilities are obviously much greater {than inEurope}.&quot;   With the dollar scraping post-war lows against theguilder, U.S. businesses appear relatively inexpensive. Inaddition, a number of U.S. grocers may be ripe for plucking,the company asserted.   &quot;In the last 15 months or the last two years . . . 64{U.S.} corporations have either done their capitalrestructuring, or a leveraged buy-out, or a managementbuyout,&quot; Mr. Everaert said. With recession in certain areas,increased costs, and the difficulty of refinancing, &quot;we feelthat several of these companies would either be for sale orwould be looking for a financial partner who would bring inequity.&quot;   While there may be a wide range of potential targets tochoose from, Mr. Everaert said Ahold would seek to reinforceits existing position in the U.S., where it operates theBi-Lo, Giant Food Stores and First National Supermarketchains. The three chains mark off a triangular area of theU.S. roughly bound by Atlanta, Cleveland and Boston.   In the past, Ahold has expanded its U.S. operations bothby acquiring entire supermarket chains -- as in its 1988purchase of First National Supermarket -- or through thepurchase of clusters of stores. In 1989, Ahold purchased 21Kroger stores in North and South Carolina.   Specifically, Ahold wants to strengthen its grip on thePhiladelphia and Charlotte, N.C., areas, as well as itspositions in Connecticut and Long Island, N.Y.   &quot;There are quite a few cities where we are rather strong,but there are a lot of areas where we aren't No. 1 or No. 2,&quot;Mr. Everaert said. He said the company would prefer buyingeither a cluster of stores or buying a company with $1billion to $1.5 billion in revenue.   Analysts gave a favorable reaction to Ahold's acquisitionplans.   &quot;In the U.S., there are a number of companies that are indifficulties and, with the dollar so low, they could probablypick one up that is a pretty good bargain,&quot; said FionaMarshall, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Group in London.&quot;The only negative is that a U.S. acquisition increases theirdollar exposure.&quot; However, even considering the largerexposure to the dollar, she said, &quot;I am really quite positiveon Ahold.&quot;   As an alternative, Ahold may target an expansion effort inWestern Europe toward smaller businesses with annual revenueof between $200 million and $300 million.   Ahold said it could buy into an existing company, helpingthem to develop faster than they would by themselves. Mr.Everaert said he is looking for partnerships that could laterdevelop into 100%-owned subsidiaries. He cited Scandinavia orSpain as possible areas for expansion.   Toward this end, Ahold is considering deepening itspartnerships with members of the Associated MarketingServices, an alliance of Western European grocers thatincludes Ahold.   Through the European Retail Alliance, Ahold already hasmutual holdings with the Argyll Group of the U.K. and GroupeCasino of France -- neither of which are considered possibletargets by Ahold.   Mr. Everaert ruled out further expansion efforts inEastern Europe other than its alliance with theCzechoslovakian retailer Bramen Ostrava. Although Aholdsigned a letter of intent in June to work with BramenOstrava, the Dutch grocer is already finding their work cutout for them.   &quot;They are starting from zero. They are discovering freeenterprise, and there is a tremendous need for coaching, fortraining. So we have decided instead of doing a little bit inmany countries we will do one big bit in one country,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
