The three new machines are more than twice as fast ascompetitor models, Hewlett-Packard said. The computers usehigh-powered microprocessors called reduced instruction setcomputing, or Risc, chips.</LP><TEXT>   The workstations range in price from $11,900, for amachine capable of processing 57 million instructions asecond, to $43,190, for a system that can process 76 millioninstructions a second. The company's unveiling of the threenew computers had been expected.   Two years ago, Hewlett-Packard jumped to the lead in thecomputer workstation market when it acquired industry pioneerApollo Computer Inc. But Hewlett-Packard didn't keep pacewith competitors who offered faster Risc-based machines. Thecompany slipped to second, behind Sun Microsystems Inc., andfaced competition from International Business Machines Inc.,which entered the market last year.   Workstations, powerful desktop computers used mainly byengineers and scientists, are increasingly being purchased bywhite-collar workers who prefer them to personal computers.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Hewlett-Packard shares closed at $47.625 a share, up 37.5cents.</TEXT></DOC>
