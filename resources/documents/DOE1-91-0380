Compared with films, the Kodak storagephosphor technology described in the accompanying paper (1988, v. 266(1-3)p. 628) offers the prospect of greatly improved signal-to-noise, increasedsensitivity particularly at shorter wavelengths, and wide dynamic range,though with more modest spatial resolution. To assess the suitabilityof this technology for protein crystallographic data collection, we havecollected both monochromatic oscillation and wide bandpass Laue dataat CHESS on crystals ranging in unit cell size from {approx_equal} 50A (lysozyme) to {approx_equal} 300 A (viruses). A direct comparison ofthe Kodak storage phosphor with conventional Kodak Direct Exposure Film(DEF-5) was obtained by making immediately sequential exposures on thesame crystal with the two detector systems. Even with an exposure timeone order of magnitude less than with the corresponding film, the storagephosphor yielded data with improved signal-to-noise. Thus, storage phosphorsenable more data to be acquired per crystal, with less radiation damage,and with better precision. Such detectors appear extremely well suitedto protein crystallographic applications, both static and time-resolved,with both monochromatic and polychromatic X-ray sources.</TEXT></DOC>
