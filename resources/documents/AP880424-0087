The unexpected setback comes as Firestone shareholders prepareto vote Monday on a $2.6 billion buyout offer from BridgestoneCorp. of Japan, although Firestone said the GM move would notaffect the merger plans.   Firestone stated that it learned of GM's planned phaseout onFriday. There was no immediate comment from Bridgestone.   John J. Nevin, chairman and chief executive of Firestone, saidin a news release he was ``surprised and disappointed'' by GM'smove, but said Firestone was confident it would find other marketsfor its tires without hurting profits.   GM plans to reduce Firestone's role as a supplier significantlyduring the second half of this year, and will eliminate thetiremaker from its supply base over a period of up to two years,Firestone stated.   GM spokesman James Crellin said in a telephone interview inDetroit that the move was part of the automaker's ``ongoingsupplier-rationalization study'' _ a periodic review of suppliers'capacity and future needs _ and indicated it was not linked to theimpending buyout by Bridgestone.   ``We've got four other tire suppliers: General Tire, Goodyear,Michelin and Uniroyal-Goodrich,'' Crellin said. ``There are noplans to look for another supplier at this time. We will beinforming the other four tire suppliers of the availability ofincreased business.''   Crellin declined to say how long the phaseout would take andthat it was GM's policy not to discuss the amount of business itdoes with any suppliers.   GM's biggest tire supplier is Uniroyal-Goodrich, which suppliesabout 34 percent of its tires, according to estimates by the tradepublication Modern Tire Dealer. Goodyear is second at 22.5 percent,Firestone is third with 20 percent, General Tire was fourth at 17.5percent and Michelin was fifth at 4.5 percent, according to thepublication.   Chicago-based Firestone is the nation's second-largest tiremakerafter Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., with tires accounting for nearly70 percent of its $4.2 billion in annual sales.   Firestone said it has told Ford Motor Co. of GM's move and wasauthorized to say in its news release that Ford has no plans tochange its relationship with Firestone, its fourth-largest tiresupplier.   Firestone agreed in March to be acquired by Bridgestone for $80a share after it became the target of an unsolicited offer byItaly's Pirelli SpA.   Firestone had agreed in February to sell 75 percent of itsworldwide tire business to Bridgestone for $1.5 billion, butterminated that venture after Pirelli launched its attempt toacquire the entire company.   In agreeing to acquire Firestone, Bridgestone indicated themerger would help it become a global tiremaker. In addition to itsproduction and marketing capacity, the Japanese company citedFirestone's role as an original equipment supplier _ Bridgestone'sweakest area _ to Ford and GM as a rationale for the acquisition.</TEXT></DOC>
