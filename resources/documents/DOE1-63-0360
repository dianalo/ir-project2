These problemsand possible solutions are discussed in this presentation. The wide variationin size, shape, orientation, and site conditions of forest residues makenecessary new approaches to maximize efficiency and lower costs. Thesetechniques can include whole-tree systems or tree section systems andselective thinning in the harvesting process; in post-harvesting processes,means for aggregation of pieces, such as bundling of branches into bales;comminution in the field; and storage of wood chips so as to minimizeenergy losses. 6 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
