But the Hunts, who officials say came within weeks of corneringthe world's silver market, have neither admitted guilt nor claimedinnocence under terms of the agreement.   The move will help the brothers speed the settlement of theirpersonal bankruptcy cases, filed after they lost a court casestemming from their silver speculation.   In 1985, the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission fileda complaint that sought more than $50 million in fines from theHunts.   ``It could have been a very extensive fight and they wouldn'thave had the money to hire attorneys and continue to litigate aftersettlement of their bankruptcy cases,'' CFTC attorney Linda Grovestold the Dallas Morning News.   Bunker Hunt's bankruptcy neared end last week with U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson's approval of a reorganizationplan. Herbert Hunt's case may end this week.   ``We were happy to get the CFTC decision behind us,'' saidRussell Munsch, Bunker Hunt's lead bankruptcy attorney. ``It is oneof those things that Bunker would have liked to have gone andlitigated.''   Under the agreement, on file in Dallas bankruptcy court, theHunts agreed to pay the $10 million penalty out of future income,gifts and inheritances once they emerge from bankruptcy.   The terms of the CFTC agreement say the Hunts consent tofindings the brothers violated the Commodity Exchange Act bymanipulating the price of silver.   CFTC documents on file in Washington claim that ``by the end ofMay 1980, (the Hunts) could have owned virtually the entireavailable world supply of deliverable .999 silver bullion.''   The effort collapsed on March 27, 1980, the agency said, whenprices fell from about $50 an ounce to about $10 an ounce.   The Hunts lost an estimated $1.3 billion in the collapse andthen a series of lawsuits and claims were initiated against themthat toppled their empire.</TEXT></DOC>
