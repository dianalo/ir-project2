The lawsuit, filed in federal district court here, also asks the court to vindicate the company's recently adopted shareholder rights plan, which was established as an anti-takeover move.    Clark, a truck manufacturer, accused the plaintiffs -- Arthur Goldberg, president of International Controls Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., and other members of the investor group -- of having a &quot;plan or scheme to acquire control of Clark through use of fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative means.&quot;    The suit specifically charges the Goldberg group with trying to extract greenmail from Clark. It also accuses Mr. Goldberg of having a history of practicing &quot;greenmail.&quot; Greenmail occurs when a company buys back an investor's stock at a premium, often under the threat of a takeover.    Also named in the suit were Earle and William Mack, who were identified as New Jersey residents and members of Mr. Goldberg's group.    Earlier this week, Clark said Mr. Goldberg approached the company through First Boston Corp., its investment banker, in an attempt to sell back his 1.2 million shares. Negotiations, however, were unsuccessful.    In an interview, Mr. Goldberg said his offer to sell back the shares was made in reaction to Clark's announcement last week that it planned to buy back as many as three million of its 18.8 million common shares outstanding.    Mr. Goldberg said he rejected Clark's first two proposals to buy back his shares. A third proposal was rejected on &quot;nonmonetary grounds&quot; he said. Both Mr. Goldberg and Clark declined to say how much Clark offered for the shares.    Mentioned in the suit are a litany of transactions that Mr. Goldberg has been involved in, including a proposed leveraged buyout of Great Lakes International Inc. in 1984. The suit charges that Mr. Goldberg threatened that company with the buyout and made $3 million from greenmail as a result.    Mr. Goldberg, however, described the Great Lakes situation as a friendly transaction. &quot;I'm far from a corporate raider,&quot; he said. &quot;Tell me how a little guy like me could pressure a one-and-a-half-billion dollar company like Clark?&quot;    Among other charges, the suit also accuses Mr. Goldberg's group of attempting to further its takeover aims by selectively supplying significant, nonpublic information about a planned tender offer for Clark to &quot;market professionals&quot; not interested in the company's long-term interests. In the suit, Clark also asked the court to order the group to divest itself of its holdings.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Clark closed at $26.75 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
