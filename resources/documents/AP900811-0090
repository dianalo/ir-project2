Erriquez, 24, was kidnapped Oct. 6 in front of an InternationalRed Cross artificial limbs center in Sidon, along with co-workerEmanuel Christen, 33. Christen was freed Wednesday.   Mustafa Saad, head of the Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia thathas governed Sidon since the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war,told reporters in Sidon: ``I believe Erriquez will be releasedsoon.''   He declined to elaborate, or to specify when the release mightbe.   Saad was instrumental in negotiating previous releases ofhostages connected to humanitarian organizations in Sidon, a portcity 25 miles south of Beirut.   The terse statement came four days after a group calling itselfthe Palestinian Revolutionary Squads handed Christen over to Syria.   The group had said in a statement released Tuesday that it wouldfree both Christian and Erriquez within 24 hours. But only Christenwas set free on Wednesday.   The release of Christen, who flew home from the Syrian capitalof Damascus on Thursday, left 15 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon.   In addition to Erriquez, they are six Americans, four Britons,two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.   Most are believed held by extremist factions under the umbrellaof the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God,Iran's main ally in Lebanon.   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Meanwhile, a previously unknown group calling itself the Eaglesof the Tempest threatened to retaliate Saturday for any Westernmilitary action against Iraq.   ``We warn all those who let themselves be seduced into thinkingof a military action against Iraq that they have citizens,interests and hostages in Lebanon,'' said the statement, which wasdelivered to Western news agencies in Beirut.   ``We shall not let the whole world rest as long as our nation isin danger,'' the statement added. ``Our nation'' is believed to bea reference to the Arab people.   The name used by the group suggests it belongs to the SyrianSocial Nationalist Party, a leftist Lebanese group that advocatesthe merger of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, pre-IsraelPalestine and Cyprus into a greater Syria.   The group supports Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion andannexation of Kuwait even though they are pro-Syrian.   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main powerbroker in that country. Syria has strongly condemned the Iraqiinvasion of Kuwait.</TEXT></DOC>
