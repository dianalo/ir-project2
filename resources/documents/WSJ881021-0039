The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest level since last October's collapse for the second time this week by surging 43.92 to 2181.19. The average had lost 22.58 points Wednesday on profit-taking and rumors about the possibility of some unfavorable publicity for Republican presidential candidate George Bush.    &quot;After yesterday's debacle, which was unwarranted, we're back in the up mode that we should have been in all along,&quot; said Bradford G. Weekes, sales trading manager at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.    Among broader market averages, the gains were equally impressive. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 5.91 to 282.88, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.83 to 159.01. Also, advancing issues topped decliners by a 1,058-416 margin on the Big Board.    After a mixed opening, stocks staged a modest rally on news that a management group at RJR Nabisco is considering a leveraged buy-out. The market's initial reaction to the possible offer was short-lived, however, as stocks fell back from their early highs and held there for much of the session.    In the final hour, prices began an upward spiral amid an abrupt surge in activity, which traders attributed in part to buying aimed at offsetting short positions and capitalizing on futures-related arbitrage. Improvement in the bond market and a decline in oil prices also provided a boost for stocks, they said.    The late rush of buying pushed the Dow Jones industrials well beyond the previous post-crash high of 2159.85, set Tuesday, and allowed the average to close with its largest advance since Sept. 2, when the average jumped 52.28 points following the August unemployment report. Big Board volume totaled 189,580,000 shares, up from 186,350,000 Wednesday.    Traders said the market's late spurt may also have been fueled by reports suggesting that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may have trouble reaching agreement on any new production quotas. OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said any accord would have to include all 13 cartel members, but Iran said it wouldn't accept Iraq's demand that the two countries have equal quotas.    Donaldson Lufkin's Bradford G. Weekes noted that much of today's buying could be traced to takeover activity, including the possible buy-out at RJR Nabisco and the $11.4 billion offer for Kraft made by Philip Morris earlier this week.    In both cases, the prices involved are well above the levels at which the stocks were trading before the activity began. &quot;If people are willing to pay the prices they are,&quot; Mr. Weekes said, &quot;it's telling you that stocks are undervalued.&quot;    David Holt, director of technical research at Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy andamp; Gardner, Los Angeles, said the activity shows that the scars created in the market last October are starting to heal among investors.    &quot;The reality is that things are ripe for stocks to go up. There's buying power available, the dollar has stabilized and it looks like the economy is okay,&quot; Mr. Holt said.    As for those who are active on the market's takeover front, &quot;They have already faced the fact that it is the best place to put their money to make it work for them,&quot; he said. &quot;They're committing large sums of money to a program that to them makes sense.&quot;    Ned Davis, head of Ned Davis Research, Venice, Fla., pointed to the takeovers and corporate stock repurchases as major factors behind the market's recent strength, along with recent indications that Mr. Bush is taking a clear lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis. &quot;It's a powerful combination, and it's keeping pressure on the up side,&quot; he said.    On the other hand, Mr. Davis said, short-term interest rates represent an obstacle that the market will have to overcome to advance further. &quot;It makes it hard for the market to run away with short-term rates creeping up the way they are,&quot; he said.    RJR Nabisco soared 21 3/8 to 77 1/4 on news that a management group may offer to acquire the company in a leveraged buy-out at about $75 a share. The suggested price places a value on the company of about $17 billion, which would make the acquisition the most expensive in history. The stock also topped the Big Board's list of most active issues on composite volume of 11.6 million shares. Shearson Lehman Hutton, which has worked for RJR in the past, said it is assisting the group.    The news led to sharp rallies among other tobacco stocks, including Philip Morris, which had been in a slump since making its $11.4 billion offer for Kraft on Tuesday. The stock jumped 5 to 99 on composite volume of 2.8 million shares after plummeting a total of six points during the last two sessions. Elsewhere, American Brands soared 4 3/4 to 59, Loews rose 3 7/8 to 82 3/4 and UST gained 2 3/8 to 37 7/8.    GAF rose 2 to 49 after accepting a sweetened buy-out bid valued at $53 a share from a group headed by its chairman, Samuel Heyman. Terms of the proposal call for payment of $46 a share, along with debentures intended to have a value of $7 a share, up from $5.    CSX, which said it expects to repurchase about 92% of the shares that were tendered under a &quot;Dutch auction&quot; offer, fell 1 3/8 to 30 5/8. The company said it would buy back a total of 43.1 million shares at $32 each.    Caterpillar gained 2 1/2 to 61 1/4 as its third-quarter earnings turned out better than analysts had expected. The company posted net income of $1.87 a share for the quarter, up from $1.47 a year earlier. Monsanto dropped 5/8 to 80; its third-quarter net of $1.67 a share was on the low end of expectations.    Salomon added 1 to 27. The departure of E. Craig Coats Jr., the firm's top government bond trader, and its filing to offer $2 billion in debt Wednesday led to rumors that a buy-out might be in the works. Salomon denied the speculation.    Texas Eastern climbed 2 to 29 3/8 amid rumors that someone would disclose ownership of more than 5% of its common shares and that the company may be considering a restructuring. The company declined comment on the rumors.    The American Stock Exchange index gained 1.89 to 306.37. Volume totaled 8,990,000 shares, down from 9,510,000 Wednesday. There were 298 issues advancing and 258 declining.    Champion Products rose 1 7/8 to 41 1/4. The company, which reported strong third-quarter earnings Wednesday of $1.70 a share, up from 85 cents a year earlier, declared its regular quarterly dividend of 12 cents a share, to be paid in November.    Energy Development Partners plunged 5/8 to 3 3/8. The partnership suspended payment of cash distributions because of lower third-quarter oil and natural gas prices and uncertainty over prices in the fourth quarter. The partnership had been paying 27 1/2 cents per depositary unit.    Western Digital rose 3/4 to 12 1/2 after reporting earnings for its first quarter ended Oct. 1 of 45 cents a share, compared with operating earnings of 42 cents last year. The company's revenue jumped to $247 million for the quarter, up from $140.1 million a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
