During the year, foreign holdings in the U.S. grew nearlytwice as much as U.S. holdings abroad, the CommerceDepartment said. As a result, the U.S. was left shouldering anet debt burden -- the difference between U.S. holdingsabroad and foreigners' holdings here -- of $663.75 billion.That was nearly 25% higher than the nation's $531.08 billionnet debt position in 1988.</LP><TEXT>   The report was the latest chapter in America's stunningdecline from the world's largest creditor nation in 1983 tothe world's largest debtor nation.   A continued surge in foreign investment in everything fromNew York office towers to Treasury securities to entire U.S.companies, hoisted foreigners' assets in the U.S. to $2.076trillion last year from $1.797 trillion in 1988. That swampedthe growth in U.S. investment abroad, which lifted U.S.foreign assets to $1.413 trillion from $1.266 trillion in1988.   Not only was the report grim news for the U.S. government,but it also brought some embarrassing chiding of the CommerceDepartment. For the first time, the department decided not topublish the bottom-line debtor position of the U.S. -- the$663.75 billion figure -- in its report on internationalinvestment, although it provided enough information tocalculate the number.   In a statement accompanying the report, the departmentexplained that the comparison of the values of foreign assetsin the U.S. and U.S. assets abroad was imprecise since itmixed current prices of assets with prices paid when theywere purchased. The result, according to the department, wasthat U.S. assets, many of which were purchased decades ago,were generally undervalued compared with foreign assets, thebulk of which were purchased in the 1980s.   But critics accused the government of trying to paper overa dreadful number. &quot;Any decision not to print a bottom line,I think, is masking a net position and a trend that isindisputably very adverse,&quot; said C. Fred Bergsten, directorof the Institute for International Economics here.   Mr. Bergsten, who is writing a book on America's debtorstatus, did agree that &quot;there are big problems with thenumbers.&quot; But he said the numbers may understate U.S.liabilities as well as assets. &quot;My conclusion is that the netbottom line is not too inaccurate, and certainly the trend ofthe last 10 years is indisputable,&quot; he said.   Allan Young, head of the Commerce Department's Bureau ofEconomic Analysis, which compiled the report, said thedepartment's decision not to print the number was part of agovernment-wide effort to improve the quality of economicstatistics. &quot;No other considerations entered into it,&quot; Mr.Young said. &quot;It's simply that we didn't think it was anaccurate number.&quot; By this time next year, he said, thedepartment aims to publish a report valuing all internationalinvestment at current prices.</TEXT></DOC>
