In myexperience, as a New York City TreePerson, there is nothingsimple about the act of planting a tree on these streets,much less planting a phalanx of flowers around it. Both actscan be fraught with danger. Many New Yorkers are TreeHaters,people who get their kicks knocking wood, beating up on oaksand maples, torching ginkgos, skinning Callery pears,karate-chopping Kwanzan cherries, dismembering London planeslimb from limb. Simple TreeTerrorist acts such as these havebeen visited on most of the trees in my neighborhood, mycity, and my world. I know, because I tend a few of the111,000 trees that grow in Brooklyn: the 11 on my side of theblock.   On a recent, torrid 80-something day this nano-spring, Iheaded for the street with my favorite spade and a bag oforphan daylilies, to observe the Citizen Street Tree Pruner'sobligatory rite of spring: cleaning the tree pits of awinter's city mulch -- colorfully stoppered crack vials, dogdroppings, beer and whiskey bottles, hypodermic needles andthose little spruce-tree-shaped &quot;CAR FRESHNERS&quot; that cityfolk use for street fresh'ners.</LP><TEXT>   I began gardening beneath my block's legendary tree, aCallery pear that five years ago miraculously survived asavage skin peel by a pre-teen boy. For days, my neighborEdgar Clarke had watched his tree weep the length of its rawtrunk. His tree stands one brownstone down from the block'scrack house. This recession-proof establishment is the sourceof our crackvial compost.   Our resident drug impresarios pretend to invisibility. Butwe see them. And as I was spading the soil and planting thedaylilies, Dealer No. 2 came down the stoop. I glued my eyeson him. Such blatant proof of his uninvisibility, suchdissing, angered the young entrepreneur. He stalked over,grabbed my spade and threatened to cut me up.   Before he could, Mr. Clarke, guardian of the pear tree,timely interposed himself and wrested back my digging tool.(The spade blade is 4 1/2 inches wide, heart-shaped,pointed.) Next, my neighbor prevailed on me to stop workingthe street tree pits. Somewhat shaken, I retreated into thehouse and called the police to report being menaced by aweapon-wielding drug dealer. &quot;What weapon?&quot; the cop asked.&quot;My gardening spade.&quot; Mention a gun and the police show up inminutes. Mention a gardening spade and they take two hours.   This first street-gardening incident of 1991 on my blockillustrates yet another peculiarity of city gardening in atime of crack. Crack keeps redefining the perilous newfrontier for urban green thumbs, but has yet to be takenseriously by city gardening experts. Even Linda Yang, in herexcellent and encyclopedic &quot;City Gardener's Handbook&quot; (RandomHouse, 1990), mentions nothing more felonious than plantlarceny and &quot;front-garden vandalism&quot; of &quot;exceptionallyvulnerable&quot; street plantings. Ms. Yang proposes &quot;offensivegardening&quot; (street deployment of &quot;plants with offensivethorns&quot;) but does not deal with the danger posed by a drugdealer's quick recognition of the weapons potential in thecity gardener's favorite tools.   I decided I had a duty to air this problem, by taking myspade to Brooklyn Criminal Court to show to the D.A. Uponentering, I was frisked and my backpack X-rayed. The guardwas not fooled by my garden tool and ordered: &quot;Check yourweapon at the door.&quot; On my way out, my weapon was notreturned to me until an armed escort handed it over at thestreet door.   Since then, I have tried to escape into the calm,four-color perfections of the spring catalogs. Alas, thesimple fact of being menaced with my own spade has warped mycatalog reading. For ironically, when read from a weaponspoint of view, the gardening catalogs are way ahead of thestreet criminals in exploiting the weapons angle of the toolsthey sell. Take the Smith andamp; Hawken Pick and Hoe, with 13/4-inch &quot;chopping blade . . . beveled to perfect sharpness .. . will cut, slice, pry and pierce with tenacity.&quot; Or theSandamp;H General Brush Hook, good for &quot;pruning, cutting,slashing.&quot; The Sandamp;H Long Reach Flower Gatherer with&quot;surgically sharp Teflon-coated blade and serrated jaws.&quot; TheJapanese Hand Sickles are &quot;razorsharp tools&quot; that &quot;cut withastonishing ease.&quot; The Japanese Hatchet &quot;resembles a cleaver. . . Great for chopping, kindling, limbing, trimming.&quot; Icannot leave out the Crocodile Machete.   I wonder if the NRA -- should the Brady Bill pass -- mightwant to take up the cause of garden weapons to ensure theyremain as easy to purchase as they are now. After all, Smithandamp; Hawken's Multi-Pattern Spray Gun has &quot;a comfortable triggergrip&quot; and its Safer SharpShooter Herbicide is &quot;ready foraction.&quot; Even Pinetree Garden Seeds in Maine offers a &quot;6 in 1Pistol Kit&quot; and a &quot;1 Quart Trigger Spray.&quot; Do hose nozzleshave to sound like the guns next door? I leaf through &quot;TheComplete Illustrated Guide to Everything Sold in GardenCenters (except the plants)&quot; by Steve Ettlinger (Macmillan,1990) to check out the gunnery imagery. Mr. Ettlinger givesthe low-down on the &quot;Pistol-grip nozzle (also known as spraygun nozzle) . . . excellent . . . where quick on-and-offaction is needed&quot; and mentions &quot;a modified version, called atrigger nozzle&quot; that &quot;looks like a gun and is verycomfortable to use.&quot; Most of the catalogs carry Trigger Griptrowels.   I keep a sharp hair-trigger grip on my trowel finger as Iread beyond guns to swords and spears. Walt Nicke's GardenTalk catalog carries a full complement of Spear and JacksonEnglish Digging Tools and the Kinsman Company offers avariety of Wilkinson Sword Cutting Tools: Sword Pruners with&quot;precision ground chromed steel blades,&quot; the Adjustable SuperShear, Notched Shear and Large Lopper.   Some of the &quot;innovative gardening solutions&quot; to be hadfrom Gardener's Supply Company, in Vermont, sound prettyscary, too. Take the Folding Pruning Saw. &quot;Patented bladedesign. Each tooth is precision-ground and then sharpened onboth sides. This gives the teeth a `bite' that cuts quicklyand accurately.&quot; I think my arsenal could use the Weed Slicer(Walt Nicke), &quot;very effective in tight spots.&quot;   Just when I had about decided to arm myself with a SaferSharpShooter and leave it at that, what should arrive in themail but the Fiskars Series 9000 By-Pass Pruner with a noteaddressed to me, &quot;Dear Garden Enthusiaist,&quot; {sic} offering methe chance to celebrate National Garden Month with &quot;thesharpest pruner you have ever used.&quot; A pedigreed prunerdescendant of other Wausau, Wis., Fiskars: the&quot;wishbone-style Hedge Shears and the classic By-Pass Lopper.&quot;What's more, &quot;The progressive lever mechanics coupled withadvanced blade edge geometry . . . mean a staggering 20%increase in cutting efficiency&quot; and &quot;a clean cut&quot; thanks to&quot;ergonomic handles.&quot; All I can say is forget about the&quot;ambidextrous safety catch&quot; once this Series 9000 By-PassPruner hits the street. In fact, this weapon is so good Iworry that ergonomically aware crack dealers will get theirown. But for the moment, we gardeners have a monopoly on theSeries 9000.   No doubt about it, gardening is one great cover. You canorder these Saturday afternoon specials: pistols, machetes,swords and spears through the mail, no questions asked. Butshould we? Perhaps we city gardeners are reaching an angerpoint. Do we withdraw from the streets? Or stay defending ourtree pits and curbside gardens? I figure the waystreet-gardening crack battles are going, either I upgrade myweapons technology, modernize my stockpile and escalate tohigher shearing, lopping, cutting, slicing, pistol power, orI disarm. I choose to disarm, but where, in 1991, do you buya dull tool?</TEXT></DOC>
