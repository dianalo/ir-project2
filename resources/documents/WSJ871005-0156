The athletic-shoe maker has 72% of its shoes made in South Korea, where recent labor and political strife has hurt production. As previously reported, Reebok said third-quarter earnings rose only slightly from the prior year's $45.1 million, or 42 cents a share, because of shoe shortages.    Reebok said Mr. Barclay, 46 years old, will work on developing other shoe sources for expected increasing demand. It said that South Korea will continue to provide as many shoes as it has in the past, but that the percentage will decline.    Paul Fireman, the 43-year-old chairman of Reebok, will be responsible for the footwear division -- Reebok's largest division until a new president is found. </TEXT></DOC>
