But Denmark is gradually moving toward the fore of some foreign-exchange and bond-market investors' interest.    &quot;For people in the know of international financial markets, the Danish krone is hot,&quot; says Lawrence L. Kreicher, vice president and international economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. In late New York trading Friday, the Danish currency was quoted at 6.45 krone to the dollar.    Fueling the krone's fire are improved Danish economic factors and high local interest rates. It's also aided by bearish sentiment toward the dollar, compared with all currencies in the European Monetary System, the eight-currency exchange rate mechanism anchored by the West German mark.    The main risk seen with krone-denominated investments is the possibility of a devaluation of the currency in a realignment within the EMS. But economists say it's most likely that only a renewed dollar decline would create the strains with the EMS to prompt a realignment. So American investors would be left with prior gains in addition to higher yields.    &quot;You're looking at a currency that's probably going to rise above the dollar and has yield spreads about 200 basis points above the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Kreicher says. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.    Mr. Kreicher notes that yields on five-year Danish government securities were quoted at 9.81% last week, in contrast to 7.70% on similar U.S. instruments.    Danish interest rates are also among the highest in the EMS. In particular, they stand out against yields in West Germany, home of the traditional alternatives to dollar investments. Three-month Eurodeposits in kroner yield 8.75%, in contrast to 3.25% for a like investment denominated in marks.    The mark has slid 1% to 3.818 kroner Friday, from 3.856 at the end of last year. &quot;It seems like an insignificant move considering what the dollar does every day, but within the EMS, that's a significant move,&quot; says Michael D. Andrews, vice president and foreign exchange economist at Irving Trust Co., New York. When overall exchange rates are looked at, Mr. Andrews says, the krone this year has surpassed the French franc as the third strongest EMS currency behind the mark and the Dutch guilder.    Improving economic and political factors distinguish the krone from many other high-yield currencies that are considered riskier bets, analysts say. Economists expect government figures to show that the Danish current account deficit was slashed by more than half last year, to 17 billion kroner, from 34.5 billion kroner in 1986. Similarly progress was made by the coalition government of Premier Poul Schluter in cutting Denmark's budget defict. Economists estimate the budget narrowed to 10.5 billion kroner or 1.5% as a percent of gross domestic product in 1987, from 22.2 billion kroner or 3.3% of the nation's total economic output.    Part of the krone's rise against the mark was spurred by the dollar's rally this year. In the surge of dollar buying in early January, the mark was disproportionately sold off in relation to other European currencies because so-called hot investor money tends to flow deepest between West Germany and the U.S.    Conversely, the mark would be the primary beneficiary of a renewed sell-off of the dollar. Although many economists predict the dollar will fall to new lows this year against the mark, some maintain that the higher Danish yields will offset any gap in its appreciation against the dollar compared with the mark's rise. &quot;For a dollar investor, maybe there's a little more currency risk (in the krone) than the mark, but you're getting a higher yield. That's the trade-off, and it's a reasonable one,&quot; says Stephen Leach, a currency analyst at Chemical Bank, New York.    In New York Friday, the dollar drifted lower against most major currencies in the wake of Thursday's Commerce Department report showing slower U.S. economic growth than many market participants expected.    Traders said that report of revised fourth-quarter growth estimates continued to weigh the dollar down Friday.    In late New York dealings the dollar stood at 1.6895 West German marks, down from 1.6925 Thursday. The dollar also slipped to 128.35 yen, from 128.45, while the British pound climbed to $1.7720, from $1.7672.    In trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar opened at 128.08 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery fell $3.60 an ounce to $429.60 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $429.40 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, Feb. 26, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
