GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Burma said Tuesday it has released 51people who were detained during bloody anti-government protestslast week that led to the resignation of President Sein Lwin.   The release came as student groups in the capital of Rangoondistributed leaflets calling for more protests Wednesday againstBurma's one-party government, diplomats and journalists said.   The official radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the 51 prisonersreleased from Insein prison on the outskirts of Rangoon included 37male students, 10 female students and four civilians.   It also said 30 people arrested earlier this month indisturbances in Pegu, 45 miles northeast of the capital, were freedon Sunday.   The releases were the first since violent nationwidedemonstrations ended Friday with the resignation of Sein Lwin, ahardline former general.   Radio Rangoon said a week ago that authorities had arrested morethan 700 demonstrators. Later, it reported 1,451 arrests in Rangoonbut did not make clear if that included the 700 mentioned earlier.   The protests were the most massive since Burma achievedindependence from Britain in 1948.   In a sweep last month following Sein Lwin's elevation to the toppost, authorities arrested the country's most prominent dissident,Aung Gyi, as well as Associated Press correspondent Sein Win. Therewas no indication that they were among those who were freed.   Life in Rangoon continued its slow return to normal Tuesday.Soldiers maintained their guard on police stations for fear ofattacks similar to those in which three policemen were beheaded byprotesters last week.   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said trucks and tanks with up to200 soldiers were parked on Merchant Street in the center of thecity, about 200 yards from the U.S. Embassy.   The show of force ``appeared to be a precaution because posterscalled for continued protests,'' said the diplomat, speaking oncondition of anonymity. He said the vehicles were gone by Tuesday,and there was only a light troop presence in the rest of thecapital.   The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party and the country'slegislature have scheduled emergency sessions for Friday,presumably to choose a successor to Sein Lwin, who served only 17days and was hated for brutally crushing dissent.   Sein Lwin took over when Ne Win resigned abruptly as leaderafter 26 years of authoritarian rule.   Most analysts believe the country's next ruler will be an activeor retired military officer from the enduring hierarchy of Ne Win,whose coming to power in a 1962 military coup ended Burma'sexperiment with democracy.   Diplomats and tourists arriving in Bangkok from Burma on Tuesdaysaid among the seven demands listed by protesters in leaflets andposters were a multiparty democracy, the release of politicaldissidents including Aung Gyi, a court trial of Sein Lwin, and thelegalization of student unions.   Students also have called for major changes in leadership,reductions in the cost of living and compensation for families ofpeople killed or wounded in last week's demonstrations.   In a sign of discontent within the system, 177 Burmese lawyerssigned a document charging that by firing against peacefuldemonstrators, including children, security forces violated theBurmese constitution and the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.   Japan's Kyodo and China's Xinhua news agencies reported fromRangoon that the Lawyer's Council, an organization under thegovernment's Council of People's Attorneys, submitted its protestto the Council of State, or president's office.   Radio Rangoon has said at least 95 people were killed and 240wounded in protests in two dozen towns last week, but Westerndiplomats believe the toll was much higher.   No major rallies have been reported since Sein Lwin resigned.But a senior Western diplomat said the recent leaflet and postercampaign indicated massive street protests would resume unlessauthorities meet demands for leadership changes and multipartydemocracy.   Another Rangoon-based diplomat said that while some studentswould be satisfied with nothing less than dismantling one-partyrule, ``rank-and-file'' protesters might stay off the streets ifauthorities make gradual concessions.</TEXT></DOC>
