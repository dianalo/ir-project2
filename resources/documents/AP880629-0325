All but 100 of the jobs to be cut are in the Pittsburgh area,where 4,000 of the 7,000 energy systems jobs are located. Most ofthe cuts will be made by year's end.   ``Worldwide competition is the major force affecting ourbusinesses,'' said Richard J. Slember, vice president and generalmanager of the segment. ``The business has changed from supplyinglarge commercial nuclear plants to supplying smaller fossil-fueledplants, waste-to-energy plants, and engineering and fieldservices.''   Slember said a growing number of small competitors with loweroverhead costs are ``making it necessary for us to streamline ourorganization to compete successfully and grow in these markets.''</TEXT></DOC>
