Meanwhile, 5,000 miles away in Paris, French officials will still be trying to answer a question that has been up in the air a lot longer: Why?    Nine years and four governments after the satellite was conceived, officials are realizing the exercise may be a costly boondoggle with little technological benefit and even less commercial promise.    &quot;This satellite is ready to go off into space having cost France three billion francs {nearly $500 million}, and nothing is ready to be beamed on it,&quot; fumed Prime Minister Michel Rocard last summer.    But like his predecessors, Mr. Rocard found it impossible to stop a project on which France has staked a lot of pride. A few days later, he gave the go-ahead to launch the satellite -- provided that programs can quickly be found to be beamed on it and affordable reception equipment made available to viewers. Both conditions could require even more government subsidies.    As with the expensive Rafale fighter plane France is developing -- though not even the French navy, let alone foreign customers, appear to want it -- the story of the TDF1 satellite shows how national prestige can override commercial logic in France. Gerard Longuet, a member of parliament who was communications minister under former Premier Jacques Chirac, says three French governments, including Chirac's, erred in backing TDF1, which he describes as &quot;the best way to throw our money out the window.&quot;    Not everyone agrees. Its supporters, the engineers who built it and the electronics industry that stands to gain from it, say the satellite will improve the quality of television pictures. They say it is an essential step toward high-definition television, or HDTV, which will combine movielike pictures with compact-disc-quality sound. France's failure to launch the satellite, its proponents argue, would be a blow to Europe's hopes of competing with Japan in developing HDTV standards.    But to its critics, TDF1 is another Concorde -- a technology-driven, government-supported prestige project that hasn't any market. Just days before launch, only one broadcaster, the state-financed French cultural channel La Sept, had signed up to use the satellite. It is unclear how many people will be willing to pay the nearly $1,000 that the reception equipment will cost. Many engineers are skeptical the satellite will work or that it has anything to do with HDTV. And financial experts say the satellite can't make money.    &quot;If this weren't part of the battle for HDTV, we'd stop everything,&quot; says a senior government official. &quot;This has been a rotten dossier from the start.&quot;    TDF1 was born in 1979 as a lofty-sounding project: France and West Germany were to jointly develop two similar direct-broadcast satellites that would permit the creation of Pan-European, multilingual TV stations with a potential audience of 350 million. But since then, the picture has changed: Satellite technology has evolved, satellite competition has intensified, and the European television scene has been transformed by deregulation.    On top of that, the Ariane rocket was grounded for 18 months, and the satellite itself was beset by technical problems. TDF1's twin sister, West Germany's TV Sat1, was launched earlier this year, but one of its solar panels refused to open and it drifts aimlessly in space.    And so TDF1 comes onto the market &quot;like an already elderly baby,&quot; in the words of Jacques Baumel, a conservative member of parliament.    When Paris and Bonn began working on the project, powerful satellites were the rage, so they designed satellites with four to five channels of 230 watts each. But receiving-dish sensitivity has improved dramatically. Where 200 watts were necessary then, 50 watts suffice now; and instead of unwieldy dishes, antennas with a diameter of 16 to 32 inches will do.    &quot;Every herring in the North Sea from Iceland to the Soviet Union will be able to watch TV,&quot; quips Laurent Blin, a former adviser to Mr. Longuet.    This lesson wasn't lost on more recent satellite ventures like Astra, TDF1's main rival, which is to be launched in November. Developed by a private company, Societe Europeenne des Satellites, backed by the Luxembourg government, Astra will offer 16 channels of 45 watts each to TDF1's five.    As a result, Astra can lease each channel for about 40 million francs ($6.5 million) a year, one-third the price TDF1 must charge to break even. And Astra's reception equipment costs much less. TDF1 is being forced to align its costs on Astra's, with the losses covered by subsidies.    Though he won't criticize TDF1 directly, Astra commercial director Marcus Bicknell says &quot;national pride and technological mumbo jumbo&quot; didn't play a part in Astra's conception.    Astra's appearance underscores another big change in Europe: the explosion of television channels. When TDF1 was conceived, it seemed a good way to get around Europe's state broadcasting monopolies. Since then, TV has been deregulated in countries such as France and Italy, and private networks created. Cable TV has made its appearance and satellites such as Eutelsat and Intelsat have been launched.    Yet while TDF1 opponents call the satellite obsolete, supporters portray it as the key to the future. It will introduce a new standard called D2 Mac, which provides for enhanced picture and sound as well as several sound channels. D2 Mac will allow one program to be beamed simultaneously in several languages. And advocates claim that while D2 Mac isn't itself part of Europe's proposed high-definition television standard, it is an important step in the direction of HDTV.    Critics scoff at that contention as a ploy by an alliance of technocrats and manufacturers to sell the satellite to the public. Jacques Rigaud, chairman of Radio-Television Luxembourg, suggests that France launch TDF1 on an experimental basis, that France and West Germany seek jointly to launch TV Sat2, the backup West German satellite, and that TDF2, the French backup, &quot;be sent to the Museum of Science and Technology.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
