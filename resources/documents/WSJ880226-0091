The plan opens undergraduate programs at 55 colleges and universities in 10 Western states to students from that region at costs not much higher than those paid by in-state students.    Nonresident students at state schools usually pay two to four times the tuition charged local students. But this fall, students from the 10 states in the Western Undergraduate Exchange will qualify for a relative bargain: resident tuition plus 50%.    For example, a freshman from Utah entering the University of Northern Colorado, in Greeley, would pay $2,354 a year in tuition and fees -- 50% more than the $1,569 tuition charged Colorado students but barely half the regular nonresident tuition of $4,050.    The program applies to most, but not all, two-year and four-year public colleges in Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Conspicuously absent from the network are Arizona, California, Oregon and Washington, where campuses are already crowded and cut-rate tuition could cause a glut of out-of-state students.    The undergraduate exchange is run by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education in Boulder, Colo., which already administers similar exchange programs on the graduate level.    Colorado Fuel Tax   Drives Away Truckers   OPERATORS of truck stops in Colorado say it's no secret why their diesel fuel sales have plunged in the past 18 months. It's the same reason a lot of long-haul truckers are driving across Wyoming and New Mexico instead of Colorado on transcontinental trips.    In July 1986, Colorado raised its diesel fuel tax 57% to 20.5 cents a gallon, the highest in the U.S. The move was a success as a money raiser. Diesel fuel tax collections soared $10 million in the 12 months after the tax increase to $36.5 million.    But as tax revenue went up, diesel fuel sales for the 12 months fell 11% in volume, to 182 million gallons. Highway miles reported at truck weigh stations have dropped -- added evidence that truckers are avoiding Colorado.    &quot;Colorado's known in the industry as a 'no-buy state,'&quot; says Henry Stukey, general manager of Truck Denver, a big truck stop. His fuel sales are off 20% from normal volume.    Johnson's Corner truck stop, in Loveland, Colo., is 40 miles from Wyoming, where the diesel tax is eight cents a gallon, the nation's lowest. A lot of rigs that used to fill up at Johnson's Corner now wait until they hit Wyoming to refuel. Gary Floyd, owner of Johnson's Corner, says he pumped one million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in 1987 than a year earlier. In addition to lost fuel sales, Mr. Floyd figures that for each truck that doesn't stop, he's out $28 -- what the average driver spends on food and other non-fuel items.    Trucking industry leaders will plead their case Monday to Gov. Roy Romer, who inherited the high tax from his predecessor. &quot;The governor keeps saying Colorado is 'open for business,'&quot; Mr. Floyd says. &quot;How can you be open for business if you've closed the door to trucking?&quot;    Calculating Lost Income   From AIDS in Nevada   WITH A NOD to the human tragedy associated with AIDS, two University of Nevada, Las Vegas, professors have gone on to calculate the likely lost personal income stemming from state residents diagnosed with AIDS and AIDS-related diseases.    The study is based on 65 AIDS cases, virtually the entire AIDS caseload reported to Nevada health officials from 1982 to 1986. Although medical information is largely confidential, Profs. Clarence Ray and Vicky Carwein learned the age and occupation of each AIDS patient, then figured the wages and salaries that each person would earn had he or she remained in Nevada until retirement. Fewer than 10 of the 65 people are still alive.    The study estimated current and future income, adjusted for inflation, at $84.8 million. Much of that total would have returned to the Nevada economy as savings, taxes and consumer spending.    The numbers become numbing when one looks ahead. Nevada's AIDS caseload is small compared with most states, but the rate of infection there is surging. Eighty-seven new AIDS cases were diagnosed last year, more than a threefold increase from 1986.    The Clark County Health District, which includes Las Vegas, estimates the number of people in Nevada infected with the AIDS virus at 9,500, about 1% of the state population. Recent evidence indicates that about one-third of all people carrying the AIDS virus develop a fatal AIDS-related disease within seven years.    New Titles   THE DENVER-BASED Western States' Strategy Center has just published &quot;Profile of the West,&quot; a $19.95 handbook with some 300 pages of population, economic and social statistics on the Far West, Rocky Mountain and Northern Plains states. The center is a new regional research group created to serve as a counterpoint to such existing regional think tanks as the Northeast-Midwest Institute, the Southern Growth Policies Board, and the Sunbelt Institute.    Devising new ways to pay for sewers, roads and other public works projects is local government's No. 1 headache. The National League of Cities in Washington has just published 24 case histories explaining how Cincinnati; Napa, Calif.; Prince George's County, Md.; and others tackled the job. The 140-page handbook, &quot;Financing Infrastructure,&quot; costs $15. </TEXT></DOC>
