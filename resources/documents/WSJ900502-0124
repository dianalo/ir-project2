Andre subsequently told police that hismildly inebriated wife, a Cuban-American, was depressed aboutnot being as moderately famous as he, and leapt. The policedid not bite. Circumstantial evidence was sufficiently strongto indict Andre for second-degree murder, but notsufficiently strong to put him in the slammer, where peoplewho have spent their adult lives arranging hundreds of bricksor bales of hay in fascinating patterns on museum floors donot win friends as easily as in lower Manhattan.   To this day, no one knows what happened up on the 34thfloor in the moments before Mendieta's death, but this hasnot prevented Robert Katz from writing a 456-page book aboutit. In fairness to Mr. Katz, &quot;Naked by the Window&quot; (AtlanticMonthly Press, $19.95) must have been a tough assignment.With Mendieta dead and Andre unwilling to be interviewed, Mr.Katz had to reconstruct the story by talking to 200 friendsor relatives of the artists. He didn't get much out of them.</LP><TEXT>   By the end of the book, Mr. Katz cannot conceal hischagrin at the art world's circle-the-wagons mentality, atthe reluctance of New York's artistic community to bare itssoul to an outsider. Since a typical Katz sentence reads, &quot;Hebelieved in the culture of art as a cathedral in which onemight find communion with the essence of one's times,&quot; theartists probably were smart to clam up.   The author has arranged the story in such a way that thereader starts off assuming that Andre is guilty of his wife'smurder -- because of the artist's oddly phrased 9-1-1 callreporting his wife's fall, because of a suspicious scratch onhis nose, because Mendieta was afraid of heights, andbecause, at 4 foot 10 inches tall, the rising 36-year-oldartist was too short to have accidentally fallen out of thewindow, not with 73% of her body below the sill.   But despite Mr. Katz's potboiling efforts to make theverdict seem in doubt, it becomes apparent that Andre couldnever be convicted on evidence as inconclusive as this,particularly not when there were so many people willing toattest to his worth as an artist and as a human being, and tolend him big bucks to hire a hotshot lawyer (there was no waythe court was going to accept 183 bales of hay as bondcollateral, no matter how ingeniously they were arranged).   This is not Mr. Katz's only problem. Although Andre is anartist very familiar to a knowing but tiny elite, he is notAndy Warhol (or even Jasper Johns). That's largely why thescandal, after an initial flurry, attracted so littleinterest. Andre was a star, but not of the first magnitude,and Mendieta was not a star at all.   To make matters worse, the trial was completelyovershadowed by two other New York scandals: RobertChambers's strangling of fellow preppy Jennifer Levin inCentral Park, and art dealer Andrew Crispo's alleged crossingof the line from Saturday-night sadomasochism to thefullblown torture of one man and the death of another.   Mr. Katz intermittently throws out the suggestion thatMendieta's Hispanic origins may have had something to do withthis lack of press interest, but in truth the exiled daughterof anti-Castro Cubans, the girl who had grown up in an Iowaorphanage, never truly belonged to the Hispanic communitynorth of 96th Street; she was a denizen of the artsy-craftsybarrio south of 14th. The ethnic angle does not ring true.   The feminist angle does -- or should. Had Mendieta notbeen a short, obscure female artist, Mr. Katz seems to argue,and had Andre not been an established male fixture on the artscene, more of a stink might have been raised by hisacquittal. But even here Mr. Katz ran into problems, for, tohis amazement, plenty of women were ready to go to bat forAndre, and the feminist community never really got its danderup.   The book purports to be a voyage inside the SoHo artburb,but it falls short here as well. As Tom Wolfe demonstrated togreat comic effect but little practical result in &quot;ThePainted Word,&quot; modern artists are sitting ducks for satire.That's because this is a society that condemns painters whoearn millions from their worthless pieces of paper, butidolizes leveraged buyout specialists who earn billions fromtheir worthless pieces of paper. If you're a halfway decentwriter -- which Mr. Katz is -- and you want to make20th-century artists look stupid, you won't have much troubledoing it, but to the credit of contemporary artists most ofthem don't seem to care.   So Mr. Katz's backhanded slaps at SoHo bohos don't workany better than the rest of his story. Shifting back andforth between hardboiled true-detective patter and windypseudo-psychologizing, Mr. Katz acts as if hundreds of pagesof mildly interesting biographical details will make &quot;Nakedby the Window&quot; into a big book. It isn't big; it's justlarge. But there is a good book to be written on thissubject, and here's hoping some woman writes it.   ---   Mr. Queenan is a free-lance writer living in Tarrytown,N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
