Rowan, callinghimself a pawn in a larger gun-control debate, pleaded innocentMonday to charges he used an unregistered weapon to shoot ateen-ager who took an uninvited dip in his backyard pool.   Rowan has been charged with one count each of possessing anunregistered weapon, and possessing ammunition for the gun, inconnection with the June 14 shooting. Both are misdemeanors.   District of Columbia Superior Court Hearing Commissioner KayeChristian scheduled trial for Sept. 22, and released Rowan on hisown recognizance. Rowan requested a jury trial.   If he is convicted on both charges, the columnist could face amaximum penalty of two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.   The district's 1976 handgun ordinance essentially bans posessionof handguns and ammunition not owned at the time the law waspassed, except for law officers.   After his court appearance, Rowan lashed out at those who say heis hypocritical for using a handgun.   ``I am aware that I am the pawn in a brutal game between thosewho favor and those who oppose handgun control,'' Rowan said,reading a prepared statement to dozens of reporters and televisioncamera crews. ``I want to make it clear that I still favor a strictnational law to control the availability of handguns.   ``There is no hypocrisy in advocating a national policy that noone seems to be able to get through Congress,'' he said.   The columnist also asserted that he has received additionaldeath threats since the shooting incident. He had previously toldpolice that he obtained the weapon used in the shooting afterreceiving similar threats in 1982.   Rowan has said that the gun and ammunition were originally ownedby his son, Carl Jr., who was told that he did not need to registerthem because he was serving as an FBI agent at the time.   Outside the courthouse, a half-dozen handgun advocates ralliedin support of the columnist's right to bear arms.   ``We think that Carl Rowan may be guilty of raving hypocrisy,but he shouldn't be charged in a court of law today for protectinghis home with a gun,'' said Lee Bellinger, the leader of Action forAmerica, a conservative activist group that champions the right toprivate handgun ownership. ``We welcome him into the family ofpeople protecting their home with guns.''   Other supporters carried posters reading, ``Warning: This homeprotected by Carl Rowan,'' coupled with a Rambo-like drawing ofRowan's head atop a muscle-bound, gun-toting torso. Still othersdisplayed signs reading, ``Leave Carl Rowan alone.''   ``It (the Rowan shooting) shows what can happen in a moment ofpanic,'' said Sarah Brady, wife of James Brady, President Reagan'spress secretary.   She was not at the rally, but said in a telephone interview,``With the handgun, in most cases you see more cases of misuse thanyou do anything else.''   Brady became president of Handgun Control, an anti-handgungroup, after her husband suffered permanent brain damage when hewas wounded during John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt to assassinateReagan in 1981.   Rowan, 62, was cleared last month of assault charges in theshooting incident after an investigation by federal prosecutors.U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said at the time that he thought Rowanshould be prosecuted on the weapons charges, but deferred thatdecision to District of Columbia officials, who normally decidewhether to prosecute such cases.   The shooting occurred, Rowan said, when he heard noises in hisbackyard, called police, and discovered Benjamin Smith, 18, ofsuburban Chevy Chase, Md., and three other youths by his pool.Rowan shot Smith in the wrist when, he said, the youth lunged athim.   Smith and a companion Laura Bachman, 19, were charged withunlawful entry, but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charges inexchange for 40 hours of community service work.</TEXT></DOC>
