Buchanan isan annoying distraction. But to the small group ofjournalists and activists who met here this past weekend, theBuchanan campaign is an opportunity to take back control ofthe American right.   The group is the John Randolph Club, named after an early19th-century Virginian congressman, who ferociously opposedcentralized government before going insane. Its firstmeeting, held one year ago, brought together two strains ofconservatism that had long been at odds but that foundthemselves united in bitter opposition to the war in thePersian Gulf: traditionalist conservatives, who putpreserving a pre-modern social order ahead of the freemarket, and hard-core libertarians, who abhor all exercisesof authority by the state.</LP><TEXT>   The sleek Reaganite conservatism of the 1980s and 1990shas had little time for these people, but they are thefriends, admirers and mentors of Pat Buchanan. One of themdescribed the Herndon meeting as &quot;the estates-general of theBuchanan campaign.&quot; And indeed, it was a glimpse into theworld from which Mr. Buchanan's ideas spring. Mr. Buchananhas been praising the John Randolph Club in print, agreeingwith it in a May column that &quot;Before true conservatives canever take back the country, they are first going to have totake back their movement.&quot;   The weekend was supposed to have begun with an address byMr. Buchanan, but he had to cancel and so was replaced byThomas Fleming, editor of Chronicles magazine. Mr. Fleming'sspeech grimly equated George Bush's &quot;New World Order&quot; withHitler's plans for world domination: &quot;Whether they are basedon racial superiority, on class struggle, or on human rights,all internationalisms come down to the same thing:nationalize resources, centralize power within a nation, andexpend lives and resources in a fruitless crusade to make theworld what we would like it to be. And what is true of Lenin,Hitler and {Woodrow} Wilson is equally true of George Bush.&quot;   Instead, Mr. Fleming proposed a &quot;new nationalism&quot; thatwould &quot;protect us from criminals, defend our borders from acontinuous invasion of illegal immigrants, and compete on anequal footing with the ultimate winners of the Second WorldWar, Germany and Japan.&quot;   This might seem hard to reconcile with the libertarianobjection to limits on individual freedom. The libertarianfaction of the club, however, showed a surprising readinessfor compromise. &quot;Wouldn't you agree,&quot; libertarian LlewellynRockwell asked a panelist who had criticized Mr. Buchanan'sprotectionism, &quot;that Mr. Bush's trade policies are aimed atworld government, world managed trade and world centralbanking, which makes whatever few tariffs Buchanan wants toimpose look pretty trivial?&quot;   The traditionalists, meanwhile, have adopted thelibertarians' mistrust of the U.S. government. Syndicatedcolumnist Joe Sobran observed that &quot;the United Statesgovernment has probably killed more people outside its ownborders than any other. Or am I missing something?&quot;   But the danger posed by Americans to the outside world isas nothing compared to the danger the outside world poses toAmerica. Mass third-world immigration, worried WashingtonTimes columist Sam Francis, is &quot;the principal cultural threatto American nationality.&quot; The movement behind the Buchanancandidacy must &quot;define our national commonality -- what itincludes and what it excludes.&quot;   One thing Buchananism certainly excludes, all theconferees agreed, is yesterday's observation of the birthdayof &quot;Mr. Martin Luther King&quot; (as they pointedly called thelate civil rights leader in reference to allegations that heplagiarized parts of his doctoral dissertation). &quot;I do notagree with the argument,&quot; Mr. Fleming said, &quot;that whiteAmericans somehow owe blacks a free ride because of whattheir great-grandparents supposedly suffered under slavery.&quot;   The definitive statement of what binds traditionalists andlibertarians together, however, was offered by MurrayRothbard, a libertarian and the Randolph Club's newpresident, at dinner on Saturday night. The Randolph Club, hesaid, is an attempt to revive the isolationist and anti-NewDeal Old Right of the 1930s and early 1940s.   That right had been decimated not, as is commonly thought,by Pearl Harbor, but by the appearance on the scene ofWilliam F. Buckley and National Review in the early 1950s:&quot;One after another, Buckley and National Review purged andexcommunicated all the radicals, all the non-respectables.Consider the rollcall: isolationists . . . anti-Zionists,libertarians, Ayn Randians, the John Birch Society, and allthose who continued, like the early National Review, to dareto oppose Martin Luther King and the civil rights revolutioneven after Buckley had changed and decided to embrace it.&quot;   But, Mr. Rothbard said happily, better times are coming:&quot;The original right, in all its heresies, is back] . . . PatBuchanan's race for the presidency has changed the face ofthe right wing. . . . He has created a new radical or hardright very much like the original right before NationalReview. For all their wealth, media influence, and seemingpower, it is now the official conservatives and theneoconservatives who are on the periphery.&quot;   In Mr. Buchanan, the sort of conservatism represented bythe John Randolph Club has for the first time since BarryGoldwater found itself a champion. If his campaign prospers,so will it. As for the Reaganite conservatism of free trade,active foreign policy and non-racialism -- well, to the gleeof the members of the John Randolph Club, that sort ofconservative now seems to have no choice but glumly tosupport Mr. Bush for four more years.   ---   Mr. Frum is an assistant features editor on the Journal'seditorial page.</TEXT></DOC>
