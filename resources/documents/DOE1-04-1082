The characteristic feature of 21-hydroxyderivatieis formation of complexes with metal-oxygen (macrocycle) {sigma}bond.Reactivity of cation acetylacetonate complexes (acac)/sub 2/M/sup +/with respect to macrocyclic derivatives changes in M=Co andgt; Fe andgt; Cr andgt; Pr,Ga series. The relative yield of metal-containing ions with a new metal-macrocyclebond is higher for methoxyderivative as compared to hydroxyanalogue.</TEXT></DOC>
