Joseph Corr, 45 years old, was named president of Trans World Airlines. Mr. Corr had been vice chairman and will continue as the airline's chief operating officer.    Carl C. Icahn, TWA's chairman, said that the company's board &quot;believes the title of president better reflects Corr's duties and responsibilities as chief operating officer.&quot;    The move eliminates from contention for the position of president Morton Ehrich, who had been TWA's executive vice president of planning and government affairs. Mr. Ehrich had been a top executive at Eastern Air Lines.    Mr. Corr was hired as TWA's vice chairman last April from ACF Industries Inc., a St. Louis-based maker of railroad freight cars that was acquired by Mr. Icahn in 1984. </TEXT></DOC>
