Of particular concern is a decrease in transmissivity,a parameter inversely related to the product of dielectric constant Kand loss tangent tan {delta}. Samples of polycrystalline Al/sub 2/O/sub3/ and BeO were irradiated to 1x10/sup 26/ n/m/sup 2/ at 660 K in theEBR-II fission reactor, and the above properties subsequently measuredat 95 GHz. It was found that K tan {delta} for both materials doubled,implying a doubling of thermal stresses and a consequent reduction oftime-to-failure from an assumed one year to 20 min for beryllia and 2s for alumina. In the case of BeO, a large increase in reflectance ofthe incident millimeter-wave power results from dielectrically uncompensatedswelling. This phenomenon could significantly degrade source performance.</TEXT></DOC>
