After having lost 4.4% of its value against the West German mark during the three previous days, the dollar recovered early yesterday on rumors of possible Japanese and West German interest-rate cuts and on profit-taking by speculators buying back dollars sold at higher levels earlier. The currency was also helped when West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told reporters in Bonn that he thinks the dollar is &quot;undervalued.&quot;    The dollar gave up most of its gains, however, after traders took comments by a White House spokesman as a further signal that the Reagan administration isn't opposed to a further drop in the currency's value.    Despite the dollar's improved performance yesterday, foreign-exchange traders haven't changed their negative view of the currency's outlook. &quot;This doesn't indicate that the downward trend is over by any means,&quot; said Garrett R. Glass, vice president of foreign exchange at First National Bank of Chicago. &quot;This is the crash that has long been dreaded. You'll know when its over when we get a very sharp recovery upward,&quot; he said.    The dollar got a lift yesterday from a Japanese news service report that Japan is considering new measures to try to stabilize exchange rates, including a cut in its discount rate, its central bank's lending fee to financial institutions. Lower Japanese interest rates would make dollar-denominated investments relatively more attractive, increasing demand for dollars.    There was also speculation about a possible West German discount-rate cut. &quot;If the dollar continues its downward trend, I see a rising possibility of a discount-rate cut in West Germany after the Jan. 25 elections,&quot; said Michael A. Gotthelf, vice president of foreign exchange at Berliner Handels andamp; Frankfurter Bank, New York.    In Bonn, Mr. Stoltenberg repeated his desire for drop in short-term, money-market interest rates, but he declined to endorse a cut in the Bundesbank's discount rate.    The dollar fell back from its highs after White House spokesman Albert Brashear, in answer to questions about a possible free-fall decline in the dollar, said, &quot;We don't have any particular concerns about one at this time.&quot;    Many traders interpreted the White House spokesman's remark as another signal that the administration welcomes a further drop in the dollar's value. &quot;It's a mild way of saying they would like to see the dollar lower,&quot; said Mr. Gotthelf.    The dollar's fall accelerated this week after a New York Times article quoted unidentified administration officials as saying the White House wants a weaker dollar to help reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit. Market participants didn't believe later White House denials of the report. &quot;Regardless of whether the administration wants to see the dollar go down, the market thinks it does,&quot; said Mr. Glass of First Chicago.    Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader at Bank of Tokyo, New York, said, &quot;Someone in the (Reagan) administration will have to say the dollar has fallen enough before the decline will end. Until such time, we have to say the dollar's trend is down.&quot;    But in Washington, U.S. officials continued to insist that the administration hasn't changed its policy since 1985, when Treasury Secretary James Baker decided the administration should act to bring the dollar down as a tactic to forestall protectionist legislation.    Yet administration officials have tried to avoid specifying exactly how far they want the dollar to fall. The single exception to this was the agreement with Japan last fall that gave general approval to a yen-dollar trading range of between 150 and 160 yen to the dollar. However, even while announcing that agreement, Treasury officials said the plateau should be only a temporary one and that the U.S. wouldn't intervene to support the yen-dollar rate at any level.    Mr. Baker's statements, from time to time, have been intepreted as approving one exchange rate or another. But the Treasury always maintains that his words have been misinterpreted and his consistent goal is to avoid sending the market any signal.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8358 West German marks, down from its intraday high of 1.8530, but up slightly from 1.8338 the day before. The dollar rose to 153.18 Japanese yen from 152.77; the unit traded as high as 154.20 yen.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 153.38 yen from 153.18 in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2 an ounce, to $415.90, in moderate trading estimated at 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $415.15 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                      CURRENCY RATES                         New York    Home Mkt.
