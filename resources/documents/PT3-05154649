The device is anatomically shaped in a      substantially yoke shaped configuration to extend around the user's torso      and provide support for either left-handed or right-handed feeding. Each      air chamber has an independent air valve to allow separate adjustment of      air pressure. This adjustability allows customized support and adaptation      for the size of the child, position of the user and child, and adaptation      with chair arms, bed railings, or other physical constraints. The      invention includes a removable elastic cover which provides a soft and      moisture absorbent outer surface which can be easily changed and washed.      The device is fully portable and can be deflated for storage or      transportation and folded up into small dimensions for convenient carrying      in a handbag or other suitable article. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The invention relates generally to a support device used when nursing or      bottle-feeding of infants. More specifically, the invention relates to an      inflatable ergonomic pillow to provide adjustable support for the user's      arms and back while the child is being held during mealtime. </PAR><PAR>  Bottle-feeding and breast-feeding of newborn babies requires the mother to      support and cradle the infant close to the bosom using her arm and elbow.      Prolonged or repetitive nursing often causes the mother to suffer pain and      fatigue in the elbows, arms, wrists and back. As a result, various devices      are employed to help support the weight of the infant and thereby make      nursing more comfortable. These devices have been developed from the      recognition that bottle and breast-feeding can be compromised when the      mother is uncomfortable and unable to provide adequate support for the      infant. </PAR><PAR>  In hospital situations for newborn or infant care, hospitals typically      provide conventional pillows to nursing mothers for use in a support      function. Commonly, only one such pillow is provided per bed. A      conventional bed pillow, however, must often be doubled-up or folded to      provide meaningful support under the mother's elbow and forearm and below      the infant's body. It is difficult for the mother to obtain sufficient      support using a conventional single pillow even when the mother is in the      sitting position. The problem is compounded in that most hospital beds are      narrow and have upwardly extending railings which inhibit proper      positioning of pillows when used to provide support on the side of the      mother below the elbow. </PAR><PAR>  One prior art device designed to provide nursing support employs foamed      material in the shape of a wedge. The foam wedge nursing support is      disadvantageous due to its relatively fixed size and configuration. When      such a foamed nursing support is configured to provide optimal support for      an extremely young and small infant, the dimensions will prove to be      inadequate within a short period of time as the infant grows in size.      Therefore, it is conceivable that several sized foam wedges would have to      be employed if the mother chooses to bottle or breast-feed the infant over      extended calendar periods of time. Additionally, foam structures can      potentially absorb moisture and are difficult to clean. Likewise,      conventional feather or foam bed pillows suffer from the same      disadvantages. </PAR><PAR>  Oval shaped, single chamber air mattresses have been employed to provide      support for arms during breast and bottlefeeding. These prior art devices      suffer from disadvantages associated with the shape and single chamber      construction. An oval shaped air cushion must be positioned about the      torso in a suitable manner to provide proper support for the mother's left      or right arm, as required. The oval shape does not lend itself to equal      support on both sides of the mother's body. Therefore, when the feeding      position changes, so must the position of the oval support. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, single air chamber construction fails to provide adequate      support without relatively high pressure inflation. Low pressure      inflation, however, may be necessary to reduce the height or size of the      air cushion for the particular application or to facilitate adaptation      around uneven surfaces, railings, arm rests or the like. When the      inflation pressure is reduced to accommodate these obstructions, the      support provided by the air pillow is compromised. In many circumstances,      it is not feasible to inflate a single chamber structure to the pressure      required to provide adequate support. The size of the child being fed,      position of the user, posture, and surrounding physical constraints all      impact where such an oval, single chamber air pillow must be positioned      and to what pressure it is inflated. As a result, in many circumstances,      these prior art devices prove to be inadequate. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, a multi-chambered,      anatomically-shaped nursing pillow is provided which furnishes fully      adjustable support and can be used either during right-handed or      left-handed bottle or breast-feeding without repositioning. The invention      has a substantially yoke or crescent shaped body incorporating two or more      separate air chambers which can be independently adjusted. The symmetrical      and anatomical shape of the nursing pillow is designed for use by men and      women and allows the device to be placed in front of the user's torso to      provide support on either side of the user below both the left and right      elbow and forearm. A detachable belt can be provided to secure the nursing      pillow about a users torso to restrict movement of the pillow during use. </PAR><PAR>  Each air chamber in the invention has an independent air valve which allows      adjustability of the air pressure to custom fit the support      characteristics to the size of the infant and the position and application      desired by the user. Each air chamber occupies the entire length and width      of the device. The air chambers are therefore stacked vertically to      provide a wide range of adjustability without compromising support for the      infant. The device is fully portable and can be deflated for storage or      transportation and folded up into small dimensions for convening carrying      in a handbag or other suitable article. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the nursing pillow is constructed of a durable,      polyvinylchloride (PVC) material to provide a high puncture-resistance.      The device includes a soft, fabric outer cover which is contoured to fit      over and fully envelope the device to provide a smooth, moisture absorbent      outer surface. The cover is removable to allow ease of washing and      replacement, and can include elastic material or panels to provide a snug      fit regardless of inflation pressure in the air chambers. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the invention      showing the two air chambers in the fully inflated position. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a side view of the device shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a top view of the device shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the invention shown in the condition and      separated from the removable cover, the removable cover illustrated with      an opening to allow placement of the air bladder member into the cover. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a perspective view of the invention shown being used by a mother      and supporting a child in the nursing position. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a side view of the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 1      illustrating the lower of the two chambers in a partially inflated      condition to allow adaptation of the invention over an uneven contoured      surface while providing level support. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a side view of the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 1,      illustrated having the upper of the two chambers in a partially deflated      condition. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the invention      having three independent air chambers. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention shown in the      fully-inflated condition and in the perspective view. Nursing pillow 2      includes yoke-shaped air bladder 4 having first air chamber 6 and second      air chamber 8. First air chamber 6 and second air chamber 8 are      independently inflatable, having first air valve 10 and second air valve      12 respectively. First air chamber 6 and second air chamber 8 share common      wall 22 indicated by broken lines. In the preferred embodiment, first air      chamber 6 occupies approximately one-half of the available volume of air      capacity of yoke-shaped air bladder 4. Second air chamber 8 occupies the      second half of the air volume available in yoke-shaped air bladder 4. </PAR><PAR>  Yoke-shaped air bladder 4 is ergonomically and anatomically shaped to      provide fully adjustable support for bottle or breast-feeding a child in      either the left-handed or right-handed configuration. Nursing pillow 2 is      constructing having a substantially yoke-shaped or crescent-shaped      configuration which, when inflated, is adapted to provide a support      surface around the front and each side of the users torso. Yoke-shaped air      bladder 4 is substantially symmetrical from side to side and top to      bottom. Therefore, there is no &quot;right&quot; side up dictated by the      construction of the invention. Yoke-shaped air bladder 4 generally has a      front portion 14, side portion 16 and side portion 18. Side portion 16 and      side portion 18 are separated by torso recess 20. It is intended that the      user position herself generally in the torso recess 20 such that front      portion 14 generally lies in front of the user and the side portions 16      and 18 generally lie on either side of the user's torso. Positioned in      this way, side portion 16 can be used to provide elbow support for the      user's right arm and side portion 18 can be used to provide support for      the user's left arm. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2, a front view is shown of the preferred embodiment      of the invention. Although the device is symmetrical as previously      described, for purposes of discussion, one side shall be designated upper      surface 24 and the opposite side shall be designated lower surface 26.      First air chamber 6 and second air chamber 8 are separated by common wall      22 which lies in a substantially horizontal plane when viewed from this      front view illustration. First air chamber 6 has first air valve 10 to      facilitate manual adjustment of air pressure within first air chamber 6.      Likewise, second air chamber 8 includes second air valve 12 which provides      for manual air pressure adjustability of second air chamber 8. Preferably,      yoke-shaped air bladder 4 is constructed using flexible polyvinylchloride      (PVC) material or acceptable substitute. Yoke-shaped air bladder can be      made using a plurality of independent plastic sheets which are connected      together at airtight seams using appropriate conventional bonding      techniques used in other air mattress or bladder type structures      well-known in the art. The material and thickness of the PVC or plastic      used to construct yoke-shaped air bladder 4 is selected to provide      sufficient puncture resistance and durability while allowing flexibility      and foldability for storage when in the deflated condition. </PAR><PAR>  First air valve 10 and second air valve 12 are preferably standard plastic      oral inflator valves which can be manually opened and closed by the user      and orally inflated. The valves are similar to those conventionally found      in everyday beach toys and pool floats. Alternatively, first air valve 10      and second air valve 12 can be configured to accept a small hand-held air      pump (not shown), a compressed air cartridge device or similar mechanical      inflator as desired. The construction materials used and the valve systems      employed should preferably be sufficient to withstand pressures between 5      and 20 psi. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 3, a top view of the preferred embodiment of the      invention is shown. The curvature of yokeshaped air bladder 4 is      specifically designed to provide a universal support surface which can be      used for either righthanded or left-handed feeding by men or women.      Generally speaking, the configuration includes front portion 14, side      portion 16 and side portion 18 as previously described. Side portion 16      and side portion 18 are generally separated by torso recess 20. In the      preferred embodiment, the invention is sized to have a width 27 of      approximately 29-30 inches. Depth 28 is preferably approximately 14      inches. Depth 29 of torso recess 20 preferably recedes approximately 7      inches. These dimensions are approximations for the fully inflated      condition. From the top view of FIG. 3, it is apparent that yoke-shaped      air bladder 4 has a region 50 of relatively large and essentially constant      radius, extending at each end into areas 51, 52 of smaller and decreasing      radius, converging at the recess 20 defined by a region 53 of reverse      curvature. </PAR><PAR>  Also, in the fully inflated condition, the preferred embodiment has height      25 of approximately 10 inches, with first air chamber 6 having an      approximate 5 inch height and second air chamber 8 having an approximate 5      inch height. These dimensions can be changed substantially according to      the particular application desired The preferred dimensions are merely      provided to show approximate sizing which can be used to construction the      device in a configuration which will provide suitable support for most      infants and adapt to a wide number of users. The dimensions can be      substantially changed to provide different sizes and configurations      without compromising the general benefits of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 4, the preferred embodiment of the invention is shown      including yoke-shaped air bladder 34, illustrated in the substantially      deflated condition, and removable cover 30. Cover 30 is constructed to      fully envelope and encase yoke-shaped air bladder 4, 34 when in the fully      inflated condition and provide a smooth, soft outer surface of nursing      pillow 2. Removable cover 30 is preferably fabricated from cotton fabric      and can be made in a wide range of colors and patterns to enhance      aesthetic appearance. Cotton 30 provides a substantially non-allergenic      fabric which is soft, durable, moisture absorbent and easily washable.      Alternatively, cover 30 can be fabricated from a wide range of suitable      materials such as sheepskin, fleece, nylon, LYCRA.RTM. EXPANDABLE FABRIC      (a registered trademark of DuPont Corporation), polypropylene, polyester,      POLARPLUS.RTM. fabric (a registered trademark of Malden Mills Industries,      Inc.) or other suitable materials or combinations as desired.      Additionally, elastic panels can be incorporated into the construction of      cover 30 to facilitate a tight fit regardless of inflation pressure of      yoke-shaped air bladder 4. </PAR><PAR>  Cover 30 includes opening flap 32 to allow air bladder 34 to be inserted      into and removed from cover 30. Preferably, opening flap is made to align      with first air valve 10 and second air valve 12. Opening flap 32 can be      made with overlapping material, have appropriate closures. Preferably,      VELCRO.RTM. (a registered trademark of Velcro U.S.A., Inc.) is used as a      closure device. Alternatively, a zipper, snaps, or other suitable      fasteners could be used. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 illustrates the invention being employed for its intended use. As      illustrated, the shape and configuration of nursing pillow 2 cradles the      user and provides fully adjustable support for the infant and the arms of      the user. Nursing pillow 2 is shown disposed about the torso of user 36,      having infant 38 in the bottle-nursing, or breast-feeding position. As      such, the elbow 40 of user 36 is supported by side portion 18. The body of      the infant 38 is supported by front portion 14 and partially by side      portion 16. The pressure of nursing pillow 2 can be adjusted to provide      variable height, support and cushioning for both user 36 and infant 38. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, a removable belt 48 can be provided to secure the nursing      pillow 2 around the users lower torso to restrict the air bladder 34 from      inadvertent movement away from the user during use. Belt 48 can be made of      any suitable material such as nylon, and is preferably fastened to air      bladder 34 using conventional clip fasteners or VELCRO.RTM. located along      side portions 16 and 18. Cover 30 includes access openings to allow belt      48 to be fastened to air bladder 34. Alternatively, belt 48 can be      constructed to attach directly to cover 30 using suitable means. </PAR><PAR>  The adjustability of the preferred dual chamber construction of yoke-shaped      air bladder 4 is shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrating a front view of the      preferred embodiment of the invention and the independent adjustability of      first air chamber 6 and second air chamber 8. Referring first to FIG. 6,      the preferred embodiment is shown having first air chamber 6 in the fully      inflated condition with second air chamber 8 in a partially inflated      condition. This configuration would be suitable in providing a firm      support upper surface 40 while allowing lower surface 42 to adapt to      surface irregularity and contours such as the user's legs when the device      is employed while in the sitting position, chair arm rests, or the like.      FIG. 7 illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention with first      air chamber 6 in the partially inflated condition and second air chamber 8      in the fully inflated condition. This configuration would be suitable to      allow a firm lower support surface 44 while providing a softer, more      cradling upper surface 46 which can be used to more comfortably cushion      the infant, or to reduce the vertical height of yoke-shaped air bladder 4      for the particular circumstances. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention. In the      alternative embodiment, nursing pillow 50 is made substantially as      previously described but having 3 substantially equal sized independent      air chambers. In this embodiment, yoke-shaped air bladder 52 includes      first air chamber 54, second air chamber 56 and third air chamber 58.      First air chamber 54 is coupled to first air valve 60, second air chamber      56 is coupled to second air valve 62, and third air chamber 58 is coupled      to third air valve 64. This embodiment of the invention incorporates all      the other attributes and characteristics including preferred dimensions as      discussed in the preferred embodiment with adjustments in the height of      each chamber as appropriate. The additional air chamber of the alternative      construction allows an added degree of adjustability for the user. For      example, in the alternative embodiment, second air chamber 56 can be      inflated to the fully inflated condition while first air chamber 54 and      third air chamber 58 can be partially inflated to allow adaptation to      irregular surfaces or to very vertical height of nursing pillow 50. In      this configuration, the fully inflated second air chamber 56 would provide      firm, and adequate support while yoke-shaped air bladder 52 would have      fully adaptability to contours and the irregular surfaces. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention      have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is      not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise      form disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are      possible in light of the above teaching. For example, yokeshaped air      bladder 4, 52, could be fabricated having a plurality of independent air      chambers in greater number than that discussed in the specification. Four,      five, or more chambers could be incorporated. Additionally, the air      chambers could be configured to be disposed within different locations of      yoke-shaped air bladder 4, 52 to provide enhanced adjustability as to      height of the device by providing independent air chambers for both first      side portion 16 and second side portion 18 as desired. As many air      chambers as desired could be incorporated to vary the adjustability of the      device. Additionally, one or more of the chambers could be filled with      other than air to provide a different fluid density or resiliency. Foam      pads or gels could be used. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiments chosen and described in this description were selected to      best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application      to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention      in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the      particular use contemplated.
