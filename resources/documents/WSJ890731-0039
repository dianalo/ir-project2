But it isn't clear whether this campaign will be any more effective than earlier ones that fizzled under resistance from party officials.    Already, the anti-corruption drive is generating a barrage of propaganda. News of the measures, approved at a meeting of the party Politburo Friday, was broadcast on television and carried in all major newspapers. The official Xinhua News Agency said Beijing residents &quot;responded positively&quot; to the announcement and quoted an unidentified middle-aged woman as saying &quot;the party should regain the confidence of the people by punishing corruption.&quot;    This isn't the first time China's leaders have gone after corruption. Last year, for example, then-party chief Zhao Ziyang kicked off an anti-graft campaign, stating, with apparent urgency, &quot;If we let matters drift, the {economic} reforms won't continue.&quot;    During that campaign, as in earlier ones, a few low and middle-ranking officials were arrested or dismissed. But no leading cadres or their family members were punished, fueling cynicism among the masses. And the corruption problem seemed only to get worse.    Now, in the wake of the student-led demonstrations, the party is trying to convince people it means business. &quot;Ultimately, the acid test isn't whether the latest campaign will stop corruption, but whether the masses will buy it,&quot; says a Western economic official in Beijing.    But the Politburo's measures suffer from ambiguity, the Western economist says. Many of the measures, described in the Politburo's circular as &quot;tasks of great concern,&quot; not as regulations, lack details and carry no specific legal sanction.    One measure, for example, says children and spouses of senior party and government officials can't work for trading companies or &quot;engage in commercial business.&quot; But, says the economist, &quot;It's hard to understand just what commercial business entails. Does this bar them from going out to buy a box of matches? Or does this mean they can't work for banks or law firms that specialize in business?&quot;    For foreigners, the &quot;clean-up&quot; of certain Chinese conglomerates is likely to have the most significant impact. One big trading concern, Kanghua Development Corp., is to be abolished. Kanghua has been involved in trade deals totaling $670 million since the company's founding in 1987.    Kanghua was targeted in last year's anti-corruption campaign. Before then, the trade and investment company had been linked to the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, a charity headed by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's crippled son, Deng Pufang. Because Kanghua raised money for the charity, it enjoyed tax-exempt status.    But an investigation into Kanghua revealed extensive corruption. Party and government officials associated with the company used their influence illegally to purchase relatively scarce goods sold at low, state-fixed prices and resell them on the free market for big profits.    According to a source, Kanghua's network of 170 branches nationwide frequently gave out big loans to officials connected to the company. At one stage, Kanghua, which is headed by former Petroleum Minister Tang Ke, was unable to track $16 million in siphoned funds.    As a result of the earlier investigation, Kanghua's links with the welfare fund were cut, depriving the company of its tax breaks. Kanghua also was forced to close its Hong Kong unit, Bring Fast Co. An internal investigation of the younger Mr. Deng turned up no personal wrongdoing, though his reputation remains tarnished.    Besides Kanghua, a second enterprise under the State Council, China Industry andamp; Commerce Economic Development Corp., is to be abolished.    The Politburo announcement said two other concerns, China International Trust and Investment Corp., or Citic, and Everbright Industrial Corp., will undergo public audits. Those companies, both with extensive business in Hong Kong, have been under investigation for months for possible corrupt practices. A third company also is to be audited: China Rural Trust andamp; Investment Corp., which is to be merged into the National Agricultural Investment Corp. Citic, often referred to as China's multinational, maintains deep links overseas. In Hong Kong, it acquired ailing Ka Wah Bank and bought a 12.5% share in Cathay Pacific Airways. The concern also owns stakes in an aluminum smelter in Australia, a pulp mill in Canada and timber interests in the U.S.    Everbright, similarly, maintains sizable overseas holdings, especially in Hong Kong. The company was set up in Hong Kong in 1983 by the &quot;red capitalist,&quot; Wang Guan Gying, brother-in-law of China's late President Liu Shaoqi.    The Politburo's measures also call for the following restrictions on top officials: -- An end to access to special, high-quality foods supplied through private stores.    --A halt to imports of sedans, plus a requirement that top officials use only Chinese-made cars. It isn't clear what will happen to the thousands of Mercedes-Benzes that now ferry officials around Beijing.    --An end to the use of public funds to entertain guests or send gifts.    --Limits on official visits to foreign countries. Officials can't accept invitations from foreign business executives to go abroad. </TEXT></DOC>
