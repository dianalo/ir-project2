Description of the Amendments</ITAG>The purposes of the amendments to the ITS Plan are (A) to recognize theuse of the ``Regional Computer Interface'' by the Boston Stock Exchange(``BSE'') (Third Amendment); (B) to allow for pre-opening application tobe based on the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')or the Ameerican Stock Exchange (``Amex'') in certain circumstances (EighthAmendment); (C) to clarify that a specialist/market-maker who has senta pre-opening response has a responsibility to seek a report of execution(Third Amendment); and (D) to clarify the procedures for resolving thirdparticipating market center trade-throughs (Third Amendment).A. BSE_Regional Computer Interface (Third Amendment)The proposed amendments to sections 1(33), 1(34A) and 1(34B) of the Planrecognize that the BSE will be utilizing the ``Regional Computer Interface''(``RCI'') as provided for in section 10(e) of the plan. Section 10(e),by its terms, provides that any participant shall be entitled to use oneof the four standard automated interfaces upon approval by the Commissonof appropriate amendments to the ITS Plan recognizing such use.Section 1(33) states ``participant Switch'' as applied to the BSE and theother regional exchanges means its regional switch. Section 1(34A) defines``RCI'' as the ``Regional Computer Interface,'' which is the automatedlinkage between the ITS and the Regional Switches that enable members locatedon the floor of the BSE and the other regional exchanges to participatein ITS applications. Furthermore, section 1(34B) defines ``Regional Switch''as the computerized system of the BSE and the other regional exchangeswhich permits entry and receipt of the ITS system communications by meansof CRT or other terminals, card readers and associated printers on thefloors of the regional exchanges, as appropriate.B. Pre-opening Application_Closing Prices (Eighth Amendment)The proposed amendment to section 7(a) of the Plan allows for the pre-openingapplication to be based on the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchaneor the American Stock Exchange in certain circumstances (Eighth Amendment).Section 7(a) of the Plan sets forth the substance of the pre-opening application,which sets out the procedures an exchange specialist who wishes to openhis market in an ITS stock may use to obtain any pre-opening interest inthat stock from other market-makers. Exhibit A to the Plan is a model rulethat states the substance of section 7(a) and specifies other requirementspertaining to the ``pre-opening application.''Section 7(a) and the model rule provide that if an exchange specialistanticipates that the opening transaction on the exchange will be at a pricethat represents a change from the security's previous day's consolidatedclosing price of more than the ``applicable price change,'' he shall notifyother participant markets by sending a pre-opening notification throughthe system. The ``applicable price changes'' are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s50,r50,r50</C> <H1>Security</H1><H1>Consolidated closing price</H1><H1>Applicable price change (more than)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Network A<D>Under $15</D><P>$15 or over</P><D>\1/8\ point.</D><P>\1/4\ point.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Network B<D>Under $5</D><P>$5 or over</P><D>\1/8\ Point.</D><P>\1/4\ point.</P></ITAG></ITAG>The amendment to section 7(a) deals with the occasional situation whena system problem will cause incorrect consolidated closing prices to bedisplayed in a participant market or markets. In these situations, thepractices has been to guage ``the applicable price change'' from the Amexor NYSE closing prices, rather than on the consolidated closing prices.However, this substitution requires telephone consultation with, and theconcurrence of, each of the ITS participant markets, usually just priorto the opening of trading.As proposed, if, on a broad scale, consolidated closing prices are incorrectlydisplayed, the Chairman of the ITS Operating Committee, upon the requestof the Amex or the NYSE, may designate that the Amex's or the NYSE's closingprices, as appropriate, be substituted for the purposes of the pre-openingapplication. The proposal provides a simple, efficient and timely meansfor accomplishing the substitution of closing prices.A collateral amendment to section (a)(viii) of the model rule recognizesthat each participant may designate that the Amex's or NYSE's last salesbe substituted for consolidated closing prices in accordance with the Planrevision.C. Pre-opening Application_Execution Reports (Third Amendment)A second amendment to the model rule would add section (c)(vi) to makeit clear that a specialist/market-maker who responds to a pre-opening notificationhas a responsibility to seek from the opening market-maker a report ofparticipation in the opening.The added section sets forth a basic responsibility to request a reportif one is not promptly received following the opening. If a report is requestedon or following the trade date, and a report is not received by 9:30 a.m.eastern time the following trading day, then a later-received report neednot, but may, be accepted. If a report is not requested, a report mustbe accepted until 4:00 p.m. eastern time on the third day following thetrade date. However, the section makes it clear that despite the provisionfor when a report is not requested, this provision is not intended to relievethe basic obligation to seek a report.D. Trade-Through Rule (Third Amendment)The last amendment is to sections (b)(3) (F) and (G) of Exhibit B (``Trade-ThroughRule'') and adds new section (b)(3)(H)(i). The purpose of this amendmentis to clarify the procedures for resolving third participating market centertrade-throughs (Third Amendment).Section 8(d)(i) of the ITS Plan sets forth the substance of trade-throughrestrictions. A trade-through is the occurrence of a transaction in oneparticipant market at a price inferior to the bid or offer in another participantmarket. Exhibit B to the Plan is a model Trade-Through Rule that sets forththe rights and obligations of members of the paticipant markets. The modelrule generally provides that, upon receipt of a timely administrative message,the member who caused the trade-through is obligated to satisfy the bidor offer traded through. The rule also contains several exemptions to theobligations to satisfy a trade through.An amendment to the model rule adds sections (b)(3)(H)(i) to provide anotherexemption to the satisfaction obligations of the Rule. The exemption providesthat, if a member who initiates a ``third participant market trade through''(as defined in the Rule) had sent a commitment to trade promptly followingthe trade-through to satisfy the bid or offer traded-through, and had precededthe commitment with an administrative message stating the the commitementwas in satisfaction of the trade-through, then such member shall have nofurther obligation to satisfy the trade-through. The provision is intendedto provide the receiving party with requisite information about the purposeof the commitment so that it can be properly acted on.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Implementation of the Amendments</ITAG>The amendments set forth in paragraph IA shall be effective upon the laterof (a) the execution of the Agreement by each of the participants and theapproval of the amendments by the Commission or (b) such date as the BSEshall specify. The revisions discussed in IB to section 7(a) of the ITSPlan and to Exhibits A and B of the Plan will require that each participantadopt the uniform rule revisions included as part of the amendments astheir own rules.
