Requests should be addressedto the Office of Special Counsel, 1120 Vermont Avenue NW., Suite 1100,Washington, DC 20005. Requests must be clearly and prominently marked ``Freedomof Information Act Request'' on both the envelope and the letter.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1820.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Categories of requesters under the Freedom of Information Act.</ITAG>There are four categories of requesters:(a) <T3>Commercial use requesters.</T3> These requesters seek information forthemselves or on behalf of someone else for a use or purpose that furtherscommercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person onwhose behalf the request is made. A requester will not be presumed to bea ``commercial use requester'' merely by submitting a request on corporateletterhead without further explanation of the use to which he plans toput the requested information. Similarly, a request submitted on the letterheadof a nonprofit organization without further explanation will not be presumedto be for a noncommercial purpose. The Office of Special Counsel will seekclarification from the requester where there is a reasonable doubt as tothe intended use of the information.(b) <T3>Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters. </T3>(1)An ``educational institution'' requester is associated with a preschool,a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduateor graduate higher education, or an institution of vocational or professionaleducation, that operates a program or programs of scholarly research, andseeks the information for a scholarly or scientific research goal of theinstitution, rather than for an individual goal.(2) A ``noncommercial scientific institution'' requester is associatedwith an institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis (asthat term is defined by paragraph (a) of this section), and which is operatedsolely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results ofwhich are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.(c) <T3>News media requesters.</T3> These requesters actively gather news forentities that are organized and operated to publish or broadcast news tothe public. Freelance journalists may be news media requesters if theycan demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a newsorganization (such as by producing a publication contract or citing theirpast publication records), even though not actually employed by it. ``News''means information about current events or information that would be ofcurrent interest to the public. News media ``entities'' include, but arenot limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the publicat large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances whenthey can qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their productsavailable for purchase or subscription by the general public.(d) All other requesters.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1820.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Free or partially free search time and partially free copying.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Free search time and partially free copying.</T3> Educational and noncommercialscientific institution requesters and news media requesters who are requestingrecords for noncommercial use are entitled to free copying for the first100 pages and free search time.(b) <T3>Partially free search time and partially free copying. </T3>Requesterswho are not commercial use requesters, educational or noncommercial scientificinstitution requesters, or news media requesters are ``all other requesters'',and are entitled to two hours of free search time and free copying forthe first 100 pages. Requests from record subjects for records about themselvesfiled in a system of records will continue to be treated under the feeprovisions of the Privacy Act, which permits the assessment of fees onlyfor copying.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1820.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Waiver or reduction of fees.</ITAG>(a) The Associate Special Counsel for Investigation, the Deputy AssociateSpecial Counsel for Prosecution, the Associate Special Counsel for Prosecution,the Deputy Special Counsel, and the Special Counsel may authorize waiveror reduction of fees that could otherwise be assessed if disclosure ofthe information requested:(1) Is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantlyto public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government,and(2) Is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.(b) Satisfaction of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be determinedby all of the following:(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the operationsor activities of the Government.'' The requested records concern identifiableoperations of activities of the Government, and the connection betweenthe records and the operations or activities is direct and clear, not remoteor attenuated;(2) Whether disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understandingof Government operations or activities. An analysis of the substantivecontent of the releasable portions of the requested records reveals meaningfullyinformative information on the operations or activities of the Governmentthat is not already in the public domain in duplicative or substantiallyidentical form;(3) Whether disclosure will contribute to ``public understanding.'' Consideringthe identity of the requester and his qualifications to make use of theinformation, disclosure will contribute to the understanding of the publicat large, and not to the individual understanding of the requester or anarrow segment of interested persons; and(4) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' topublic understanding of Government operations or activities. By an objectivestandard, the disclosure is likely to enhance the general public's understandingof the subject matter in question more than minimally.(c) Satisfaction of paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be determinedby both of the following:(1) Whether the requester has a commercial interest to be furthered bythe disclosure. The requester does not seek to further a commercial, trade,or profit interest, as those terms are commonly understood; and(2) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of therequester is sufficiently large, compared to the public interest in disclosure,that disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''If the requester has a commercial interest, that interest is not greaterthan the public interest to be served by disclosure of the requested records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1820.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees to be charged.</ITAG>(a) Requests for records are subject to the following fees:(1) <T3>Commercial use requesters. </T3>For search, review, and copying: Photocopiesper page, $0.25. Manual record search, $2.50 per quarter hour if conductedby a clerical employee; $5.00 per quarter hour if conducted by a professionalor managerial employee. Search fees may be assessed even if the recordsin question are not located or if the records located are determined tobe exempt from disclosure.(2) <T3>Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters, newsmedia requesters. </T3>For copying only: Photocopies per page, $0.25, excludingthe first 100 pages.(3) <T3>All other requesters. </T3>For search and copying only: Photocopiesper page (excluding the first 100 pages), $0.25. Manual record search (excludingthe first two hours), $2.50 per quarter hour if conducted by a clericalemployee; $5.00 per quarter hour if conducted by a professional or managerialemployee.(b) <T3>Method of search. </T3>(1) Any ``search'', which includes all timespent looking for material that is responsive to a request, will be donein the most efficient and least expensive manner in order to minimize costsfor both the agency and the requester.(2) For researches made by computer, costs will be assessed when the hourlycost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourlysalary plus 16 percent equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hoursof salary of the person performing the search.(c) <T3>Review charges. </T3>Only commercial use requesters will be chargedfor time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt frommandatory disclosure. These charges will be assessed only for initial review(i.e., the review undertaken when first analyzing the applicability ofa specific exemption to a particular record or portion of record), andnot for review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption alreadyapplied. However, charges will be assessed for a second review of recordsof portions of records withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequentlydetermined not to apply in order to determine the applicability of otherexemptions not previously considered. Review charges shall not includecosts incurred in resolving issues of law or policy that may be raisedin the course of processing a request.(d) <T3>Copying. </T3>A ``page'' of copying refers to a paper copy of standardsize, normally 8\1/2\andmin172;x11andmin172; or 11x14andmin172;. However, copiesmay also take the form of microform, audio-visual materials, or machinereadable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.(e) <T3>Nonassessment of fees. </T3>No fees will be assessed to any requester,including commercial use requesters, if the cost of routine collectionand processing of the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.To make this determination, the OSC will consider the administrative costsof receiving and recording a requester's remittance and processing thefee for deposit.(f) <T3>Other charges.</T3> Complying with requests for special services, suchas certification of records as true copies and sending records by specialmethods (e.g., express mail) is entirely at the discretion of the Office.Since neither the Freedom of Information Act nor its fee structure coversthese kinds of services, the OSC will assess fees to recover the full costsof providing these services should the Office elect to provide them.(g) <T3>Aggregating requests.</T3> If the Office of Special Counsel reasonablybelieves that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert isfiling a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment offees, the OSC may aggregate the requests and assess fees accordingly. Oneelement to be considered in determining reasonable belief is the time periodwithin which the requests are filed. Multiple requests of this type filedwithin a 30-day period may be presumed to have been made to avoid fees.In no case will the Office aggregate requests on unrelated subjects fromone requester.(h) <T3>Advance notice of fees.</T3> If it is likely that fees will exceed$25, the requester will first be notified of the estimated amount, unlessthe requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as highas those anticipated. The notice will offer the requester the opportunityto confer with personnel of the Office of the Special Counsel with theobject of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lowercost.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1820.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Payments and collections.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Payments.</T3> Payment of fees shall be made by check or money orderpayable to the United States Treasury.(b) <T3>Advance payments.</T3> A requester is not required to make an advancepayment unless:(1) The OSC estimates or determines that the requester may be requiredto pay fees in excess of $250, in which case the requester will be notifiedof the estimated cost. The requester must then furnish satisfactory assuranceof full payment if the requester has a history of prompt payment of Freedomof Information Act fees. If the requester has no history of payment, thenthe requester may be required to furnish an advance payment up to the fullestimated cost; or(2) The requester has previously failed to pay a fee assessed in a timelyfashion (i.e. within 30 days of the date of billing), in which case therequester may be required to_(i) Pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided inparagraph (d) of this section, or prove payment of the alleged amount inarrears, and(ii) Make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated cost beforea new or pending request will be processed.(c) <T3>Effect of nonpayment.</T3> When the OSC acts under either paragraph(b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the administrative time limitsprescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) of the Freedom of Information Act willbegin only after the fee payments described above have been received.(d) <T3>Interest charges.</T3> Interest may be charged to any requester whofails to pay fees assessed within 30 days of the date of billing. Interestwill be assessed on the 31st day following the day on which the bill forfees was sent, and will be calculated at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C.3717. Receipt of fees, even if not processed, will stay the accrual ofinterest.(e) <T3>Collections.</T3> If the OSC deems it appropriate in order to encouragerepayment of fees assessed in accordance with these regulations, the OSCwill use the procedures authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (PublicLaw No. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies anduse of collection agencies.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1820.8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appeals.</ITAG>Any denial, in whole or in part, of a request for records of the Officeof Special Counsel shall advise the requester of his right to appeal thedenial to the Special Counsel or the Special Counsel's designee.
