The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, along withthe Commerce Department, announced Monday they have hired GeneralDynamics Corp. to be responsible for designing, building andlaunching the rockets that will put three weather satellites inorbit at a cost of $200 million. The satellites are built by FordAerospace.   The contract carries an option for two more launches ofGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites for anadditional $103 million.   ``This contract is the first U.S. government procurement ofcommercial launch transportation services and ushers in a new erain the commercialization of space,'' NASA said.   The first of the new series of weather satellites is scheduledfor launch in March 1990 from Cape Canaveral, Fla.   President Reagan, in his new space policy, ordered NASA to usecommercial services as much as possible.   Until now, NASA has bought rockets from private contractors,prepared them for flight and then supervised their launch. The newcontract lays all that, as well as responsibility for missionsuccess, in the lap of General Dynamics.   The satellites will be launched for the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration. GOES spacecraft provide visible andinfrared images of weather systems over the Earth, and areespecially valuable for spotting hurricanes and other storms early.</TEXT></DOC>
