Hundreds of students armed with clubs and firebombs brieflydisrupted rush hour traffic in central Seoul in the early evening,storming out of sidestreets to attack riot police units. Protestersset fire to a police bus, but troopers hurling tear gas grenadesquickly dispersed the students.   Police said they had no figures on arrests or injuries.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Drive out the Yankees!,'' theprotesters chanted.   The radicals are calling for the overthrow of Roh, reunificationwith North Korea and the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops basedin South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.   Riot police arrested and beat several dozen students in theclashes in Seoul. Some pedestrians, choking and crying from teargas, yelled insults at troops, and scuffles ensued.   Authorities, fearing major protests in Seoul, fielded 21,000riot police, officials said. Troopers in green combat fatigues andblack-visored helmets guarded government buildings, the U.S.Embassy and other possible targets.

Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, estimated about 5,000students took part in the clashes in the provincial cities. Therewas no estimate on how many students were involved in the protestsin Seoul, but several thousand took part in peaceful campusprotests before the clashes.
