The cavity, locatedin the Tatum salt domain (near Hattiesburg, Mississippi), had been createdby a 5.3 kt tamped explosion more than 2 years earlier (Almon event).Analysis of data obtained in SALMON and STERLING indicated a corner frequencyfor STERLING near 10 Hz, a factor of 4 less than predicted by the simplestdecoupling theory. We have performed a comprehensive re-examination ofthe experimental records and find that the original report was incorrect,a consequence of not properly accounting for noise in the seismic analysis.The new study, based on direct spectral analysis of the free-field data,indicates that the STERLING experiment was in near perfect agreementwith theory. This is a potentially significant result for seismic monitoringof a low-yield threshold test ban.</TEXT></DOC>
