The Royal Dutch/Shell Group unit estimated the field's size at about two trillion cubic feet, making it &quot;one of the most significant discoveries made in the western Canadian basin in the past 20 years.&quot; The basin includes Alberta and parts of British Columbia and Saskatchewan.    Since exploratory drilling is at an early stage, Shell said, the company added only net proved reserves from the three wells already drilled in the discovery area to its 1986 year-end reserves. These include 85 billion cubic feet of gas, five million barrels of condensate, and 2.5 million metric tons of sulfur.    Shell said tests at the three exploration wells show a daily flow rate per well of 25 million cubic feet of rich gas, from which other gas products are derived.    Shell, Canada's largest gas producer, said it acquired rights to 50% of the field, with six companies sharing the other 50%. Further exploratory drilling is planned, Shell said, and production likely will begin early in the 1990s.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Shell common closed at $33 (Canadian) a share, up $1.75. </TEXT></DOC>
