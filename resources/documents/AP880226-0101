Reagan, in an interview published in today's Washington Post,also said he believes it is still possible for the treaty to becompleted and signed before he leaves office in January.   U.S. and Soviet negotiatiors had hoped to have the treaty readyfor Reagan to sign with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when thetwo meet in Moscow in May or June.   Fitzwater said the president's statements did not represent anymajor change in the U.S. position.   ``The president said the same thing that I have said here manytimes, that Secretary (of State George) Shultz and others havesaid, and that is that we are working on a START agreement; if wecan get one that will be done in time to sign at the summit, thatwould be great; but, realistically, it doesn't appear that's likelyto happen.''   ``The president was just being realistic,'' Fitzwater said.   During a 30-minute Oval Office interview with the Post onThursday, Reagan was asked whether he expected to sign the treatyto reduce strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons by 50 percentduring the summit.   ``That would be nice, if it could happen, but I have to tell youthat common sense indicates that the time is too limited for us toreally think that we could bring a treaty ready for signature tothat meeting,'' Reagan said.   ``We're not at this moment anticipating that it would be readyfor signature then,'' he said.   Reagan said the negotiations being conducted by representativesof both sides at the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks in Geneva arefar more complex than those that preceded the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty, which was signed by the two leaders duringthe Washington summit in December. The INF treaty eliminatedshort-and intermediate-range missiles from Europe. It is awaitingaction by the Senate.   ``This one is so much more complicated with regard toverification and everything else than the INF Treaty, which we wereable to bring together. But even that took a few months to do,''Reagan said.   ``I believe with the amount of time that would still beremaining that, if there is sincerity on both sides with regard togetting such an agreement _ and I think there is _ I think thatcould be done ... before my time expired,'' he said.   He reiterated that he would not use the Strategic DefenseInitiative _ known as Star Wars _ as a bargaining chip innegotiations with the Soviet Union.   ``I have told him (Gorbachev) every time. ... If it is thatgood, we are going to deploy it. We see it as the basis then foreliminating the strategic ballistic missiles on both sides. And Ihave even told him that I would be willing to see this shared,''the president said.   Reagan also said National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powelland Secretary of State George P. Shultz are convinced the Sovietswant to pull out of Afghanistan, where they have been battlingU.S.-backed rebels.   ``I think that a large part of that could be the economicsituation in the Soviet Union and the fact that, after going onnine years, it's still a stalemate. So I think that there's reasonto believe that they really want out,'' he said.   A group of senators back from a tour of NATO capitals said theywon assurances from Reagan on Thursday that the strategic armstreaty would not be rushed through simply to have it ready forsigning at the Moscow summit.   ``I am very concerned that the START agreement not be based onthe calendar, the day of the month, that it not be governed bymeeting a deadline,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,D-W.Va.   He said he was assured that would not be the case.   On Monday, during Shultz's talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow,U.S. and Soviet negotiators at the START talks in Geneva had beendirected to prepare within a month three draft agreements for atreaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50percent.   Draft accords on verification, disposing of weapons and exchangeof information are to be ready for the next meeting between Shultzand Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, scheduled forMarch 22-23 in Washington.   Other issues covered during the Post interview included:   _The U.S. budget deficit: ``It's a burden. There's no questionabout that. But ... not the disaster some people proclaim. ... Oneof the major factors in our budget right now is the interest. Butwho gets that interest? And you find out then that a great manyinstitutions, universities, educational institutions of all kinds,that part of their endowment are government bonds. And so a lot ofthat interest is going to them ... (and) to individual Americans.''   _Former White House aides Michael Deaver, convicted of perjuryfor lying about his lobbying activities, and Lyn Nofziger,convicted of illegal lobbying, and Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII, who is being investigated by an independent counsel: ``Ofcourse, I am saddened. ... I found all those individuals to be thevery soul of integrity in the more than 20 years that I have knownthem.''</TEXT></DOC>
