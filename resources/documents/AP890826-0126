In New Jersey, 137 anti-abortion advocates were arrested in ademonstration that forced the temporary closing of a Cherry Hillabortion clinic. Police in Columbia, Mo., arrested 44 anti-abortiondemonstrators who blocked the doors to a Planned Parenthood clinicfor nearly four hours Saturday.   On the opposite side of the issue, 400 pro-choice demonstratorsturned out for a six-mile walk-a-thon along the Atlantic Cityboardwalk. The event was sponsored by the National Organization forWomen and NOW-New Jersey to raise money for the state chapter'sPolitical Action Committee.   National NOW President Molly Yard said the march in New Jerseyhelped identify candidates for the state Legislature who support theright to an abortion and would get the word to voters.   ``Voters in this country do believe that it's up to a woman todecide what happens to her body,'' Ms. Yard said.   Referring to the Supreme Court's decision this summer givingstates the right to regulate abortion, Ms. Yard said: ``Americanwomen are very mad about what happened, and they're not going totake it any more. And there are a lot of men who support that.''   About 200 anti-abortion advocates protested outside the CherryHill Women's Center early Saturday morning. Those arrested werecharged with defiant trespassing for blocking the center'sentrances, said Police Sgt. Edward Morton.   At the Columbia, Mo., clinic, police charged the ``OperationRescue'' members, most from the Kansas City area, with trespassingand released them on their own recognizance, said Deputy ChiefCarroll Highbarger.   Several abortion-rights activists held a counter-demonstration.``They yelled back and forth, but that was it,'' Highbarger said.   Women waiting for abortions or to pick up birth control goodsremained in a parking lot across the street until the clinic opened,said India McCanse, the clinic's community affairs director. Somewere upset, but none left, she said.   The clinic performs 10 to 12 abortions on a typical Saturday,McCanse said.   In the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kan., three peoplewho attempted to block the entrance to the Comprehensive Health forWomen clinic also were arrested on trespassing charges Saturday.   Lt.
