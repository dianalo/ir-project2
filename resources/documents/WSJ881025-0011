Cray also reported that net for the third quarter fell 37% as revenue dropped 21%. Net was $22.6 million, or 73 cents a share, down from $36.1 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $145.2 million from $184.6 million.    The company, which dominates the supercomputer industry, said earnings for 1988 would grow 5% to 7%, largely because of $10 million in additional costs related to the Cray-3 machine now in development.    That supercomputer, designed by founder Seymour Cray, features circuits made of gallium arsenide, which are estimated to be perhaps 20 times faster than current circuits.    Company officials couldn't be reached for elaboration, but Gary P. Smaby, who follows the industry for Needham andamp; Co., said he understood that cooling problems had developed that could delay delivery of the machine. Originally, it had been expected to debut late next year.    Cray also forecast that more machines would be leased next year than previously thought. As a result, &quot;we anticipate overall revenue growth of approximately 10%, and we are budgeting next year's expenses accordingly.&quot;    Because of the erratic nature of its earnings in the past, Cray has sought to keep analysts well informed, but yesterday's news was a surprise. The company has scheduled a series of briefings with analysts today to explain its lower earnings forecast. Analysts had been expecting net for the year to increase by about 10%. </TEXT></DOC>
