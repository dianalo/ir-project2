The priest, however, is white. But Father Ernie Rudloff hasattended workshops on black preaching, and has learned to walk amongthe congregation while giving his sermon, to speak longer andlouder, to make a few jokes and invite an occasional ``Amen!'' fromhis almost all-black congregation.   ``Father Ernie is a black white priest,'' insists John Mitchell,a member of the Queens parish for three decades. ``He's adapting theold ways to please us.''   Rudloff and flock epitomize a dilemma facing the U.S. CatholicChurch: an expanding black laity and a dearth of black clergy.   The case of the Rev. George A. Stallings, a Washington priest whowas suspended after he formed his own church, has focused attentionon racial tensions in the church and blacks' desire for new forms ofworship.   But what some call the ``black Mass'' is a fait accompli in urbandioceses, and most black Catholics say they're most concerned withthe need for more black priests and lay leaders.   Rudloff _ a popular priest who makes no apologies for his race _sums up part of the problem this way: ``The black priests justaren't there.''   In the past five years the American church's black membership hasdoubled to 2 million, but there still are only 300 black priests _roughly the same as 15 years ago _ and 600 black nuns and otherreligious. Less than 100 of the nation's 1,000 predominantly blackparishes have a black pastor.   The diocese of Brooklyn has around 150,000 black Catholics, morethan any other American diocese, and more than a half dozenall-black parishes. But there are only two black pastors and only afew more black parish priests. At St. Catherine's there still are noblack deacons, although two are in training, and both the school andthe religious education program are headed by white nuns.   Black Catholics say that the paucity of black clergy and layleaders is a reflection of the church's historic racism _ a racismto which several parishioners at St. Catherine's can testify.   Charlie Bowen, a deaconate candidate, recalls life at a Catholicmilitary boarding school in Virginia where blacks and whites sat onseparate sides of the chapel. John Mitchell says that as a boy hewas thrown out of a church in Harlem by a white priest who thoughthe was going to steal something. And when he first came to St.Catherine's in 1956, he says, a white couple would not rise to lethim and his family get seats further down a pew.   Such experiences led them to sympathize with Stallings _ up to apoint.   ``If it's possible to be right and wrong, then Father Stallingsis right and wrong,'' says Bowen, who helps distribute holycommunion at morning Mass. ``There are problems in the church. Butif you have a problem in your family, you don't go out and startanother family.''   On Wednesday the nation's black Catholic bishops struck a similarnote, urging Stallings to return to the church and fight racism fromwithin it.   The bishops said they hoped Stallings and his followers ``are notcommingling personal disappointment, individually felt frustrationsand personal anger under the banner of racism.'' Racism, they said,``is too serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfishconcerns.''   Blacks at St. Catherine's are proud of their contribution to thechurch, especially singing and preaching. ``The traditional Mass wasso somber that by the time it was over you wanted to cry,'' saysMillicent Modeste. ``But you should have joy in your soul at church.It should give you a lift for the rest of the day.''   ``The Bible says, `Make a joyous noise,''' adds Mitchell. Thenoisemakers have come to include Charlotte Rydzewski, who first cameto St. Catherine's 35 years ago, when most parishioners were whitelike her. When the congregation takes up rocking Gospel hymns suchas ``God Never Fails,'' ``you can hear her all over the church,''Mitchell said.   The traditional Christian greeting of peace _ treated by manywhite Catholics as a perfunctory obligation _ ``resembles amini-coffee break here,'' says Rudloff, who walks up and down theaisle, shaking hands. ``We have to cut it off so we can get on withMass.''   At Our Lady of Charity in Brooklyn, a black pastor has taken whathe calls ``inculturization'' even further. There are drums as wellas an organ, a statue of a black Jesus over the altar, and prayersfor the release of Nelson Mandela from a South African jail. TheRev. Robert Seay wears a white African stole over his vestments.   The church's biggest liability in developing more priests likeSeay is its own history, including the use of slaves on Jesuit farmsin the first half of the 19th century. The relatively progressivearchdiocese of Chicago did not ordain its first black priest until1947, and separate churches for black Catholics were common in largecities well into the 1950s.   But in the 1960s the number of black Catholics increased 35percent _ more than half the new members were converts _ and todayimmigration and the popularity of urban parochial schools continueto extend Catholicism among blacks. Although the priest populationhas remained stagnant, there are 13 black bishops, includingArchbishop Eugene Marino of Atlanta, compared to one in 1968.   In 1987 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops created aSecretariat for Black Catholics, and more than 50 similar officeshave been set up in dioceses around the country.   Beverly Carroll is director of the secretariat. Black people havelong memories, she says, and the church ``has a long history toovercome. We had to struggle just to sit in church, let aloneminister.''   ``We suffer the sins of our fathers,'' says Seay. ``The church inearlier days refused to have an open door policy. Now we're payingfor that.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sun, July 16</NOTE></DOC>
