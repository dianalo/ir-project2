It is shown that the growth rates of these modes increasesignificantly when {beta}/sub p/ reaches its maximum value during thedischarge and therefore they can be used to explain the 'hard {beta}/subp/ saturation' behaviour. A simple estimate of the corresponding electronheat conductivity gives values of chi/sub e/andgt;1m/sup 2/center dots/sup-1/, in agreement with expectations from the observed confinement deteriorationat maximum beta.
