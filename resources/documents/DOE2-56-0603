<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-56-0603 </DOCNO><TEXT>A system for Prompt Neutron Activation Analysis (PNAA) with isotopic neutronsources is established. The fast neutrons from /sup 241/Am-Be neutronsources are moderated by a paraffin moderator and neutron capture gammarays spectra are measured with a Ge(Li) detector. The optimum experimentalconfiguration are determined. Some samples are measured using the PNAAtechnique.</TEXT></DOC>
