Statutory Background</ITAG>The Department has supervisory authority over the Federal National MortgageAssociation (FNMA) under title III of the National Housing Act and hasissued regulations governing FNMA that are codified at 24 CFR part 81.Now section 731(c) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and EnforcementAct of 1989 (FIRREA) gives the Secretary similar authority over the reconstitutedFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC).In addition, section 501 of FIRREA makes the Secretary a member of theOversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), which is createdto take over certain functions of the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorporation (FSLIC), along with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairmanof the Federal Reserve, and two independent members. The duties of theOversight Board are, among other things, to develop and establish overallstrategies, policies and goals for the RTC; to review rules, regulations,and procedures of the RTC; to review the overall performance of the RTCand require reports and audits; to establish a national advisory boardand regional advisory boards; and to authorize RTC's sale of capital certificatesto the newly created Resolution Funding Corporation.By virtue of section 702 of FIRREA, the Secretary of Housing and UrbanDevelopment is also one of the Directors of the Federal Housing FinanceBoard (FHFB), which succeeds to the credit and financing responsibilitiesof the now-abolished Federal Home Loan Bank Board over Federal Home LoanBanks. In addition to the Secretary, four citizens appointed by the Presidentand confirmed by the Senate will serve on this Board.

Coordination of the Secretary's Responsibilities</ITAG>There is a clear need for coordination of these new responsibilities ofthe Secretary under FIRREA with the Department's existing oversight authorityover FNMA and with the conduct of HUD's own programs.

The Under Secretarywill be the Chairman of the Regulatory Review Board, and the other membersof the Board shall be the President of the Government National MortgageAssociation (GNMA), the General Counsel, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-FHACommissioner, and the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research.At present, the Regulatory Review Board will assign one staff member toarrange meetings, prepare correspondence, draft option papers, and prepareBoard recommendations.
