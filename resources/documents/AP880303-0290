Hunting groups say the centuries-old practices should beprotected as part of France's national heritage. They maintain thatthe impact on bird flocks is trivial.   ``There is an anger which is in danger of exploding,'' saidHenry Sallenave, president of the regional hunting federation inthe Landes in southwestern France.   ``These are simple people living in contact with the land andthey don't understand the measures, since less than 1 percent ofthe migrating (bird) population is taken.''   Bird protectionists succeeded in 1979 in getting the EuropeanEconomic Community to ban such practices as the ``gluaux'' (gluey,lime-smeared sticks), ``matoles'' (a cage) and ``pantes'' (aspring-triggered net) to such birds as thrushes, skylarks, woodpigeons and swallows.   France agreed to the EEC directive, but contends that anexception in the agreement for ``judicious exploitation'' of smallnumbers of birds covers these traditional French hunting practices.   So trapping with gluaux has continued, although only in certainrural districts of southeastern France.   French officials argue that the ban should not be allowed towipe out a small, but significant part of living French history.   ``France is acting within the spirit of the EEC directive,because very few birds are taken,'' said Gerard Tendron, atechnical adviser at the French Environment Ministry.   But the EEC Commission disagreed and brought France before theEuropean Court in Luxembourg. A ruling is expected sometime thisspring.   In similar cases brought against Belgium, West Germany, Italyand the Netherlands, the European Court decided in favor of the ban.   Premier Jacques Chirac of France has promised French huntersthat the court rules in favor of the ban this time, he will try tohave the EEC directive changed so that it does not apply totraditional hunting.   When the thrushes begin to migrate in early October, huntersplant tall sticks smeared with bird lime, a kind of natural glueextracted from the holly bush. When the birds land on the sticks,their feet stick to them.   Few of the birds caught this way are killed and eaten. Most areput into cages and used to attract larger flocks that then arekilled by hunters with shotguns.   Hunting in this way is still allowable but limited to 30 sticksper hunter. Bird protectionists contend, however, that it is nextto impossible to police the limitations in rural regions.   In southwestern France, skylarks are trapped with the matole, acage perched on three small sticks that falls on top of a bird.   Wood pigeons and swallows are trapped in the Landes and thePyrennees with pantes, huge nets that operate on a system ofsprings to trap the birds inside.   Whole villages often turn out to shoo birds toward the nets setup in the fields.   Hunters claim these methods do no harm. Sallenave described thebirds trapped as ``a natural renewable capital'' and said theirmethods have little impact on the bird populations concerned.   Practitioners of the gluaux method say they take only 75,000thrushes a year while hunters with guns kill about 13 millionannually. The national hunting federation estimates that 30,000 ofthe 1.8 million hunters in France use the old-fashioned systems.   Antoine Reille of the Bird Protection League said his groupopposes these traditional hunting methods on he grounds that theyare not selective and a hunter may not always be able to recognizea protected bird and free it as he is required to do so by law.   He and other protectionists say protected robins and ortolansoften fall prey to the trappers. In the Landes, ortolans are aprized culinary delicacy, eaten whole.   The protectionists also say that by the time a hunter frees aprotected bird from the gluaux stick, its feathers are soimpregnated by the gluey substance that they fall out in a few daysand the bird dies of cold.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs March 8</NOTE></DOC>
