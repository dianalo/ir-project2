The addition of a small quantity offlux to coal has been studied as a measure for the problem. The fusionbehaviour of coal ash in the presence of CaO and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} fluxesand the relationship of fusion temperature drop with the eutectic texturewere investigated. A high-temperature type heating stage possible toheat up to 1750{sup 0}C was used in combination with an optical microscopefor the experiment. The result indicates that the effect according tothe ranks of coal can be mitigated by adding 0 to 30 Wt% of CaO fluxand 20 to 50 Wt% of FeO flux to the coal ash because the fusion temperaturedecreases to 1100{sup 0}C or under. It was estimated from the observationby the microscope combined with the heating stage that the fusion reactionbegins at about 920{sup 0}C and the coal ash forms local eutetic texture.(7 figs, 1 tab, 2 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
