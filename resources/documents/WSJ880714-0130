Resigns 2 Of His Posts, Investors Take Over Board </HL><AUTHOR> Marilyn Chase (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> COO WNEWS </CO><DATELINE> PALO ALTO, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The president of Cooper Cos., Parker G. Montgomery, appeared to cede control of the board to members of two major investor groups, and relinquished his posts as chairman and chief executive officer.    In addition, Mr. Montgomery suggested in a news release that he may step down as president of the health-care products company after the Sept. 30 annual stockholders meeting.    The board and management changes came as James E. Gilleran and Robert W. Jamplis resigned as directors. Cooper named two new directors, Gary and Brad Singer, members of the Singer family, a significant holder in the company. The company designated existing director Howard P. Sturman and Gary Singer as co-chairmen of the board, and as co-chief executive officers.    While the board will continue to have nine members, the changes put a two-thirds majority in the hands of Howard, Bruce and Wayne Sturman, three brothers from Mount Vernon, N.Y.; and Gary, Brad and Steven Singer, of the Singer group. Mr. Montgomery and two other members of the company's old management continue to serve as directors.    At present, the two family holding groups are believed to control a total of just under 15% of Cooper Cos., with the Sturman family holding about 9.5% and the Singers holding between 4.8% and 4.9%.    The embattled 59-year-old Mr. Montgomery is under pressure from investors to hasten the sale of parts or all of the company. Cooper is strapped for cash and needs the proceeds to pay off a heavy debt burden incurred under Mr. Montgomery's tenure.    Mr. Montgomery in the news release said he believes the shuffling of the board and management &quot;resolve amicably our differences over management of the company.&quot; He didn't elaborate on his future plans, or what executive authority he may retain, although he has said publicly that he is considering retirement.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Cooper Cos. stock slipped 25 cents to $10.625.    Dr. Jamplis, who is head of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, said in a telephone interview that his resignation from the Cooper Cos. board followed the elevation of Messrs. Sturman and Singer to co-chief executives. &quot;I don't know them, so I felt it was best to step down,&quot; he said, adding that he supports the sell-off as in the best interests of shareholders.    Mr. Gilleran, president of Commonwealth Financial Group Inc., a San Francisco consulting firm, declined comment on his board resignation just seven months after his appointment. Asked about the disagreements thus resolved, he said: &quot;Ask Mr. Montgomery.&quot;    Cooper said earlier this week that several potential buyers have expressed interest in the company's three principal businesses: optometric products, ophthalmic surgical products and diagnostics products. The company and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. are holding discussions with some of these parties in hopes of proposing specific transactions to a special independent committee of the board within 30 days.    Schering-Plough Corp., a Short Hills, N.J., drug company, last month dropped its plan to buy certain Cooper vision care businesses for $195 million.    Cooper has said it has enough cash to fund operations for now, but is trying to arrange $40 million of interim financing until it gets cash from the planned sales. As previously reported, in the second quarter ended April 30, Cooper's loss grew to $9.2 million from $6 million a year earlier.    A spokesman for the Sturman and Singer families issued a statement on behalf of the new management team. &quot;Together with our operating management and advisers, we will take immediate steps to sell extraneous assets and otherwise drastically reduce nonessential corporate overhead expenses,&quot; the statement said. &quot;As to the sale of the company's principal assets -- our operating divisions -- we will work actively with the company's financial and legal advisers to do whatever is necessary to realize the highest value these assets may bring.&quot;    The spokesman said he was constrained not to elaborate, and all parties to the managment shuffle had agreed not to comment further on the changes. </TEXT></DOC>
