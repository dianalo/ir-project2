Thisorder implements and supplements the requirements found in 43 CFR Subpart3160 as they apply to drilling operations, specifically, those requirementsfound at andSection;andSection; 3162.3-1, 3162.3-4, 3162.4-1, 3162.4-2, 3162.5-1,3162.5-2, and 3162.5-3. This Order addresses the Bureau of Land Management'suniform national standards for the minimum levels of performance expectedfrom lessees and operators when conducting drilling operations on Federaland Indian (except Osage Tribe) lands. The Order also details enforcementactions and prescribes the manner in which variances may be obtained fromspecific standards. The Bureau's specific existing internal guidelineson the subject of drilling operations have never been published formallyin a Notice to Lessees and Operators, so that this Order has no directpredecessor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Inquiries or suggestions should be sent to: Director(610), Bureau of Land Management, Room 601, Premier Building, 1800 C StreetNW., Washington, DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Howard A.

All Orders are promulgatedthrough the rulemaking process and, when issued in final form, apply ona nationwide basis. This final rulemaking contains such an Order, No. 2,Drilling Operations.This Order establishes specific and detailed requirements along with minimumstandards covering well control during drilling, casing and cementing,drilling mud and the circulating system, drill stem testing, special drillingoperations, related surface use, and the abandonment of drilling operations.These operation standards will be used in conjunction with the broad requirementsof Part 3160 and Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 1. This Order also classifiesall violations as minor or major. In addition, the Order establishes theprocess for initially classifying a violation as minor and reissuing theviolation as major if not corrected and continued drilling has increasedthe adverse impact.This Order sets standards designed to be minimums for drilling operationsat specific pressures under differing conditions and in different partsof the country. It is recognized that, under some conditions, additionalrequirements will be routinely imposed, or general variances to specificrequirements will be granted, either in approval documents or on a fieldbasis. In some instances, the Order relies on existing standards preparedby the American Petroleum Institute, the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, the Texas Railroad Commission, and other agencies. Thesestandards are generally accepted in the oil and gas industry.The proposed rulemaking for this Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2 was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 13, 1987 (52 FR 30310). The commentperiod ended on October 13, 1987. A total of 36 comments were received:24 from business entities, 8 from offices of Federal agencies, 2 from tradeassociations, 1 from an Indian tribe, and 1 from an individual. The commentsare discussed in the appropriate portions of this preamble where the provisionsof the Order they relate to are discussed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of II Definitions</ITAG>The proposed Order defined the term ``freeboard''. This term has been removedfrom the final rulemaking because the only reference to it was in the provisionon minimum standards for surface use, which has also been removed fromthe final rulemaking as explained elsewhere in this preamble.The term ``function test'' has been changed to ``functionally operated''for clarification. At the suggestion of a comment, the word ``wellbore''has been added to describe the type of pressures under discussion.The term ``H<T2>2</T2>S trim'' was removed in the final rulemaking since the finalrulemaking now contains no reference to this term.Several comments suggested changes to the term and definition for ``HighPressure Zone'' to include low pressure or lost circulation zones. Thisterm has been replaced throughout the Order by ``Abnormal Pressure Zone'',which refers to low pressure as well as high pressure, and the definitionmodified to reflect this distinction.The term ``fresh water'' has been removed from the Definitions and replacedby the term ``usable water'' wherever it occurred in the text. This Orderrequires the protection of usable water, which includes fresh water. Thestandard for ``usable water'' of 10,000 ppm. of total dissolved solidsis based on the regulatory definition by the Environmental Protection Agencyof ``drinking water'' at 40 CFR 144.3.A new definition for the term ``lessee'' is incorporated in this finalrulemaking to reflect a change in definition of the term in 43 CFR Part3160 since the Draft Order was published for comment.Several comments on the definition of ``mud for plugging purposes'' suggestedthat it too restrictive. By using this term, the proposed Order did notintend to exclude the use of other materials. Therefore, the final rulemakinghas adopted these comments and the definition has been expanded to includeother materials. Consultation with the authorized officer is encouragedto determine the need for mud for plugging purposes to assure that usageis consistent with environmental concerns and established operating practices.The term ``neat cement'' does not appear in the final rulemaking, and theterm has been removed from the definitions. The definition for ``tagging the plug'' has been modified at the suggestionof comments to remove the reference to an amount of weight not to be exceededwhen placing the weight of the drill pipe on the plug. This modificationwas made because no real purpose was served by placing a maximum on theamount of weight placed on the plug.At the suggestion of a comment, the definition for ``targeted tee or turn''has been modified slightly for increased clarity. The definition of ``test plug'' is also amended for clarity. The term ``exploratory well'' has been redefined to improve the descriptionof what constitutes an exploratory (wildcat) well. Seven additional terms have been added to the Definitions section in thisfinal rulemaking in response to comments received. The definition chosenfor each of these terms was either as defined by a referenced regulationor, when this was not the case, generally by the most commonly used definitionincorporating oil field vernacular. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of III Requirements</ITAG>A comment was received requesting clarification of the introductory portionof each ``Requirement'' section and the specific minimum standards thatare then listed below each of these requirement sections. The purpose ofthe Requirements section is to provide direction as to what is to be includedin the Application for Permit to Drill (APD), as well as to provide generaldirection as to the applicability of the minimum standards that followeach of these sections. Neither the Requirements sections nor the MinimumStandards sections are intended to stand alone. However, each section hasbeen reviewed, and clarification added as appropriate. A. Well Control RequirementsThis portion of the rulemaking contains perhaps the most detailed and technicalsection of the Onshore Order for Drilling Operations. The principal reasonfor this is the need to establish minimum standards by pressure ratingthe equipment being utilized. Therefore, even though there is duplicationin some of the minimum standards as they uniformly apply to 2M, 3M, 5M,and 10M and 15M systems, substantial differences in usage of equipmentrequire each pressure rating to be listed separately.A comment requested a definition of the term ``operational'' used in sectionIII A.1. A definition for this term has been included in the final rulemakingin the Definitions section. Other comments were received on this same section (III.A.1.) concerningthe criteria for establishing the pressure rating of the well control equipmentto be used. In the draft order these criteria were established ``assumingno fluid (except gas) in the hole''. The oil industry comments receivedon this section were critical of the criteria as being too restrictiveand suggestive of a worst-case scenario. While a worst-case scenario representsa legitimate method, used by a number of regulatory agencies and energycompanies in developing their design criteria for well control, a compromisehas been adopted in the final rulemaking because assuming a totally evacuatedhole (except gas) is too extreme to use for establishing minimum standards.The compromise wording adopted assumes a ``partially evacuated hole witha pressure gradient of 0.22 psi/ft.'' as the criteria for system design.This adopted pressure gradient parameter assumes a partially evacuatedhole whereby the hydrostatic pressure gradient is approximately doublethat assumed in the draft order. It also represents approximately one-halfthe hydrostatic pressure of a column of water. In addition to being aneasily remembered specification, it also represents an appropriate compromiseand a legitimate minimum design criterion. A comment was received concerning section III.A.2. suggesting that theOrder should establish well control training provisions. Although thisconcept has merit, well control training for operators is not within theidentified scope of this rulemaking and accordingly is not addressed here.However, this comment has been referred to appropriate BLM personnel forseparate consideration. Minimum standard III.A.i. has been editorially modified for clarity byadding the words ``well control'' in describing the device required assuggested in the comments received. The minimum standard III.A.ii. for 2M systems has been modified as suggestedin comments to clarify that an ``annular preventer, double ram or two ramswith one being a blind and one being a pipe ram,'' is required. This wasthe intention of the minimum standard contained in the draft Order, butas written could have been understood to require 4 rams, with 1 being adouble, and including a blind and a pipe ram as well. The minimum standard for III.A.iii. received several comments. Some ofthese noted that 3M systems are the ones most commonly available in someregions. Their use, it was noted, was predicted on availability ratherthan necessity. Compliance with the provisions of this Order is considereda minimum requirement. As stated in I.D.1., higher rated equipment maybe used to meet and maintain these standards without being held to thehigher standards normally applied to such equipment. Therefore, if thepressure expected is in the 2M category, the operator should state thisin the application. The use of equipment of a higher pressure rating thanthat approved does not subject the operator to the specifications for thehigher pressure rated equipment. Operators are reminded to base requestsor equipment approval on this understanding. Since I.D.1. clearly addressesthe above mentioned concerns, no further explanation or modification wasdeemed necessary in the text of the final rulemaking. It should be notedthat if drilling were to occur in an area where a 2M system was appropriateand approved, the use of a 3M system without, for example, an annular preventer(which is not required in a 2M system) is, of course, fully acceptable.Accordingly, along with the more liberal assumption of a .22 psi/ft fluidin the hole rather than fully evacuated, as explained earlier, the standardis now appropriate without further modification and as such is consistentwith API RP53.Another comment on this section addressed the draft minimum standard fora drilling spool with side outlet connections. The comment stated thatthis was too restrictive because the blowout preventer (BOP) itself couldhave side outlets and functions in the same manner as the drilling spool.The final rulemaking has been modified to allow for this type of equipmentand usage not only for a 3M system but for higher rated pressure systemsas well.The minimum standard in the final rulemaking for 2 kill line valves wasmodified from the draft as suggested by a comment to permit one of thetwo valves to be a check valve to clarify the intent of the Order. The minimum standard for safety valves and subs was modified as suggestedby comments to clarify intent and now reads ``safety valve and subs tofit all drill string connections in use''. This has been modified similarlyin the requirements for higher rated systems as well. The term ``BOPE'' was added to the minimum standard for clarification.It now reads, ``All BOPE connections subject to well pressure shall beflanged, welded, or clamped.'' Connections not subjected to well pressurein the cellar, for example, or those connections upstream from check valves,etc., could be hammer unions as some comments suggested. The minimum standardaddresses only those connections directly subject to well pressure conditions.This same modification has been made to the minimum standards for higherrated systems. The minimum standards for 5M systems in section III.A.iv. generated numerouscomments, many of which addressed similar items and nearly all of whichsuggested minor changes for clarity. As noted below, these changes werefor the most part incorporated in this final rulemaking. The second item in the minimum standards for 5M systems has been completelyreworded at the suggestion of comments and broken into 2 separate standardsto improve clarity and expound the original intent concerning the appropriateusage of a second pipe ram. The use of remote kill line on a 5M system received several conflictingcomments. This minimum standard is retained as proposed, because it reflectsan appropriate and necessary minimum standard.Comments were received suggesting that the minimum standard in the draftrequiring an inside BOP or float sub was not appropriate and did not representa true minimum standard. The requirement has not been removed, becausehaving an inside BOP or float sub on site that will fit the drill stringis standard procedure and necessary to prevent blowouts. However, thisstandard has been amended to apply specifically to drill string connectionsin use rather than the entire string.The minimum standards for 10M and 15M systems in section III.A.2.a.v. receivedgeneral comments expressing satisfaction with all the specified standardsas being appropriate and necessary given the high relative pressures underconsideration. However, other useful comments were received as discussedbelow which addressed issues that warranted further consideration.The minimum standard for a rotating head if conditions warrant as requiredin the draft Order was removed since it was not stated as a true minimumstandard. The authorized officer at the time the APD is approved alwayshas the discretionary authority to require additional equipment if conditionswarrant.Two comments addressed the minimum standard that requires ``3 chokes, 1being remotely controlled.'' This standard remains as stated in the draftOrder since this requirement is well-accepted operating practice and representsan appropriate minimum standard.The requirement for a wear ring received several comments. These rangedfrom the belief that a wear ring is appropriate for all pressure systemsto the belief that a wear ring is inappropriate for any system. The minimumstandard for a wear ring on 10M and 15M systems has been retained in thefinal rulemaking in realization that detecting significant wear particularlyin these higher rated systems is directly related to responsible well controlequipment requirements.The minimum standard in paragraph III.A.2.a.vii. attracted 1 comment suggestingdifferent wording to recognize the existence of alternative measures thatwould satisfy the intent of the standard. This minimum standard has beenmodified to accommodate this request.The minimum standard in paragraph III.A.2.b.i. generated several comments,some of which suggested that the choke lines should be anchored. This requirementhas been included in the final rulemaking. This minimum standard also receivedcomment concerning the requirement that the lines be straight unless turnsuse tee blocks or are targeted with running tees. This part of the minimumstandard was not further modified since it represents an appropriate minimumstandard consistent with established operating practice. Operators arereminded that if an instance occurs whereby a legitimate exception to thispractice is necessary a variance can be requested as explained elsewherein this Order.Several comments were received concerning paragraph III.A.2.b.ii., whichrelates to the choke manifold equipment configurations. This standard wasmodified for clarity to improve the original intended meaning. Severalvalves as shown on the drawing have been removed or their size reducedas suggested in comments since they did not serve an operational purposeand, therefore, were not true minimum standards. Another comment on thechoke manifold system urged that wording should be incorporated to statethat the system should be kept from freezing. Since the Order requiresthat all equipment shall be ``operational'', which includes keeping componentsfrom freezing or from being affected by any other factors that would renderthem non-operational, no greater specificity in this regard is necessary.As requested in comments, the requirements of this subpart have been clarifiedby the addition of minimum standards III.A.2.b.iii. and III.A.2.b.iv. Theseparagraphs more clearly specify the intent of the Order relating to unrestrictedflow for valve lines, and the design for pressure gauges.The pressure accumulator system minimum standards for 3M systems in sectionIII.A.2.c.ii. attracted several general and somewhat divergent comments.No consensus or necessity for modification was expressed, and the finalrulemaking in this section remains unchanged.The minimum standards for 5M accumulator systems in section III.A.2.c.iii.received several comments stating that, as worded, the standards were excessive.The compromise wording adopted attempts to address the concerns of thecomments. However, the 50 percent safety factor for 3 ram systems is retainedafter a review of manufacturers' recommendations as well as industry recommendedpractices since 5M and higher pressure rated systems typically requiremore stored volume due to higher BOP stacks, more piping length, etc.Paragraph III.A.2.f. was amended to reflect suggestions in several commentsoffering improved language to clarify the minimum standard for accumulatorpump capacity in accordance with conventional use. Under the revised minimumstandard, the accumulator system is to be isolated rather than removedfrom service for testing the pump. Furthermore, the pumps are requiredto be capable of obtaining a minimum of 200 psi pressure above the specifiedaccumulator precharge pressure. This change reflects a recognition thatthe 1200 psi standard in the proposed Order unduly restricted use of lowerpressure accumulator systems.Paragraph III.A.2.g. has been modified to specify how the valve positionis to be maintained, as requested in several comments.Paragraph III.A.2.h. generated several comments requesting modified language.A statement has been added to clarify the intent that remote controls arenot required for 2M systems. The requirement for remote controls for 3Msystems remains in place. Again, operators are reminded that if a 2M systemis adequate under the requirements of this Order, and the use of a 3M systemis being used only because of its availability, this should be noted atthe time of approval and the request for approval should reflect equipmentspecified to handle 2M pressure situations. Only the specifications necessaryfor 2M systems would be enforced.The minimum standard for well control equipment testing, III.A.2.i.i.,received a comment on acceptable test fluids. Clear water or an appropriateclear liquid for subfreezing temperatures with a viscosity similar to wateris required by this final rulemaking. Use of a drilling fluid rather thana clear liquid could mask and/or seal small leaks and, therefore, suchuse is not considered an appropriate practice or minimum standard, andthe rulemaking has been amended to specify liquid rather than fluid.The next provision providing minimum standards and enforcement provisionsfor well control equipment testing, in section III.A.2.i.ii., receivedcomments that expressed concern as to the period of time to maintain thepressure test. This minimum standard has been amended to effect a compromisebetween the draft Order and the varying comments received. The final rulemakingspecifies that the test shall be maintained for ``10 minutes or until theprovisions of the test are met, whichever is greater'' instead of the 15-minutetest period specified in the draft Order. Utilization of a test plug isaddressed in the final rulemaking along with accompanying provisions forits pressure testing.The length of test specified in III.A.2.i.iii. was similarly modified to``10 minutes or until provisions of the test are met''.Language in III.A.2.i.iv.B. is amended to make it clear that the test isto be performed when any seal subject to test pressure is broken.Minimum standard III.A.2.i.vii is amended to require that the annular preventershall be functionally operated at least weekly in order to determine whetherthe equipment is in working order without subjecting it to well bore pressures.This requirement would not significantly damage or cause premature wearof the rubber element.The minimum standard III.A.2.i.ix. was amended for clarity to include thewords ``pit level'' in describing the blowout prevention equipment (BOPE)drill to be conducted as suggested in a comment. This clarification refersto an exercise to be performed by the rig crew in response to a simulationof a gain in the mud pit level that would indicate an entry of fluid inthe well bore.B. Casing and Cementing RequirementsMany comments were received concerning the provisions for casing and cementing.Although the philosophy of what constitutes good minimum standards variedsomewhat throughout these comments, those comments that provided alternativelanguage to accomplish the perceived intent of the drafted standards wereespecially useful. The efforts of those commentators are especially appreciatedin resolving and arriving at the appropriate minimum standards herein incorporated.Numerous changes in the introductory language that precedes the minimumstandards have been made as the result of comments. The draft order inconsistentlyreferred to fresh water zones and to usable water zones needing protection.References to fresh water zones have been replaced with the term ``usablewater zones'' throughout this final rulemaking for consistency and forregulatory compliance since usable water zones, which include fresh waterzones, are also required to be protected.Comments also suggested alternatives to the term ``leasable mineral deposits.''This term has been replaced as suggested by the term ``valuable depositof minerals'' and is redefined as indicated in the definitions.The criterion for casing setting depth has been revised. The draft criterionattracted more comments than any other single item in the proposed rulemaking.This requirement as it appears in the final rulemaking is consistent withaccepted standard field operating practice and establishes the standardfor design assuming normal drilling operations and conditions. In thiscontext, the casing would not have to be designed to anticipate a completelyunloaded situation down-hole.The minimum design factors for tension, collapse, and burst have been removedin this final rulemaking, because of the great variations in calculationmethods within industry among companies and from region to region. However,the operator will be required to submit the design factors that were utilizedin his design for all exploratory wells and/or other wells as specifiedby the authorized officer.The casing design factors for formation pressure gradients and fracturegradients attracted several comments. However, since both items occur witha statement ``lacking better data'', there was a consensus that these criteriaare appropriate.The minimum clearance provision for a hole/casing annulus received considerablecomment. The necessity for an acceptable clearance was widely recognized,yet concern was expressed because of drill bit and casing size availabilityconsiderations. Several comments included excellent data on commonly acceptedhole/casing annulus clearances that are in part derived from drill bitand casing size availability. The most common example cited was the useof 7 inch casing in an 8 1/2 inch hole. This calculates to a 0.422 inchclearance on all sides, which, according to both the comments and furtherresearch within BLM, is the ``smallest'' prudent clearance necessary toprovide adequate isolation. Therefore, the final rulemaking establishes0.422 inch clearance on all sides as the minimum design criterion, replacing0.500 inch. Some comments strongly suggested that as much as 1 inch onall sides may be necessary, but the final rulemaking establishes a practicableminimum standard. It is recognized that there could be exceptions in uniquecircumstances when the operator or the authorized officer may wish to varythis requirement. These rare exceptions can be dealt with by requestingor requiring a variance as explained elsewhere in this Order. It shouldbe realized that, as with any minimum standard or requirement, the authorizedofficer may require an increased clearance depending on field conditions.For example, depending on circumstances, the authorized representativemay require additional clearance for surface casing strings.The ``waiting on cement'' time requirement drew several comments that differedwidely as to the suggested appropriate times. This requirement has beenamended to indicate that the time must be adequate to achieve a minimumof 500 psi compressive strength at the casing shoe prior to drilling out.This change was at the suggestion of comments received and represents thegenerally accepted field operating practice.The minimum standard for casing in item III.B.1.a. has been amended assuggested in comments to improve clarity and provide for consistency withsimilar regulatory standards. The standard is strengthened by requiringtesting and by requiring reconditioned casing to meet or exceed API standardsfor new casing.The minimum standard for liners in paragraph III.B.1.b. attracted commentssuggesting the overlap should be as much as 300 feet or as little as 50feet. Maintaining the minimum standard at 100 feet of overlap was deemedthe most appropriate to combine most beneficially safety and economy. Operatorsare free to exceed this minimum standard.An additional comment on this section suggested language making it clearwhen a pressure test for liners should be performed, and setting the standardsfor such a test. This suggestion has been adopted in the final rulemaking.At the request of comments, minimum standard III.B.1.e. has been amendedto specify that the required report is to be made before running the nextstring of casing or before requesting plugging orders, whichever occursfirst.The minimum standard in paragraph III.B.1.f. received comments both onthe standard for placement of centralizers and on the standard for determiningthe corrective action. These comments have been adopted. The standardshave been amended to improve the likelihood of there being an adequatecement bond.Minimum standard III.B.1.g. for use of top and bottom plugs was amendedto improve clarity and to set forth acceptable alternatives for isolatingthe cement from contamination.Minimum standard III.B.1.h. on pressure testing casing strings has beenrephrased as suggested by comments in order to clarify the intent as wellas the technical reasoning. As published in the proposed rulemaking, thestandard for pressure testing_1 psi per foot of casing length_was an error,and the final Order returns to the standard that has been employed historically.One comment was received suggesting alternative wording to make minimumstandard III.B.1.i. on testing the pressure integrity of each casing shoemore flexible to meet varying pressure situations at different depths andin different formations. Recognizing that the well may not require a 5Msystem until it reaches greater depth, the suggested wording has been adopted.The final Order relaxes the requirement for portions of wells_generallythe upper portions_that may not require a 5M system.C. Mud Program RequirementsOne comment was received asking that the term ``mudding up'' be defined.The final rulemaking includes a definition of this term.In response to comments, the last sentence of the requirement statementfor this section was modified by replacing ``and'' with ``or'' in recognitionthat being relatively near a premix bulk mud supply is a sufficient andacceptable alternative to maintaining sufficient quantities of mud materialson site.For clarity and at the suggestion of a comment, the word ``equipment''has been added to the term ``visual mud-monitoring'' in minimum standardIII.C.2.Minimum standard III.C.3. of the mud program requirements has been modifiedas suggested by several comments to require having mud monitoring equipmentin place on all systems only when abnormal pressures are anticipated bythe operator. A definition of ``abnormal pressure'' has been added in thedefinitions section to clarify when the operator is required to have monitoringequipment in place. In exploration areas, applications for permit to drill(APD) will be approved only if they call for monitoring equipment to bein place, because in such situations there can be little or no basis foranticipating normal pressures.A change in the proposed Order at paragraph III.C.4. on testing for viscosity,density, and gel strength was made in response to comments stating thatthe Order should specify when it is necessary to begin requiring mud tests.This has been done in the final rulemaking by specifying that after muddingup, the tests should occur every 24 hours.Several comments were received objecting to the minimum standard III.C.5.on the use of trip tanks. The requirement only applies to 10M, 15M, andupgraded 5M systems. Systems in such high pressure situations are uniqueby their nature and require special equipment to aid in the detection ofkicks. This standard therefore remains unchanged, except that the authorizedofficer is given discretion, for 5M systems, to require a trip tank ifconditions warrant.Minimum standard III.C.6. on gas detection equipment has been completelyrewritten, at the suggestion of one comment, to add a provision for monitoringother hydrocarbon gases, such as methane, as well as hydrogen sulfide.An editorial change was also made to correct the H<T2>2</T2>S concentration listed from 100 ppm to 20 ppm.The language of standard III.C.7. on flare systems has been changed toimprove clarity by specifying that flare lines shall be positioned in theprevailing downwind direction from the gas source. In addition, the flareline discharge distance has been changed from 150 feet to 100 feet forconsistency with proposed Order 6, which is in preparation, and with standardsset by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Standard III.C.8. has been amended to require the installation of a mud-gasseparator (gasbuster) as specified at least 500 feet above the anticipatedhydrocarbon zone instead of 1,000 feet as stated in the proposed rulemaking,and only for systems of 10M or greater, or those where abnormal pressuresare anticipated even if the system is not 10M, rather than for all 5M orgreater systems as provided in the proposed rulemaking. Several commentsrequested this change, which will also be consistent with the proposedOrder 6 on H<T2>2</T2>S Operations. This approach is more reasonable and flexible.The standard applies only in those discrete areas where separators aremost likely to be needed. Additionally, the violation in the final rulemakingis classified as ``minor'' in recognition that the correction could readilybe made before encountering the anticipated hydrocarbon zone.D. Drill Stem Testing RequirementsA number of comments addressed the proposed prohibition of initiating drillstem testing (DST) outside of daylight hours. This provision has been modifiedto allow the authorized officer a degree of flexibility in approving DSTin recognition that in the northern latitudes and during the winter months,initiation of a DST in daylight may not be practicable. Special safetyrequirements may be imposed by the authorized officer in those instances.Also, closed chamber DST may be accomplished day or night and provisionfor this has been added as suggested in comments and to clarify the originalintention of the draft.Standards III.D.1. and D.2. were editorially amended for clarity as suggestedin comments.Standard III.D.3. on the location of combustion engines has been amendedto make it consistent with the OSHA requirement that they be located nocloser than 100 feet from the well bore, unless equipped with arrestersand/or water cooled exhaust manifolds.E. Special Drilling OperationsNumerous comments were received concerning this section. Many of theseaddressed the minimum distances specified. In response to these comments,all distances have been standardized and reduced to 100 feet. For example,the length of the blooie line, required to be 150 feet from the well borein the proposed rulemaking, is now 100 feet. In all cases, the distancesspecified in this final rulemaking pertaining to Special Drilling Operationsare consistent with similar requirements of OSHA.Another comment suggested modifying the minimum standard concerning thestraight run on the blooie line. This has been modified by the additionof the words ``unless otherwise approved'' because there may be instanceswhere a straight run may not be feasible.One comment suggested removal of the minimum standard requiring dedusterequipment during air/gas drilling. This comment was not adopted due tothe potentially serious environmental consequences. If an operator hasa special situation and can justify not using deduster equipment, he canrequest a variance of the authorized representative as detailed elsewherein this Order.As suggested in a comment, the minimum standard for containment of cuttingsand the circulating medium has been amended to specify the required modeof containment.Several comments dealt with the draft minimum standard requiring an automaticigniter and a continuous pilot light on the blooie line. This standardhas been modified to provide that either of these methods is acceptablerather than both being required. Under certain circumstances the authorizedofficer may require both in approving a particular APD if redundancy isdesirable; however, it is not necessary to require both as a minimum standard.At the suggestion of several comments, the minimum standard concerningmud mixing equipment, mixing water, etc., was rewording for clarity.F. Surface UseComments from within government and from industry were received concerningthe minimum standards portion of the Surface Use Requirements. These commentsdid not particularly object to the stated minimum standard in the draft,but argued that this Order is not the appropriate place to outline specificsurface standards. Several comments suggested that a revision of OnshoreOrder No. 1 would be more appropriate. BLM has scheduled such a revisionto Onshore Order No. 1. In addition, under the Federal Onshore Oil andGas Leasing Reform Act of 1987, management of surface use on National Forestlands is required to be coordinated with the Forest Service. In responseto the comments, the minimum standards portion of the Surface Use Requirementshas been modified in this final rulemaking to contain a general standardto comply with the approved APD rather than specific standards.G. Drilling Abandonment RequirementsComments received on the drilling abandonment section of this Order arediscussed below as they address specific provisions.Two comments suggested amendment of the provision on types of mineral depositsrequiring protection. The term ``prospectively valuable deposit of minerals''has been added in the introductory paragraph of this section and to thedefinitions section of the Order to clarify an unnecessarily vague referenceto ``other minerals''.Another comment requested that the deadline for following up in writingan oral request for abandonment be increased from 5 business days to 10.This comment has not been adopted because an operator can ask for an extensionif additional time is needed.The minimum standard in paragraph III.G.1.i.a. on migrating fluids wasmodified as suggested in comments to make it clear that gases as well asliquids are considered fluids with a potential to migrate, and that formationscontaining them shall be cemented across in the prescribed manner. Anothercomment on this section wanted the term ``fluid'' to be defined as freshwater or hydrocarbon. This suggestion was rejected as being too restrictive.For example, salt water or nitrogen gas zones require cementing acrossso that contamination of other zones by migration does not occur.The requirement in the draft Onshore Order specifying protection of lostcirculation zones during plugging has been removed at the suggestion ofcomments. However, as stated elsewhere in the Drilling Abandonment Requirements,the hole must be in a static condition at the time any plugs are placed,or the placement of additional plugs and/or cement may be required. Therefore,to assure a static well bore condition, lost circulation zones must bestabilized or isolated in some manner before further plugging can occurhigher up in the hole.The minimum standard in paragraph III.G.1.i.b. was modified as explainedearlier in this section to clarify the types of minerals needing protection.The minimum standard in paragraph III.G.1.ii. attracted comments questioningthe reasoning behind the requirement of an additional 10 percent of slurryfor each 1,000 feet of depth. This factor is included to compensate formud contamination (and not as a washout factor as supposed in some comments)in pumping the plug to the required depth. For a 100 foot plug locatedat 10,000 feet, this would amount to an additional 100 feet of cement column.Similar comments were received concerning this requirement as it appliesto cased holes. Since the logic for requiring this additional slurry isthe same, those comments are not addressed further in this section.The minimum standard in paragraph III.G.1.iv. was modified as suggestedby comments to make it clear that it pertains to thick sections of a singleformation. Another comment on this section preferred that extremely thicksections be defined as being 400 feet in thickness. This suggestion wasnot adopted because there are too many variables to select a particularnumber as ``extremely thick''. The authorized officer and the operatorrequesting plugging instructions need flexibility in determining whethera portion of a formation is extremely thick.The minimum standard in paragraph III.G.1.v. on plugging open holes wasmodified in this final rulemaking as suggested by a comment to recognizethat plugs shall be placed across in-gauge sections of the hole every 3,000feet, unless otherwise approved by the authorized officer. This changewill enable the authorized officer the flexibility to modify this requirementon a case-by-case basis.Two comments addressed the minimum standard in paragraph III.G.2.iii.,the amount of cement needed to cap a bridge plug when a bailer is used.The comments suggested 20 feet instead of the proposed 35 feet. The commentswere rejected because a lesser amount is not considered adequate. Thisrecognizes a policy based on Bureau of Land Management experience, requiring35 feet, that has been in place for many years. The requirement of 35 feetis already less than the 50 feet of plug required to cap the bridge plugwhen not using a bailer.Paragraph III.G.5. was amended because of a typographical error to requirethat at least the top 50 feet (instead of 100 feet) of the annulus shallbe plugged.The section on isolating medium, paragraph III.G.6. in this final rulemaking,was modified to clarify the types of minerals requiring protection as explainedabove. Another comment on this section suggested deleting the 15,000 poundmaximum tagging weight provision. This comment was adopted because settinga maximum weight to be used to tag a plug is unncessary.The minimum standard in paragraph III.G.8. of this final rulemaking hasbeen modified from the draft as suggested by a comment to clarify the cementplug requirement at the surface. This standard now states that the top50 feet of the hole shall be plugged and removes the reference restrictingthis plug to the smallest casing extending to the surface. All annuluseswithin 50 feet of the surface are to be plugged off. Another comment onthis provision suggested 100 feet of plug rather than 50 feet. This commentwas not adopted because 50 feet is adequate if propoerly placed.Paragraph III.G.10. concerning the surface cap was modified as suggestedby comments to improve the clarity and sequence. Another comment on thisminimum standard questioned the purpose of the weep hole. This term isdefined and explained in the definitions section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of IV Variances From Minimum Standard</ITAG>The only comments on this section requested the addition of provision fororal variances during emergency situations. The final rulemaking adoptsthis suggestion, although such requests by the operator are required tobe followed up by a written request as specified in the new wording. Thischange was incorporated in recognition that an emergency or other eventthat could not have been reasonably foreseen may occur during drillingoperations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Attachments</ITAG>Several comments were received concerning the choke manifold equipmentconfigurations. A statement has been added to each of the pressure systemsdiagrams in response to the comments to indicate that the configurationof the equipment may vary. This was the original intent and the additionof the statement improves clarity.Another comment requested that one of the two valves on the bleed lineto the pit be removed from the requirement for equipment for pressure ratingsof 3M and above. This comment was adopted for 3M systems, but was rejectedfor higher rated systems due to the higher pressures involved.The principal authors of this proposed rulemaking are Howard Lemm of theUtah State Office, Carl Budd of the Rock Springs District Office, Hal Stoopsof the Bakersfield District Office, and Bob Kent of the Washington Office,assisted by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management,Bureau of Land Management.It is hereby designated that this proposed rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required.The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).The information collection requirements contained in 43 CFR Part 3160 havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3> and assigned clearance numbers 1004-0134 and 1004-0136.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 3160</ITAG>Government contracts, Mineral royalties, Oil and gas exploration, Oil andgas production, Public lands_mineral resources, Indian lands_mineral resources,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Under the authorities cited below, Part 3160, Group 3100, Subchapter C,Chapter II of Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended asset forth below.<ITAG tagnum="20">October 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.

Introduction</ITAG>A. AuthorityThis order is established pursuant to the authority granted to the Secretaryof the Interior pursuant to various Federal and Indian mineral leasingstatutes and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. Thisauthority has been delegated to the Bureau of Land Management and is implementedby the onshore oil and gas operating regulations contained in 43 CFR Part3160. Section 3164.1 thereof specifically authorizes the Director, Bureauof Land Management, to issue Onshore Oil and Gas Orders when necessaryto implement and supplement the operating regulations and provides thatall such Orders shall be binding on the lessees and operators of Federaland restricted Indian (except Osage tribe) oil and gas leases that havebeen, or may hereafter be, issued.Specific authority for the provisions contained in this Order is foundat: andSection; 3162.3-1 <T3>Drilling Applications and Plans; </T3>andSection; 3162.3-4 <T3>Well Abandonment; </T3>andSection; 3162.4-1 <T3>Well Records and Reports; </T3>andSection; 3162.4-3 <T3>Samples, Tests, and Surveys; </T3>andSection; 3162.5-1 <T3>Environmental Obligations; </T3>andSection; 3162.5-2 <T3>Control of Wells; </T3>andSection; 3162.5-2(a) <T3>Drilling Wells; </T3>andSection; 3162.5-3 <T3>Safety Precautions; </T3>and Subpart 3163 Noncompliance and Assessment.B. PurposeThis onshore Order details the Bureau's uniform national standards forthe minimum levels of performance expected from lessees and operators whenconducting drilling operations on Federal and Indian lands (except OsageTribe) and for abandonment immediately following drilling. The purposealso is to identify the enforcement actions that will result when violationsof the minimum standards are found, and when those violations are not abatedin a timely manner.C. ScopeThis Order is applicable to all onshore Federal and Indian (except OsageTribe) oil and gas leases.D. General1. If an operator chooses to use higher rated equipment than that authorizedin the Application for Permit to Drill (APD), testing procedures shallapply to the approved working pressures, not the upgraded higher workingpressures.2. Some situations may exist either on a well-by-well or field-wide basiswhereby it is commonly accepted practice to vary a particular minimum standard(s)established in this Order. This situation may be resolved by requestinga variance (See section IV of this Order), by the inclusion of a stipulationto the APD, or by the issuance of a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL)by the appropriate BLM office.3. When a violation is discovered, and if it does not cause or threatenimmediate substantial and adverse impact on public health and safety, theenvironment, production accountability or royalty income, it will be classifiedas minor. The violation may be reissued as a major violation if not correctedduring the abatement period and continued drilling has changed the adverseimpact of the violation so that it meets the specific definition of a majorviolation.4. This Onshore Order is not intended to circumvent the reporting requirementsor compliance aspects that may be stated elsewhere in Existing NTL's, OnshoreOrders, etc. A lessee's compliance with the requirements of the regulationsin this Part shall not relieve the lessee of the obligation to comply withother applicable laws and regulations in accordance with 43 CFR 3162.5-1(c).Lessee's should give special attention to the automatic assessment provisionsin 43 CFR 3163.1(b).5. This Order is based upon the assumption that operations have been approvedin accordance with 43 CFR Part 3160 and Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 1.Failure to obtain approval prior to commencement of drilling or relatedoperations shall subject the operator to immediate assessment under 43CFR 3163.1(b)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">II.
