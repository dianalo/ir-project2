My fiance never seems to be able tofollow through on anything. He seems to just get started on something and thenhe stops and is off on something else. I don't know if I can spend the rest ofmy life like this.; -- The Other Half  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IF HE CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH, HE'LL BE THROUGH WITHYOU  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  GANGSTER OF LOVE  </MEMO><TEXT>     DEAR OTHER HALF: I bet your engagement ring is half a carat. Listen, I havethis buddy who has never finished anything. I once went shopping with him whenhe wanted to set up an aquarium. We were out all day but all he bought wasfish. He couldn't decide on what size tank he wanted. When I left him he saidhe'd get it the next day. I stopped by the next week and there were all thesefish still sitting around the house in baggies. When I harassed him about ithe claimed he's lived an entire life in a half a lifetime. &quot;I can start somany more things than the average person if I never finish anything,&quot; he saidproudly. &quot;Like raising goldfish on furniture?&quot; I asked. &quot;For one,&quot; he replied.You can't reason with a guy like that. But anyway, why on earth would youassume there's actually going to be a wedding?; DEAR GANGSTER: This guy'sgoin'. I just haven't figured out how yet. Should I heap his clothes on to thefront lawn? Should I change the locks while he's at work? I have to do it nowwhile I've got my nerve up.; -- Boots;   DEAR BOOTS: Just don't do what myscandalous neighbor did. Her beau kept stepping out on her so she got reallybold and decided to replace him while he was out one night. &quot;What a shockerit'll be,&quot; she bragged to me that morning. She had arranged to borrow herboss's husband and pawn him off as her new guy. He'd be stumbling in and comeface to face with her new man. His replacement. &quot;He'll freak,&quot; she giggled.&quot;I'll be sitting in this guy's lap guzzling a bottle of wine.&quot; Well, I don'tknow what want down that night; maybe it was the wine, but she got fired fromher job and the three of them are now living together. I heard they're lookingfor a &quot;smaller place.&quot;; DEAR GANGSTER: I'm still in shock. After goingtogether for a year and a half the guy I thought was The One dropped the bombon me that he was moving 3,000 miles away to try and win back his high schoolsweetheart. He's 24 years old. How can he even know what this girl is doingnow?; -- College Sweetheart;   DEAR SWEETHEART: He's got that &quot;Petite LittleDoll I Left Back Home&quot; syndrome. Believe me, he's been making calls. He's gotspies out. Men don't take chances like that. He knows exactly what hersituation is. He knows she just ended another relationship and is extremelyvulnerable. He knows she's been at the local tavern telling exaggeratedstories about Spirit Week '85 and that her voice lowers when she mentions Kentand how they first touched each other with papier-mache on their hands whilebuilding the sophomore float that turned out to look like a hunchbackedmermaid but was really just supposed to be a happy fish since the theme thatyear was &quot;Happy Fish.&quot; And he probably knows he can catch her on any Sunday upat the flea market dressed in a mothball-scented cheerleader skirt and hawkingmint condition 1987 JFK High yearbooks. All conjecture aside, if nothing else,he definitely knows how much she weighs.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911011  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  57  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  607  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 11, 199100285252,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
