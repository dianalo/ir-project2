The price for Geoff Nyarota's principles has been high.   A Cabinet minister threatened him with detention. Two of hisstaff were allegedly assaulted by a senior politician, and PresidentRobert Mugabe branded two of his reporters enemies of the country.   But Nyarota, editor of The Chronicle in Zimbabwe's second largestcity, Bulawayo, remains unbowed.   ``Where corruption exists, at whatever level, and we find out,we'll expose it,'' said the 37-year-old editor, a formerschoolteacher who broke into journalism with a muck-raking weeklynewspaper in the l970s.   The Chronicle's exposes are small change in Africa, wherewidespread graft infects most levels of society. But the stories areavidly read by Zimbabweans who have long suspected some of theirleaders of dipping into the national till.   In December, The Chronicle published the names of several Cabinetmembers, security chiefs and ranking bureaucrats who obtained carsand trucks directly from the state-run Willowvale assembly plant,then evidently resold them at a huge profit.   The Chronicle's front-page report was headlined ``WillowgateScandal.''   Private buyers who order cars must wait years for them, and thedemand has created a flourishing black market in which vehiclesfetch as much as five times their book value.   Defense Minister Enos Nkala was one of those questioned by TheChronicle's assistant editor, Davison Maruziva, on the whereaboutsof a car he bought.   Nkala demanded to know how the paper knew he had the vehicle, andhe threatened to send soldiers to detain Maruziva and his boss.   ``Where did you get that information?'' the minister reportedlyasked.   ``That information is supposed to be with the police and thepresident. I want that information here in my office ... If you donot travel here I will use the army to pick you up ... I am not thekind to play with.''   Two days later, most of The Chronicle's front page was devoted tofurther details of Willowgate.   The Chronicle, owned like all other daily and Sunday newspapersin Zimbabwe by the government-controlled Mass Media Trust, alsoquoted the defense minister as saying he and other politicians wereconsidering suing for libel.   ``Nyarota keeps pestering ministers, wanting to know whether westill have our cars,'' Nkala was quoted as saying. ``I am stillangry that I can be pestered by little Nyarota.''   The Chronicle, usually 12 pages printed on a 50-year-old press,has an average daily paid circulation of 65,000 mainly in theMatabeleland Province of western Zimbabwe.   For the issue that splashed the first Willowgate report, thepress worked overtime to produce 100,000 copies. All of them quicklysold out.   The Herald, the only daily published in the capital of Harare,has a nationwide circulation of 135,000, but many readers say itlacks the bite of The Chronicle.   The 4,000 copies of The Chronicle sent each day to Harare, 275miles away, are quickly snatched up from street vendors. Someentrepreneurs photocopy the paper and sell it in Harare's markets,bus stations and suburbs.   Chronicle editors say they could sell thousands more copies inMatabeland and in Harare were it not for a newsprint shortage.   Zimbabweans have reacted angrily to reports of corruption byleaders popularly elected on unfulfilled promises of givingZimbabwe's 8.2 million people a fair share of the public pie.   Thousands of university students, protesting mounting reports ofofficial graft, clashed violently with riot police in October.   Trade unions, church groups and individual readers have bombardedChronicle editors with statements and letters demanding independentinvestigations into the source of some politicians' wealth. Manylive in opulence beyond their means.   ``That you are courageous enough to ignore the threats againstyou, for exposing massive corruption, is something the public haslong waited for,'' wrote one reader. ``For our leaders to deplorethe muzzling of the press in South Africa, and yet advocate lockingyou up, is a clear example of the sheer hypocrisy we are witness todaily.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs Monday Jan. 9</NOTE></DOC>
