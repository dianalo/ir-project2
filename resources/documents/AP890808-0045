So far this year, 117 refugees have made the perilous journey toFlorida shores and several officials see no signs the latest wavewill abate as economic problems and political turmoil rattle Cuba.   Thousands of other Cubans arrive each year at MiamiInternational Airport with forged passports or travel documentsobtained in other Latin countries, such as Panama or Ecuador.   ``It's been the year of the Cuban refugee in Miami,'' said PerryRivkind, Immigration and Naturalization Service director inMiami.``This is the most we've seen in at least the past fiveyears.''   The U.S. Coast Guard in Miami reports that 59 Cubans were foundat sea last year and 44 were picked up in 1987.   Many of the Cubans make the journey across the Florida Straitsin small boats or makeshift vessels, such as inner tubes or rafts.Rivkind said some are washed overboard in rough seas or die ofdehydration or hunger.   Three Cubans who were picked up by a Soviet spy ship about 26miles southeast of Miami last month said they survived by catchinga sea bird and eating it raw. They said a fourth companion becamedelirious during the six-day voyage and plunged overboard.   ``There is no telling now many die trying to reach Florida,''said Rivkind, who announced his resignation on Monday after sixyears on the job.   Under federal immigration law, Cuban refugees with closerelatives in the United States are released in their custodyfollowing interviews with INS officials. Cubans with no ties areplaced in INS custody while asylum applications are processed, saidRivkind.   Since Cubans cannot be deported to their homeland under U.S.law, most are granted legal status, said Rivkind.   In 1980, nearly 125,000 Cubans entered South Florida in theMariel boatlift. Many of the newcomers were forced to camp underhighways and in vacant lots because few shelters were available.   The latest surge of Cuban refugees began only weeks after theCoast Guard responded to a record influx of Haitians traveling toSouth Florida shores in overcrowded boats.   In March, nearly 1,500 Haitians were stopped at sea, more thanany other month in an eight-year interdiction program which permitsthe Coast Guard to return Haitians to their homeland after INSinterviews at sea. So far this year, the Coast Guard has returnedmore than 2,600 Haitians.   Only five of the more than 20,000 Haitians interviewed at seasince 1981 have been brought into the country for political asylumhearings, the Coast Guard reports. The others were deemed economicrefugees and returned to Port-au-Prince.</TEXT></DOC>
