Cable Television Laboratories Inc. is expected to have an annualoperating budget of $7.5 million, the companies said.   Their announcement followed the National Cable TelevisionAssociation's three-day annual convention that ended here Tuesdayand an association board meeting Thursday.   ``This will allow us to develop our own technology moreeffectively and fully, and that will be good for consumers,'' whocan benefit from research to improve reliability, capacity andpicture quality of cable systems, said Trygve Myhren, chairman ofAmerican Television and Communications Corp., the nation'ssecond-largest cable company.   ``We want to make sure we're doing the best job for consumersand be competitive with others,'' he said.   Joining ATC in making an initial three-year financial commitmentto participate are Tele-Communications Inc., the largest U.S. cablecompany, No. 3 Continental Cablevision and Comcast CableCommunications, the seventh largest.   Combined, these companies operate cable systems with more than11 million subscribers, about a quarter of all the country's cablesubscribers.   Other cable companies are expected to join the effort, saidMyhren. Monthly dues will be 2 cents per subscriber.   The projected annual operating budget of $7.5 million is basedon anticipated contributions from cable systems serving a total ofabout 31 million subscribers, he said.   Cable Labs' early research will include how best to use highdefinition TV technologies and fiber optics, he said.   High definition TV, still in a development phase, is consideredthe next generation in television. HDTV delivers a clearer picturewith more brilliant color on a wider screen.   Fiber optics could significantly increase capacity of cablesystems and would help the cable industry compete with telephonecompanies if laws restricting phone company participation in thecable TV business were relaxed, as many in the cable industry fearthey might be.   Unlike most of the wire now used by phone and cable companies,fiber optic cable has capacity sufficient to bring voice, data andvideo into the home through a single wire.   ``Why can't that wire be our wire'' rather than the phonecompany's, Myhren said.</TEXT></DOC>
