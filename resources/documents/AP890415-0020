Meantime, U.S. federal charges were filed Friday against eightsuspects in the killings, including the man and woman alleged to bethe sect's masterminds.   Four men in custody in Matamoros will be charged formally underMexican law Monday, said Jose Piedad Silva Arroyo, Mexico's federalsupervisor for narcotics investigations in Matamoros.   Silva Arroyo said charges would include murder, drug offenses,kidnapping and weapons possession.   More than 60 people have visited El Rosario funeral home,searching for missing relatives.   ``From all over the country families have been coming here.They're still coming,'' said Hector Olvera Garcia, a funeral homeworker.   At Funerales Glayosso, another Matamoros funeral home, Maria delRosario Rivas Diaz of Monterrey, Mexico, identified the body of her23-year-old son, Ernesto. He had been missing since Feb. 14.   ``I think he suffered alive because they cut off his genitals,cut off his ears,'' Mrs. Rivas Diaz said. ``He doesn't have anyeyes. He doesn't have a nose. He doesn't have any hair. Then Ithink they killed him.''   She said she identified him mainly by a cross tattooed on hishand and by a missing front tooth. Ernesto's wife is three monthspregnant, said the grieving mother, who carried a picture of thecouple at their November wedding.   Twelve bodies were exhumed Tuesday and a 13th Thursday at theSanta Elena Ranch 20 miles west of this border city, followingconfessions from the four suspects. The suspects say 14 people werekilled.   Police said most of the cult's victims died either from blowsdealt with a machete or a hammer. Some suffered horriblemutilations, including the removal of brains, hearts and otherorgans that were boiled with blood in what suspects have describedas sacrificial rites of a cult seeking magical protection for theirdrug-smuggling activities.   Authorities said the gang smuggled a ton of marijuana weeklyinto the United States. The four suspects in custody, the twoalleged masterminds and two newly identified suspects were chargedby the U.S. federal government Friday with conspiracy and drugsmuggling and possession.   U.S. federal charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecutionwere filed against Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, nicknamed ``thegodfather,'' and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24, ``the godmother,''officials said. The two were believed to be at large in the UnitedStates.   Also at large were Olvidio Hernandez Rivera, 26; and Alvaro deLeon, in his early 20s.   From her home in Miami, Delia Del Valle, Constanzo's mother,told a Dallas television station through a translator Friday nightshe is scared and confused in the wake of the slayings. But shesaid she doesn't believe her son will call her because he wouldn'twant law enforcement officials to hound her.   ``I can't believe it. He's my son,'' she said. ``I raised him. Iheld him in my arms. He's always been beside me. He's not the kindof son to disappear.''   The body of Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of Texasstudent, was returned to the United States on Thursday, officialssaid. His family returned to their hometown, Santa Fe, where afuneral mass is planned for today.
