The potential purchase by the Taiwanese concern, formedlast summer as a joint venture between private-sectorconglomorates and government agencies, may be just the firstpiece of a larger U.S.-Asian consortium McDonnell Douglas istrying to form. Industry officials say entities in Singapore,South Korea and Japan may also ultimately buy stakes inMcDonnell Douglas's airliner business, conceivably totalingas much as 49% including the Taiwanese stake.</LP><TEXT>   How much of a manufacturing role Taiwan or any of theother countries might play is unclear. But McDonnell Douglashas signaled its intention to become the industry's low-costproducer, and that presumably would involve moving some partsof the aircraft-production process overseas.   In July, Taiwan Aerospace quietly agreed to join McDonnellDouglas in exploring the possibility of the Taiwanesebuilding aircraft parts. At this point, though, TaiwanAerospace doesn't manufacture anything.   Officials of Taiwan Aerospace couldn't be reached forcomment. A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglasdeclined comment on any of the talks it is holding, except tostress that nothing has been signed at this point.   He added that if a deal or series of transactionseventually does take place, McDonnell Douglas will be sure tomaintain majority control of its jetliner business.   McDonnell Douglas, widely viewed as the weakest of theworld's Big Three airliner makers, has been openly searchingfor foreign investors for months, principally in Asia. LateTuesday, the company announced that among its currentdiscussions &quot;is one involving a potential equity investmentby third-party investors&quot; in as much as 40% of the commercialtransport business.   Yesterday, reflecting that news, McDonnell Douglas shareswere quoted at $79.125, up $2.125, in late New York StockExchange trading. On Tuesday, the company's stock climbed$4.625, after Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. issued a report saying themajor equity deal being discussed would boost companyearnings and reduce its debt.   But a sizable acquisition by Taiwan Aerospace would alsoraise a host of sticky questions for McDonnell Douglas, whichhas been counting on a huge cash infusion to help fund itsnew MD-12 wide-body jetliner. Some politicians would be sureto question whether the U.S. is giving too much away in arare area where it has a clear technological edge. Theaerospace industry has for years been America's leadingindustrial exporter.   And the United Auto Workers and Machinists unions, whichin the past have expressed concerns about jobs lost toheightened foreign competition, are likely to raise an uproaras well.   Moreover, an alliance with Taiwan could complicateMcDonnell Douglas's relationship with China, Taipei'slongtime adversary. The Chinese already build McDonnellDouglas's MD-80 airliner under license, and they haveexpressed an interest in producing the follow-up MD-90 and asmaller passenger plane called the MD-95.   But, for all these dangers, McDonnell Douglas may have nochoice but to try something bold.   Without significant foreign investment, the company hasn'tthe wherewithal to go beyond serving a relatively smallsegment of the airliner market with it two current nicheproducts, the MD-80 and MD-11. With Boeing Co. maintaining acommanding 60% market share and the European consortiumAirbus Industrie luring business away from McDonnell Douglasover the past few years, some analysts believe the companycould one day be driven out of the airliner industryaltogether.   The company is clearly hoping a strong link to Asia willprove its savior. Besides providing low-cost suppliers, thePacific Rim is expected to absorb more new jetliners in thenext 15 years than most any other part of the world. Whilejet buying in the U.S. and Europe has slowed during therecession, Asian carriers continue to fill the order books. AMcDonnell Douglas study released last month said that by2010, airline passenger traffic in the Asia-Pacific regionwill roughly equal that of the U.S.   For the Taiwanese, meanwhile, a union with McDonnellDouglas would give a much needed boost to its embryonicaircraft industry. One official familiar with TaiwanAerospace said the company has had difficulty in raisingcapital that was promised from the private sector.Consequently, the government's interest has been raisedsubstantially from the original 30%. In late June, TaiwanAerospace announced that three government bodies were slatedto contribute 45.4% of the company's paid-in capital. Inaddition, Central Investment Holding Co., the main investmentarm of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang Party, was expected to takea 10% take.   ---   Jeremy Mark contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
