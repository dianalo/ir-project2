<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-49-0362 </DOCNO><TEXT>An evaluation was made of possible hazardous working conditions duringthe manufacture of thermoset microwave cookware and custom-molded plasticparts. Particular attention was given to exposure to styrene in the CompoundingDepartment. In the department the primary constituents of the plasticswere weighed, mixed, blended, extruded, and placed in crates for transportto the Pressing Department. The highest personal time-weighted averageexposures were analyzed and indicated a mean exposure level of 44.6 partsper million (ppm). There were exposure levels for each of the three extruderoperators which exceeded the 50.0ppm NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit.Short term personal exposures in the Compounding Department ranged from26.6 to 39.1ppm. Total dust exposures ranged from 1.0 to 12.3mg/m{sup3} throughout the facility. Personal samples in the Compounding Departmentshowed exposures at 12.3mg/m{sup 3}. The authors conclude that a healthhazard existed from styrene and nuisance-dust exposures. They recommendchanges in the ventilation system, installation of local exhaust ventilationat the extruder operations, and enclosure of the preweigh station.</TEXT></DOC>
