New population estimates for the nation's metropolitan areas showfew changes among the top 25 urban areas, with New York still firmlyin first place, followed by Los Angeles and Chicago.   The biggest move among the 25 largest communities was by SanDiego, which rose from 19th in 1987 to 17th last year. It added84,100 people, climbing to 2,370,400 metro-area residents.   That pushed the Southern California city past Baltimore andPittsburgh. Baltimore was listed with 2,342,500 residents, up 31,900from the year before, and Pittsburgh declined 7,900, to 2,284,100.   Not far down the list, fast-growing Phoenix pushed past theburgeoning Tampa-St. Petersburg region.   Phoenix added 51,500 residents over the year to climb to2,029,500 and rise one spot to the nation's 20th largest metro area.Tampa-St. Petersburg dropped to 21st, despite a gain of 38,000people for a 1988 total of 1,995,100.   While revised 1987 figures contained in the new report indicatethat Phoenix actually moved ahead of Tampa-St. Petersburg in thatyear, the Florida metropolitan area had been listed as the larger ofthe two on the basis of preliminary 1987 estimates.   The Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., metro area edged upone spot to 24th, passing Milwaukee-Racine, which fell to 25th.   The calculations are for metropolitan areas, which are officiallydefined by the federal Office of Management and Budget. Theseregional designations are used for federal statistical purposes.Generally they consist of central cities of at least 50,000 peopleand the surrounding regions that are economically interrelated.
