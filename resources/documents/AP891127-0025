President Alfredo Cristiani made the announcement in a televisedaddress Sunday, a day after military authorities said theydiscovered two light planes in El Salvador that were deliveringshoulder-fired missiles to the rebels.   Nicaragua denied involvement and suggested such an accusationcould endanger regional peace.   The Nicaraguan president, Daniel Ortega, said it gave his people``honor and pride'' that a government ``of assassins of priests andreligious workers'' broke relations.   He urged other countries to break ties with El Salvador'sU.S.-backed government until it has ``punished the assassins.''   Ortega's was an apparent reference to the Nov. 16 massacre in ElSalvador of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughterat a university. Other Jesuits at the school say witnesses saw armytroops enter the residence before the killings.   Cristiani has ordered an investigation into allegations themilitary was involved. The murders occurred in the heat of a rebeloffensive that turned the capital into a combat zone and was thelargest of the decade-old civil war.   The government has accused church leaders of sympathizing with _and even aiding _ the rebels. On Sunday, authorities arrested anAmerican church worker and accused her of storing weapons.   One of the planes that allegedly carried weapons from Nicaraguacrashed Saturday in eastern El Salvador and troops recovered mostlySoviet weapons, including 25 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.   Three crewmen died, and the fourth committed suicide,authorities said.   The other plane apparently had its cargo unloaded after landingin the southern part of the country and was torched by the crew,who fled. Photographers for U.S. news organizations who saw itSunday said trenches dug near the plane were filled with burneddebris.   The three photographers were detained briefly Sunday forentering the area without government permission.   Cristiani told a news conference that relations with Nicaragua'sleftist Sandinista government would remain suspended until Ortega``stops intervening in El Salvador'' or loses in national electionsFeb. 25.   In a statement issued in Managua, the Nicaraguan governmentdenied any connection with the two planes.   It quoted Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto as saying: ``TheSalvadoran government should think about the seriousness of thedeclarations and actions that the news media are attributing tothem, and about the serious implications in the regional peaceprocess.''   Ortega, Cristiani and three other Central American presidents inAugust signed agreements in Tela, Honduras, to demobilize theNicaraguan Contra rebels by Dec. 5 and pledged to ban all aid toinsurgents.   Missiles and other weapons said to have been taken from thewreckage of the plane that crashed were displayed at Cristiani'snews conference. Introduction of such missiles into the war by therebels would threaten a key government advantage, control of theair.   As Cristiani spoke, sounds of renewed fighting _ automaticweapons and exploding rockets _ could be heard after a pause ofseveral days.   Later, the military said in a statement that an army patrol hadsighted a group of guerrillas near a power transformer on thenorthwest edge of the capital and helicopters and C-47 warplaneschased them as they fled up the slopes of San Salvador Volcano.   The aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for several hours.   The arrested American was identified as Jennifer Jean Casolo, ofThomaston, Conn. She is a representative of Christian EducationalSeminar, a San Antonio-based ecumenical group.   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, an armed forces spokesman, said40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made M-16 rifles, 40,000rounds of of ammunition for Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles, 203blocks of TNT and 403 detonator-caps were found at Ms. Casolo'shouse during a 2 a.m. raid and at other locations he did notspecify.   Chavez said the arms cache ``proves church involvement'' withthe rebels. He did not elaborate.   John Blatz, a spokesman for the Christian Educational Seminar,said by telephone that Ms. Casolo has been in El Salvador since1985. He called the accusations ``ridiculous'' and ``part of their(the government's) persecution of the churches. That's clear.''   More than a dozen churches and refugee centers have been raidedby security forces since the rebels launched their offensive Nov.11.</TEXT></DOC>
