The drug, called anistreplase, is the third clot-dissolving drugto be approved.   Its advantage is that it can be administered in five minutes orless while the other two must be administered continuously for oneto three hours, according to SmithKline Beecham, which will marketthe drug as Eminase.   Although clot-dissolving drugs can open blocked arteries andlimit damage from heart attacks, they are used in only 20 percentor so of the estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients who couldbenefit from treatment each year, according to the Department ofHealth and Human Services, which includes the FDA.   More than 300,000 of the 1.5 million people who suffer heartattacks each year die before getting to the hospital and anadditional 300,000 get there too late for treatment withclot-dissolving drugs, the department said in announcing the FDAaction.   ``Ease and convenience of administration of anistreplasehopefully will lead to greater use of this life-saving thrombolytictherapy even in emergency rooms and small hospitals not equippedwith sophisticated coronary care facilities,'' said HHS SecretaryLouis Sullivan.   A blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is themost common cause of heart attacks. The clot prevents blood fromcarrying oxygen to the heart muscle, which can lead to heartfailure and death.   The other two approved clot-dissolving drugs are alteplase, orTPA, and streptokinase.</TEXT></DOC>
