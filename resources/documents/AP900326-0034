Tommy Thompson planned to sign afirst-of-its-kind bill that would let 1,000 low-income Milwaukeestudents use public education funds to enroll in private schools.   Under the plan, the state would pay up to $2,500 _ theper-capita state education allotment _ for full tuition innon-sectarian private schools for each student who chooses to leavethe public-school system next fall.   The amount spent would be subtracted from the budget for thecity's public schools, which have nearly 100,000 students.   The Legislature sent the bill to the governor on Thursday.   At the Bush administration's invitation, the bill's sponsor,state Rep. Annette ``Polly'' Williams, D-Milwaukee, has spent thepast few months traveling around the country to tout the plan as amodel for school choice.   ``Money talks,'' Ms. Williams said. ``For the first time, poorpeople will get respect because they can take their $2,500 to aschool of their choice and say, `I want my children educated.'''   Thompson, a Republican, has hailed the school-choice bill andsaid he plans to sign it soon.   ``We as a state have acknowledged that private schools play animportant role and provide an effective option in the education ofour children,'' Thompson said Thursday.   But Robert Peterkin, superintendent of Milwaukee schools andsupporter of some kinds of school choice, said the bill theLegislature passed is ``a threat to education.''   The bill, he said, could upset the city schools' racialdesegregation plan. He also complained it would drain resourcesfrom inner-city schools and do nothing to improve schools that losestudents.   ``The concept that the competitive marketplace will magicallymake the public-school system improve is simplistic,'' Peterkinsaid. He had no immediate plans to challenge it in court, however.   The state's largest teachers union, the Wisconsin EducationAssociation Council, initially also opposed the proposal. But theunion changed its position when the governor promised not to usehis partial veto power to expand the program, said Thomas Fonfara,Thompson's education advisor.   Fonfara said the union's decision was the key to winninglegislative support for the plan.</TEXT></DOC>
