The Cray 3,which is still on the drawing boards and is based on unproven chiptechnology, could reach speeds of 16 billion calculations per second.   Cray is the world's biggest maker of supercomputers, which areused for high-powered scientific and engineering work. Its rivalsinclude Control Data Corp. and Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd.
