Availabledata demonstrating such health effects was reviewed and evidence supportingthe technical feasibility of reducing the current Mine Safety and HealthAdministration (MSHA) standard was presented. Five recent studies indicateda significant increase in lung cancer rates associated with radon progenyexposure in underground mines. Additional studies indicated an exposure/responserelationship in uranium miners. The influence of smoking on the associationbetween radon progeny exposure and lung cancer was cited. Evidence hasindicated that exposure to radon progeny carries a potential risk ofdeveloping occupationally induced lung cancer. Risk-assessment data supportedthe conclusion that miners with the same characteristics as the UnitedStates Public Health Service uranium miners cohort and who accrue a cumulativeoccupational exposure of 120 working level months, would have a lungcancer excess lifetime risk of about 35 to 40 lung cancer deaths per1000 exposed miners. Modern mining methods using dilution ventilationas well as bulkheading and backfilling techniques make it possible toachieve substantial reductions in the cumulative exposure to radon progeny.Information was provided on sampling strategy, control technology, ventilationsystems, respirators, and medical surveillance programs.</TEXT></DOC>
