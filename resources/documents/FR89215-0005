Section 313 establishes a Rural Economic DevelopmentSubaccount and authorizes the Administrator of REA to utilize funds inthis subaccount to provide zero interest loans or grants to RE Act borrowersfor the purpose of promoting rural economic development and job creationprojects.On April 7, 1988, REA published an advance notice of proposed rulemakingin an effort to obtain public comments on all aspects of this new program.REA received a total of 54 written comments. These comments were takeninto account in preparing the proposed rule.On October 27, 1988, REA published a proposed rule at 53 FR 43442 to amend7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding a new Part 1709, Rural Development, and addingSubpart B, Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program.

Thirty-fourorganizations comprised of REA borrowers, electric and telephone utilitytrade organizations, cooperative banks, economic development organizationsand state governments supported the new program. One gas company and oneelectric and gas investor-owned utility expressed adamant opposition tothe new program. An additional three investor-owned electric utilitiessuggested modifications in the program.Most of the organizations made specific comments on the proposed rule.These comments will be addressed in the following paragraphs by first discussingREA's modifications to the proposed rule and then discussing the remainingsuggested modifications. REA considered all comments in preparing the finalrule.REA received numerous comments on the section of the proposed rule whichdiscussed the eligibility of a borrower that is not current on its RE Actfinancing or is in bankruptcy proceedings. There were comments both supportingand opposing the eligibility section. The organizations opposed to thissection felt that areas served by borrowers that would not be eligibleunder this section of the proposed rule could benefit from rural economicdevelopment under this program. They suggested that REA consider whetherthe borrower is working in good faith with REA on repayment matters. Currentfederal policy, as set forth in OMB Circular A-129, Managing Federal CreditPrograms, dated November 25, 1988, restricts further financial assistanceto applicants who are delinquent on a Federal debt. Therefore, REA is retainingthe section in the rule on the eligibility of borrowers with some modifications.REA would like to point out that if one distribution borrower of a generatingand transmission system is ineligible for funds under this program thatdoes not mean the generating and transmission system itself or the otherdistribution members are ineligible. In addition to the eligibility section,REA has also added under paragraph (m) of andSection; 1709.17, Selectionof recipients of zero interest loans and grants, a consideration of theBorrower's management and financial situation which will be important tothe success of the program.Two organizations suggested that the rule should contain the statutoryrequirement that REA use the full amount of funds in the Subaccount eachyear to make zero interest loans or grants. REA has added andSection; 1709.15,Disposition of funds in the Subaccount, which addresses the annual dispositionof funds. For administrative purposes, REA must make a determination ofthe amount held in the Subaccount as of some date prior to the end of thefiscal year. REA would not be able to use funds repaid into or creditedto the Subaccount a few days before the end of the fiscal year in thatsame fiscal year.Many organizations commented on the selection factors listed in the proposedrule. REA has made additions to several of the factors based on these comments.Several organizations suggested that REA take into account the outmigrationof people and also the underemployment of people in part-time jobs or jobsbelow their skill level. REA will take these into account when lookingat employment levels to the extent the borrower provides satisfactory dataon a local basis in the preapplication. There was also a suggestion thatREA look at other personal income measurements. As with underemploymentand outmigration, REA will also consider other personal income measurementsto the extent the borrower provides satisfactory data on a local basisin the preapplication. Several organizations recommended that REA considerthe size and nature of the community while considering the number of jobscreated to the amount of funds requested. REA has modified this factorto take into account the impact of the number of jobs created on the ruralcommunity. One organization suggested that REA consider whether a projectwill assist a rural community to diversify its economic base. REA has agreedto include this in the list of factors.Several organizations discussed the size of zero interest loans and grants.One organization suggested that a maximum size should be established dueto the limited amount of funds available under this program. REA agreesthat given the limited amount of funds available to borrowers under thisprogram and in order to provide funds to more projects it will modify therule to establish the maximum size of a zero interest loan or grant at$100,000.Several organizations discussed the preapplication periods REA establishedand suggested that REA increase the number per year. REA has modified therule to provide for six preapplication periods during the year. This shouldprovide a faster turnaround time on requests for funds while retaininga mechanism to provide equitable consideration of all preapplications.Many organizations discussed whether REA should take into consideration,along with other factors, the borrower's commitment to generating fundsfor this program through cushion of credit payments. Some organizationswere in favor of this consideration; one organization even suggested thatREA establish a strong preference for those borrowers making cushion ofcredit payments. Other organizations believed that this consideration shouldbe deleted since borrowers serving rural areas that could benefit fromeconomic development might not have the same level of funds available tomake cushion of credit payments as other borrowers in more prosperous areas.After considering both arguments, REA has decided that the language inthe proposed rule which provides for the Administrator to take into considerationborrowers' cushion of credit payments is appropriate.One organization believed that the rule should provide for case-by-casediscretion to handle a few projects that might require a longer loan repaymentperiod than ten years. The first sentence of the section of the proposedrule outlining the terms of zero interest loans establishes REA's discretionon determining the repayment terms. The Administrator may determine underthe language of the proposed rule that in certain situations a longer repaymentterm is necessary for the success of the project.REA mentioned in the notice of proposed rulemaking that it had consideredincluding an objective ranking procedure based on assigning a given numberof points for each of the selection factors. Four organizations recommendedthat REA establish a ranking procedure in the rule. After further considerationof this issue, REA has decided to leave the proposed language unchanged.The selection of projects will rest within the discretion of the Administrator.REA needs the latitude to develop its method of evaluating rural economicdevelopment projects as it gains experience. The rule as written providesREA the needed latitude while providing a list of selection factors theAdministrator will consider to guide borrowers applying for loan or grantfunds.Several investor-owned electric utilities that compete with REA electricborrowers for business in the same service area were concerned about REAborrowers using the funds under this program to offer rate incentives oronly submitting preapplications for projects that agreed to take theirservice. REA deliberately did not set forth language dealing with whetherthe project was in the REA borrower's service territory or whether it wouldtake service from the REA borrower. The rule was written to encourage economicdevelopment in rural areas without regard to service territory. The Administratorwill use his discretion to select projects that meet this objective andREA does not believe written requirements are necessary. Additionally,REA cannot, as some investor-owned electric utilities have suggested, providefunds directly to the economic development project and bypass the REA borrower.The law provides for funds to go to the REA borrowers who in turn willpromote rural economic development.Finally, REA received two comments, one from a gas company and anotherfrom an investor-owned electric and gas utility, that expressed adamantopposition to the law establishing the zero interest loan and grant program.The gas company did not believe that the REA program should be expandedwhile the nation has a budget deficit. It believes private industry coulddo the job of providing financing for utilities. The gas company does notbelieve its competitors, the REA electric borrowers, should receive subsidizedGovernment funds. It also believes many REA borrowers are wealthy enoughto go to the private markets.The investor-owned electric and gas utility believes that utilizing theREA borrowers to disburse rural economic development funds will potentiallyresult in an unfair, inequitable and ineffective distribution of funds.It suggests that the state governments disburse the funds. The utilityalso believes that the REA borrowers receive preferential tax and loaninterest rate treatment. It suggested that the rule restrict funds to REAborrowers serving rural areas. REA believes the proposed rule was veryclear that the program is to promote economic development in rural areas.Despite the two organizations' objections, REA must implement this programsince it was established by law.On August 11, 1986, REA published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 28722) with the number 7 CFR Part 1709entitled Primary Support Documents. In accordance with REA's newly developedplan to number parts 7 CFR Part 1700, that proposed rule remains a proposedrule that will be redesignated 7 CFR Part 1716, Subpart A_Power RequirementsStudies. The text of that proposed rule remains unaltered by this changein number.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1709</ITAG>Rural development.In view of the above, REA hereby amends 7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding thefollowing new Part 1709 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1709_RURAL DEVELOPMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.1-1709.9 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.10 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.11 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.12 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.13 Source of funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.14 Eligibility</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.15 Disposition of funds in the Subaccount.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.16 Purposes of zero interest loans and grants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.17 Selection of recipients of zero interest loans and grants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.18 Preference for zero interest loans over grants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.19 Limitation on use of zero interest loan and grant funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.20 Size of zero interest loans and grants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.21 Terms of zero interest loan repayment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.22 Agreements and security for funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.23 Transfer of employment or business.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.24 Environmental requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.25 Other considerations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.26 Preapplications and applications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.27 Application processing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.28 Zero interest loan and grant approval.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.29 Disbursement of zero interest loan and grant funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1709.30 Review and other requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 7 U.S.C. 901 <T3>et seq</T3>.; Title I, Subtitle D, Section 1403, Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987, Pub.
