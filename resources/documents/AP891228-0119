(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man paid a college student to kill himby running him down with a car, police said Thursday.   Graham Glickfeld, who was killed over the weekend, had madesimilar requests before, but it was not clear why he wanted to die,said police spokesman Dennis Satariano. ``But this was obviously aman with some emotional problems,'' he said.   The driver, Michael K. Doeschot, 27, a student at San Jose StateUniversity, was arraigned Wednesday on murder charges and heldwithout bail.   ``It was murder for hire,'' said Sgt. Mike Eads.   Police would not say how much money was involved, only that itwas not a lot, and would not give details of the earlier offers bythe victim.   The two men attended a Christmas party separately Friday night,police said.   Police responding to a call around midnight found Glickfeld, a31-year-old supermarket worker, seriously injured in the emptyparking lot of a community center. He died a short time later at ahospital.   The arrangement between the two men ``probably took place withina couple hours,'' said Eads.   After the car hit Glickfeld, Doeschot ``called police to let usknow what's going on,'' Eads said. ``We had some idea it was anintentional act from the beginning.'' Doeschot admitted runningover Glickfeld, the sergeant said.   Detective Ken Bingaman said the men were acquaintances from atheater class at a community college.</TEXT></DOC>
