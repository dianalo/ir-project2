Prior to Pub. L. 100-203, the tax was imposed onthe following occupations under ATF's jurisdiction: Wholesale and retaildealers in liquor (spirits, wine, and/or beer), wholesale and retail dealersin beer only, limited retail dealers, brewers, manufacturers of nonbeverageproducts (MNBP), and importers, manufacturers and dealers in NFA firearms(including importers, manufacturers and dealers in weapons classified as``any other weapon''). Public Law 100-203 increased the special tax ratesfor most proprietors who currently pay special tax, and imposed new specialtaxes on proprietors under ATF's jurisdiction who do not currently haveto pay special tax. The new law repealed the special (occupational) taxformerly imposed upon limited retail dealers. The term ``limited retaildealer,'' which is defined in 26 U.S.C. 5122(c), refers to persons whosell alcoholic beverages at events of limited duration, such as lodge picnics,county fairs, etc.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Occupational Taxes</ITAG>Special (occupational) taxes have been imposed for the first time on theoccupations shown in the following chart. These new taxes apply equallyto Federal, State, and local government agencies and instrumentalitiesengaged in any of the taxable activities.

To qualify for the reduced rate, a proprietormust have gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year) of less than$500,000. ``Taxable year'' in this context refers to the taxpayer's incometax year, not the special (occupational) tax year. The term ``gross receipts''means all of the taxpayer's gross receipts_not just those derived fromthe business subject to special tax. Gross receipts are reduced by returnsand allowances made during the taxable year, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualizedby multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividingthe result by the number of months in the short period, as required by26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) (pertainingto ``controlled groups'') shall be treated as one taxpayer for purposesof determining eligibility for the reduced rate of tax. Proprietors ofnew businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietorsof existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commencea new activity subject to special tax, are eligible for the reduced taxrate unless the business is a member of a ``controlled group.'' Completerules for determining eligibility for the reduced special (occupational)tax rate are contained in the regulations prescribed by this Treasury decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Filing of Return and Payment of Special Tax</ITAG>Every person who engages in a business subject to special (occupational)tax is required to file a special tax return, ATF Form 5630.5, with paymentof tax, before commencing operations. Form 5630.5 shall be completed inaccordance with the instructions on the form and shall be mailed, alongwith remittance, to the address indicated on the form. Thereafter, thetaxpayer will receive a bill on Form 5630.5 prior to the first day of Julyin each year. The bill will contain certain preprinted information. Thetaxpayer shall complete and sign the Form 5630.5 in accordance with theinstructions on the form and mail the form, along with remittance, to theaddress indicated on the form. If the taxpayer does not receive a renewalnotice on ATF Form 5630.5 before the tax is due, the taxpayer shall obtaina blank ATF Form 5630.5 from any ATF office and complete the form in accordancewith the instructions on the form. The taxpayer shall then mail the completedtax return form, with remittance, to the address indicated on the form.Special (occupational) taxes are normally prorated for new proprietorswho commence operations after July 1 of the tax year. The only exceptionsare manufacturers, importers, and dealers in NFA firearms, and manufacturersof nonbeverage products. Those proprietors must pay the full annual specialtax for the tax year during which they commence operations. For all others,the initial tax is computed from the first day of the month in which liabilityis incurred until the 30th day of June following. Tax in subsequent yearsis computed for the entire tax year (July 1 through June 30). Completeprocedures for the preparation and filing of special tax returns and thepayment of the tax are prescribed in the regulations amended by this finalrule.Any person required by law to file a return and pay tax who fails to filethe return and pay tax on or before the last day prescribed shall pay,as an addition to the tax, a penalty for both failure to file a returnand for failure to pay the tax. In addition, interest is due on unpaidspecial tax from the date the tax was required to be paid to the date paid.Interest shall be charged for each day at the rate prescribed by law ineffect on that day. For more information concerning the computation ofpenalties and interest, refer to Subpart E of 27 CFR Part 70 and SubpartH of 27 CFR Part 194.<ITAG tagnum="84">Transition Rule</ITAG>The new regulations on special (occupational) tax take effect on January1, 1988. However, taxpayers who were in business on that date will nothave to file a tax return and pay the increased or new tax until April1, 1988. Thereafter, the tax return must be filed and the tax paid on orbefore July 1 of each year.For purposes of determining the amount of increased or new occupationaltax due on April 1, 1988, under this transition rule, any person engagedon January 1, 1988, in any trade or business subject to such a tax shallbe treated as having first engaged in the taxable trade or business onthat date. If the taxpayer previously paid an occupational tax in respectof any premises for taxable period which began before January 1, 1988,and includes that date, the increased occupational tax imposed by thistransition rule in respect of those premises shall not exceed one-halfthe excess (if any) of_(a) The annual rate of occupational tax in effect on January 1, 1988, over(b) The annual rate of such tax in effect on December 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Filing of Return and Payment of Special Tax During Transition Period</ITAG>During the period between January 1, 1988, and April 1, 1988, taxpayersof record will be sent a bill on one of three supplemental forms. If thetaxpayer owed but did not pay special tax for the current tax year, thenthe taxpayer will be sent ATF Form 5630.5 Supplemental 1 to cover the delinquenttax due plus the tax for the transition period between January 1, 1988,and June 30, 1988. If the taxpayer paid special tax for the current year,the taxpayer will be sent ATF Form 5630.5 Supplemental 2 to cover the increasedtax for the transition period between January 1, 1988, and June 30, 1988.If the taxpayer was not previously required to pay special tax but is nowrequired to pay special tax due to the change in the law, the taxpayerwill be sent AFT Form 5630.5 Supplemental 3 to cover the tax for the transitionperiod between January 1, 1988, and June 30, 1988.Taxpayers who receive either ATF Form 5630.5 Supplemental 1, 2, or 3 shallfill out the form in accordance with the instructions on the form and shallmail the form, with remittance of tax, on or before April 1, 1988, to theaddress indicated on the form. If a taxpayer does not receive a bill onATF Form 5630.5 Supplemental 1, 2, or 3, he or she is still required tofile a tax return and pay the tax on or before April 1, 1988, in accordancewith the transition rule described earlier in this preamble. Tax returnsmay be obtained by contacting any ATF office. The taxpayer shall then mailthe return, with remittance, to the address indicated on the form.<ITAG tagnum="84">Examples of Transition Rule</ITAG>Example 1A wholesale beer dealer is in business as of January 1, 1988, and has previouslypaid special tax at the rate of $123 a year for the period July 1, 1987,through June 30, 1988. This dealer would become liable for the additionaltax on January 1, 1988, but would not have to file the tax return or paythe additional tax until April 1, 1988. The tax would cover the periodfrom January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1988. The tax would be computedas one-half the difference between the new tax rate and the old tax rate.This computation would be as follows: \1/2\($500^$123)=\1/2\($377)=$188.50.Example 2A proprietor of a distilled spirits plant is in business as of January1, 1988. Previous law and regulations did not require such proprietorsto pay special (occupational) taxes so none was paid. The distilled spiritsplant proprietor would become liable for the new tax on January 1, 1988,but would not be required to file the tax return or pay the new tax untilApril 1, 1988. The tax would cover the period from January 1, 1988, throughJune 30, 1988. The tax would be computed as one-half the difference betweenthe new tax rate and the old tax rate. This computation would be as follows:\1/2\($1000^$0)=\1/2\($1000)=$500.If the gross receipts of the distilled spirits plant proprietor (for themost recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable periodto which the special (occupational) tax relates) are less than $500,000,then the proprietor would qualify for the reduced rate of $500 per year.In this example, such a small proprietor would only be required to payone-half the reduced rate. Therefore, the proprietor would pay $250 onor before April 1, 1988.  Example 3  A manufacturer of NFA firearms began business on December 15, 1987. Sincespecial tax for this proprietor is not prorated, the proprietor filed atax return and paid tax in the amount of $500 for the period covering December15, 1987 through June 30, 1988. The proprietor would become liable forthe additional tax on January 1, 1988, but would not have to file the taxreturn or pay the additional tax until April 1, 1988. The tax would coverthe period from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1988. The tax would becomputed as one-half the difference between the new tax rate and the oldtax rate. This computation would be as follows: \1/2\($1000 ^$500)=\1/2\($500)=$250. If this manufacturer had gross receipts of less than $500,000 and thusqualified for the reduced rate as a small proprietor, the tax owed in thisexample would be \1/2\($500 ^ $500) which would be zero. In this case,the proprietor should file a tax return but would show zero balance due. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act  </ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatoryflexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rulebecause the agency was not required to publish a general notice of proposedrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291  </ITAG>In compliance with Executive Order 12291, ATF has determined that thisfinal rule is not a ``major rule,'' because the economic effects flow directlyfrom the underlying statute and not from this final rule. Therefore, itis found that this final rule will not result in:  (a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;  (b) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (c) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act  </ITAG>The requirement to file a special (occupational) tax return has been previouslyapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 1512-0472.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Procedure Act  </ITAG>Because this final rule merely implements a law which has increased special(occupational) taxes and imposed new special (occupational) taxes on alcohol,tobacco and NFA firearms proprietors, and because immediate guidance isnecessary to implement the new and increased tax rates, it is found tobe unnecessary and impracticable to issue this Treasury decision with noticeand public procedure thereon under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) or subject to the effectivedate limitation of 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information  </ITAG>The principal authors of this document are Robert White and Steve Simonof the Wine
