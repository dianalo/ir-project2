With this method, the drug can be repeatedly applied and the reproducibilityof imaged findings is secured. It is possible to accurately judge theeffect by the use of a local anesthetics before the injection of theneurolytics. Imaged findings at the celiac plexus block were classifiedinto 4 types according to the pattern of CT images. Paticularly interestingis a finding that the contrast media injected in the retrocrural spacefor retrocrural splanchnic nerve block (RSB) permeates through the aortichiatus as far as the area surrounding the celiac plexus and so-calledtranscrural celiac plexus block (TCB) takes place. Thus, it was foundthat the celiac plexus block so far used was a complex of RSB and TCB.</TEXT></DOC>
