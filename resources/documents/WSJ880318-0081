Late yesterday afternoon, the Screen Actors Guild and the Federation of Television and Radio Artists rejected a request by an ad agency-advertiser group to meet again to discuss their contract dispute. No more talks are scheduled before the walkout is to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST Monday.    A strike won't affect regular TV programs, but TV production is already beginning to suffer from a strike by the 9,000-member Writers Guild of America, which began March 7.    Meanwhile, the other two unions are battling the Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies over two primary issues: payments from commercials on cable TV, and preservation of automatic cost-of-living adjustments, which the advertisers would like removed.    In anticipation of the strike, ad executives have been working feverishly to finish projects by today. Some advertisers are postponing future commercials. But most are searching for non-union talent, and preparing to rewrite commercials in case the amateurs aren't up to, say, handling dialogue.    Many advertisers insist ads with non-union actors will look just the same to TV viewers. But Bob Nelson, executive producer for ad agency Levine, Huntley, Schmidt andamp; Beaver Inc., disagrees. &quot;Nine years ago, during the last strike, there was a vast difference,&quot; he said. He recalled a Stroh's beer ad he produced at the time: It only showed beer mugs and hands, he said, because it was &quot;too hard to find somebody that could talk and look presentable&quot; at the same time.    Already, advertisers have sunk enormous amounts of time and money into finding suitable amateur talent. For the past two weeks, most have double-cast their commercials with both union and nonunion actors, just to be safe. &quot;You go to churches and schools, you just pull them off the street if they look right,&quot; says Dick Hall of Griner-Cuesta andamp; Associates, a TV production firm. &quot;Word gets out to pseudo-actors, people who have performed in the local summer stock or the PTA. Unfortunately, they can't usually act.&quot;    Steve Horn Productions Inc., which is working on a Reebok sneakers commercial, posted audition signs at an outdoor basketball court in the heart of New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood. Della Femina, Travisano andamp; Partners, an advertising agency, is scouring Miami beaches, as well as New York and Los Angeles, for talent for a Coppertone commercial. Desperate agents casting other commercials have reached &quot;even my child,&quot; said Linda Tesa, Della Femina's broadcast director. &quot;Two casting agents came to his school because they needed 10-year-old boys.&quot;    Some agencies simply are cutting out acting parts in ads, and many others say they will have to do the same if the anticipated strike lasts a month or more. Ad agency HBM/Creamer Inc. in Boston, for example, is filming a commercial -- created partly because of the expected walkout -- that uses fingers rather than whole actors. Jack Curtis, director of broadcast operations, said, &quot;It's a lot easier to find fingers.&quot; McCann-Erickson Inc., an advertising agency in New York, is preparing similar alternative campaigns to use if the strike lasts long, said Carole Cohan, director of broadcast operations.    But many advertisers' postponement of commercials can prove financially painful for independent commercial producers. A major client of Travisano/DiGiacomo Films has postponed filming a $340,000, two-commercial package in anticipation of a strike. &quot;I'm feeling it in a real big way,&quot; said Ron Travisano, a principal of the production company. &quot;The last two weeks I should have been doing that (project), and if I don't shoot, I lose. I still have to pay my overhead.&quot;    McCann's Ms. Cohan said some of the six to 10 commercials the agency had planned for the next few weeks may be postponed until after the expected strike. Della Femina's Ms. Tesa said she has put off two campaigns until May, when she hopes the strike, if it occurs, will be over. And Phil Suarez, of Giraldi-Suarez Productions Inc., said &quot;the flow of boards (scripts) has been less.&quot; He explained, &quot;A lot of clients are waiting in the wings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
