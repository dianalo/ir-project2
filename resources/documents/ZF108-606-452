 During the period before the machine's official announcementin October 1988, we believe Next received more attention (including hype,rumors, and leaked information) than any other non-available computer productin the history of personal computing.andM;The publicity continued when the computer finally became available.andP;  Whenintroduced, the Next system contained a number of features not found oncompetitive products, including a new graphical-user interface, an erasableoptical drive, and a standard digital-signal-processing (DSP) chip.andP;  WhileNext seems to have backed away from pushing some of the unique features ofthe system, other &quot;firsts&quot; on the Next Computer are likely to be, or havealready been, adopted by other system manufacturers.andP;  However, the ultimatesuccess or failure of Next Inc. lies neither in Jobs' high profile nor in therevolutionary features of the box, but rather in how the Next system performsfor its users.andM;Judging from its list of hardware specifications the Next system looks like aworkstation, but it is marketed more as an appliance computer that justhappens to run UNIX.andP;  To a large extent, UNIX on the Next machine is hiddenfrom users, provided they confine themselves in the applications that areavailable for the system and do not venture into the UNIX shells.andM;However, the methodology established for this column mandates that we examinea workstation n a specified, uniform manner.andP;  We look at how workstationsappear to programmers and system administrators, both from feature andperformance standpoints.andP;  Next is marketing its system as a box that runscertain applications, not as a general-purpose workstation.andP;  A portion ofthis review will address how Next has positioned its system, but the bulkwill evaluate the box as if it were any other UNIX-based workstation.andM;Discussing the Next product line is very simple compared to the productofferings of most other workstation vendors.andP;  Next currently offers one basicmodel.andP;  This system is based on the Motorola 68030 CPU chip, and theprocessor card always includes the matching 68882 FPU chip.andP;  The CPU chipitself contains 256 bytes of cache, but there are no other data orinstruction caches.andP;  The processor card also includes a Motorola 56001 DSPchip.andP;  The DSP chip certainly holds potential for use in voice recognitionand sound recording and playback, but as yet seems underutilized byapplication software.andP;  Next's inclusion of the DSP device seems to be aheadof the industry, but others are likely to follow.andM;The basic system comes standard with 8 MB of RAM.andP;  Another 8 MB of RAM can beadded optionally.andP;  Two serial ports, an Ethernet port, and an SCSI port arealso standard on the system.andP;  The system cabinet has four NuBus slots forexpansion purposes, although there appear to be relatively few hardwareoptions available that use this expansion bus.andM;The system includes a 17-inch monochrome monitor with an extremely crispdisplay and with 1120 x 832 pixel resolution.andP;  The Next system also includesan 85-key keyboard (there are no function keys) and a two-button mouse.andP;  Onething missing is a color monitor, which most companies offering expandableUNIX-based workstation products include.andP;  This seems an unfortunate omission,although for the applications provided with the Next operating system, coloris certainly not required.andM;Several mass-storage options are available.andP;  One of the highly publicizedfeatures at the system's introduction was its read/write optical disk.andO;Supplied by Canon, this removable disk can store 256 MB of data.andP;  The drivereplaces floppy disks arid tapes found on most other workstations.andP;  Initialsoftware and optional software products are installed using the opticaldrive.andP;  In addition, the operating system itself (contained on one opticalcartridge) can run entirely off of the optical drive.andM;The optical disk has several attractive features.andP;  Its high capacity andremovability allow it to hold much of a user's working environment and permitmultiple users to share one machine without having to share data.andP;  Thedrive's relatively slow speed makes it cumbersome to use as the system'sprimary storage device, and the high cost of the optical media (between $50and $100 per disk) adds appreciably to the cost of many of the softwareproducts.andM;While Next systems can be run with the optical disk used as the principaldrive, a more common approach is to boot the system (from a remote system)and then use hard disks located on another system via the Ethernet link.andO;This is similar to the diskless-node approach taken by other workstationcompanies.andP;  Next recommends having a 40 MB disk for use as a local pagingdisk if a diskless Next configuration is used.andM;Finally, Next supports both local 330 MB and 660 MB 5 1/4-inch SCSI harddisks.andP;  As on any other UNIX system, these are used with filesystems and thepaging area on the same local drive.andP;  After loading the whole operatingsystem and reserving paging space on a 330 MB hard drive, slightly less than100 MB of free space remains.andM;A key part of the Next system is its laser printer.andP;  The printer has aresolution of 400 dots per inch and a list price of $3495.andP;  This combinationmakes the Next PostScript laser printer very competitively priced,considering its set of excellent features.andP;  One of the reasons the printer ispriced so aggressively is that it is driven by software in the processor box,unlike an intelligent, standalone PostScript printer.andM;The system is packaged in a very distinctive manner.andP;  The base systemincluding optical disk and hard disk, if any) is a black cube one foot on aside.andP;  The monitor is in a black case with a built-in stand, and thepackaging is only slightly larger than the monitor itself.andP;  The laser printeris in a box 7 inches high, 17 inches wide, and 34 inches long  includingpaper trays) .andP;  Our overall impression of the packaging is that it's bothmodernistic and spiffy.andM;The cabling between the system pieces is unusual.andP;  The CPU cube and printerchassis both have power cords, while the monitor receives its power from theCPU cube.andP;  The keyboard and mouse plug into the monitor box, which has onefairly thick cable that runs to the CPU.andP;  Likewise, the printer has one thickcable to the CPU.andP;  Other than the Ethernet link, this is the entire cable setfor the system.andM;The power switch for the machine is located on the keyboard.andP;  When the powerkey is hit, the CPU cube, monitor, and printer all power up.andP;  Similarly, topower down the system, the keyboard power key is hit.andP;  In this case a panelthat gives the user the choice of shutting down or canceling the operation isdisplayed on the screen.andP;  If powering down the system is selected, all threesystem components are turned off.andM;The software supplied with the Next system is at least as significant to thestate-of-the-art feel of the system as any part of the hardware.andP;  Underlyingthe software is Next's version of UNIX, developed initially atCarnegie-Mellon University and known as Mach.andP;  This provides a base operatingsystem that appears similar to a BSD variant of UNIX.andP;  On top of this, Nexthas added NextStep, a package that manages the windows and presents userswith a common graphics-interface look and feel.andP;  Packages that run on theNext Computer all appear similar, which is a result of writing to conform tothe NextStep style.andP;  NextStep also supports Display PostScript as its singleimaging methodology.andM;A number of software packages are included with the operating system.andP;  Fornetworking, the Mach operating system includes NFS and the normal set ofEthernet utilities.andP;  Mach also includes enough of the standard UNIX utilitiesto make it essentially indistinguishable from most other versions of UNIX.andP;  Aversion of the GNU C compiler, extended to accommodate object-oriented&quot;objective C&quot;, is also included on the operating-system cartridge.andM;Beyond Mach and its utilities, Next provides a word-processing package(WriteNow) , a general-purpose search program, a dictionary program, andWolfram Research's Mathematica.andP;  This selection of applications isconsiderably larger than those generally provided with workstations fromother companies, and has a potential value of several thousand dollars.andP;  Wefound this application software interesting, generally useful, and robust.andO;Because there are few options for the Next machine, pricing is easilydescribed.andP;  The base system, with 8 MB of RAM, a 40 MB paging/swapping disk,and the 256 MB optical drive, is priced at $9995.andP;  The same system withoutthe optical drive is $7995.andP;  An additional 8 MB of RAM is $1295.andP;  The 330 MBand 660 MB disk drives are priced at $3695 and $6995 respectively.andP;  Finally,the laser printer has a list price of $3495.andP;  The operating system (and othersoftware described above) is bundled with the system.andM;Unlike most other system vendors, Next has a publicized, two-tier pricingstrategy.andP;  If purchased through a university (by students, faculty, or staff)the price is substantially lower The base system is priced at $6495, and thelaser printer is priced at $2000.andP;  There is also a GSA discount schedule forgovernment purchases.andM;On May 9, 1990, Next announced plans to offer an upgrade to the current Nextsystem.andP;  A 68040 upgrade for existing users is expected to be availablesometime in the fourth quarter of 1990.andP;  Next plans to use the 68040 in a newsystem as well.andP;  The upgrade from a 68030 to a 68040 will be priced at $1495,while the pricing of the new system itself has not been disclosed There hasbeen substantial industry speculation that Next will use a differentsystem-case design in future systems in order to lower manufacturing costs,but there has been no verification of what form or cost the future 68040systems will have.andM;For our evaluation we used the base Next system, priced at $9995.andP;  We addedthe 330 MB disk drive, priced at $3695, and the laser printer, priced at$3495.andP;  For our price/performance evaluation we do not include the price ofthe printer in the system total.andP;  The base operating system was used, and aFORTRAN compiler from Absoft (Rochester Hills, MI) was added for anadditional $995.andM;PurchasingandM;Purchasing Next systems is straightforward, if somewhat expensive.andP;  Nextsells to the government, through universities to those with universityaffiliation, and through Businessland outlets.andP;  For non-academic,non-government orders, Businessland is the only sales outlet in the US.andO;Canon, the manufacturer of the optical disk used in the Next system, sellsthe machine in Asia.andM;While Businessland has a reputation for price aggressiveness in the PC world,we were quoted list price for the Next system and its components.andP;  Thus, theNext system's list price must be compared to the street price of personalcomputers or workstations when considering its purchase.andM;Next made a giant leap when it became the first company to sell a UNIX-basedsystem through a national computer reseller.andP;  However, knowing that discountsare generally available on other systems, that a university affiliationwarrants a healthy discount, and that Businessland does not discount the Nextsystem because it need not compete with itself, all combine to give thepurchaser a bad feeling about paying list price for a Next system.andM;Delivery of the system and components did not seem to be a problem.andP;  Thesystem was in stock and immediately available where we checked on it.andP;  Theoptional pieces, including the printer, were likewise available immediatelyfrom the Businessland locations we investigated.andM;InstallationandM;Hardware installation was easy.andP;  The six cables (including the mouse)previously mentioned must be connected and the power button hit to power upthe system.andP;  None of the components is extremely heavy, so neither moving norpositioning the system should be a problem.andP;  The system comes packed in threeboxes (for the CPU cube, monitor, and printer) and has a simple but completehardware-installation manual.andM;If the optical cartridge is inserted, the system will-eventually-boot to theuser prompt when powered on.andP;  Operating in this mode is quite slow due to thelaggardly access time of the optical drive.andM;When running with a local hard disk, the user is responsible for transferringthe operating system from the optical disk to the hard drive.andP;  Instructionsfor performing this transfer are in the reference manual, and setting up theoperating system once it's transferred is easy.andP;  We were surprised at howlong the installation process took, however.andM;Once started, the transfer process does not require user intervention, butthe time required to inspect the hard disk and transfer the operating systemis not appreciably shorter than the time required, for example, to install aSun Sparcstation from tape.andP;  It took about two hours to get from machinepower-on to a point where the system was able to boot off of the hard-diskdrive.andP;  Given the quoted transfer rate of the optical disk, and the transferrate of an SCSI hard file, this was a lot longer than expected.andM;Support and DocumentationandM;Support for the Next system should come from the supplier, normallyBusinessland.andP;  Our conversations with two Businessland locations, however,did not give us a very positive feeling about the level of support that canbe expected through those channels.andP;  We suspect that the hardware support issolid and that hardware-related problems are diagnosed and fixed promptly.andO;We also suspect that software-related questions about the base operatingsystem and applications are answered promptly and accurately.andM;More complex UNIX- or network-related questions seem problematic, however,and we are not convinced that such questions can be addressed appropriatelyby Businessland.andP;  Clearly, as with all retail distribution channels, thequality of the support will depend upon the particular store chosen.andO;Businessland, al least, has a strong reputation for sophisticatedbusiness-computer sales.andM;Documentation is not a strong area for the Next system.andP;  The unit comes withthree manuals, two small ones for  getting started&quot; and network and systemadministration&quot;, and a much larger user reference.andP;  We believe the manuals doan adequate to good job of documenting the bundled applications and teachingthe user to login and logout of the system.andP;  The system-administration manualis actually fairly good, and performs a useful service by prompting the userthrough the screens that are encountered in the initial setup of the Ethernetenvironment.andM;Manual pages are on-line for Mach's commands.andP;  Their format is much like thatof any other UNIX manual page.andP;  These commands are not documented on paper,however, as there is no paper manual set for Next's version of UNIX.andM;The system-administration manual is only 80 pages in length, and there isessentially no documentation anywhere on the Mach system.andP;  The manual has noindex, making it somewhat difficult to use.andP;  For example, uucp seems never toappear in Next documentation: it is not in any table of contents, any index,and we never found a reference to it on any printed matter.andP;  Mail betweenEthernet-networked systems is supported, but in both the manuals and theadministration scripts, having a modem link to the outside world seems like aforeign idea to the Next system and is not documented.andM;The problems we have with documentation are primarily due to the differingroles for the Next box.andP;  If the box is bought as an appliance to run with theavailable end-user applications, the manuals seem sufficient.andP;  If purchasedto be used like other UNIX boxes, however, the manuals lack the basicmaterial necessary for most users.andM;Thus, the overall impression of the documentation is mixed.andP;  What isdocumented seems to be done well, but a great many areas lack documentationaltogether.andP;  From our perspective as UNIX users, we consider the omissionsquite noticeable and unfortunate.andP;  We also recognize that the manuals may bequite adequate for others who intend to use the machine differently.andM;Operation and Ease of UseandM;The Next machine and its associated NextStep user interface present the userwith a fully functional, easy-to-use graphical user interface.andP;  NextStep isdifferent than other GUIs, but those differences are neither particularlygood nor bad.andP;  We were able to use NextStep fairly quickly after setting upthe system, and felt comfortable with the interface after a reasonable amountof time.andP;  The learning process is not significantly easier than for X11 orother GUIs we have used, and because of this we were unable to power up thesystem and immediately start using it productively, as we had expected.andM;When the Next powers up, 1 1 icons are displayed (by default) and two panelsare opened.andP;  Of those 1 1, the only one we recognized when we first saw itwas the black hole, Next's equivalent of the wastepaper-basket icon.andP;  Weunderstood this function only because we had previously read about it.andP;  Fromour perspective there is nothing remarkably user-friendly about the system,but neither was it particularly difficult to learn.andP;  It just seems to haveslightly different ways of doing things compared to other systems.andM;The system administration and configuration of the Next operating system iseased with the NextStep interface.andP;  Many operating-system tasks areaccomplished using the several levels of menus and graphical prompts.andP;  Forthose operations set up by the Next machine itself, system administration ispretty easy.andP;  Our single biggest complaint about the Next operating system isthat not everything a UNIX administrator or user might want to do has beenset up in the user interface.andP;  Further, the operating system seems to expectthose operations performed by NextStep to be accomplished in only one way.andO;This became bothersome during the testing.andM;If Next systems are used in a homogeneous environment and are the first UNIXsystems used by a particular group, then the administration style mandated byNext might be acceptable.andP;  However, we feel that in a heterogeneousenvironment the administration style of the Next machine is so different fromthat of other UNIX systems that tending to the machine is harder than itneeds to be.andP;  For example, a menu is available on the Next to assist inadding a user; filling in blanks modifies the appropriate files, and a useris added to the machine.andM;But nowhere (that we found) does Next explain which files are modified when auser is added.andP;  it is not clear that finding and using the add-user menu isany easier than editing the password file, as is conventionally done on othersystems.andM;It is interesting (if somewhat embarrassing) to note that the password fileis one of several areas where we had unresolved problems with the Nextoperating system.andP;  We prefer the Bourne shell to the C shell.andP;  By default,the Next machine configures the root login to use the C shell.andP;  Normally, tochange this you can modify the password file to contain the Bourne shell asthe login shell (sh instead of csh)  We modified the password fileappropriately, but were unable to login to the Bourne shell; instead, we keptgetting the C shell.andP;  Of all the systems we have used to date, the Nextstands alone in not letting us login as root with the Bourne shell.andM;We had a few problems with the C compiler and with Absoft's FORTRAN.andP;  Theversion of C supplied by Next objects to including math.h where we use it inour benchmark tests, and instead requires removal of that line before asuccessful compilation can occur.andP;  For the Absoft FORTRAN, everything portedeasily with the exception of some problems with block data initialization andI/O list-directed output.andP;  Because our benchmark tests have been run on somany systems we are always surprised when there are any porting problems.andO;With the language compilers on the Next the problems are minor, but the Nextcompilers accept versions of the languages slightly different than those onother workstations.andM;Getting the Mach shell to run straight UNIX is neither easy nor welldocumented.andP;  When a Mach window is opened and vi is started, the default isto run vi in its open mode.andP;  Running vi as a line-oriented editor is not muchfun and we can see absolutely no reason why Next did this.andP;  it is almost asif Next wanted to make it difficult for someone to use its system as a UNIXbox.andM;From a hardware perspective, the Next machine is different enough to causeproblems.andP;  The Next system is not available with a floppy-disk or acartridge-tape drive.andP;  Because the optical disk is the only removable mediaon the system, the only easy method to interchange data and code from othersystems with the Next is over an Ethernet network.andP;  This only requiresanother system with Ethernet capabilities, but it makes life a little morerestricted for users.andM;Our overriding sense is that the Next machine is not as open as most otherUNIX systems.andP;  Next forces a number of implicit standards on users, which maybe a benefit in the long run.andP;  But for the short term, many of the Nextmachine's standard features cause problems for users operating in aheterogeneous environment.andM;PerformanceandM;Figure 1 shows the performance of the Next system compared with a number ofother personal computers and low-end workstations.andP;  Pricing for the Next isabout the same to slightly lower than that for the other systems.andM;As shown in Figure 1, the Next system did not do well on either CPU or FPUbenchmarks.andP;  On the Dhrystones test-a test of CPU performance-the Nextmachine achieved roughly half the performance of a 33 MHz 80386 system, andabout one-sixth the performance of a 33 MHz 80486 system.andP;  The Next's 6960Dhrystones is approximately the value achieved by a 20 MHz 80386 systemwithout a cache.andM;An interesting comparison can be made between the Next system and theHewlett-Packard 9000/345.andP;  While the 9000/345 runs at twice the clock rate,it achieved Dhrystone performance 2.75 times as high as that of the Next.andO;This extra performance boost on the HP system is a result, primarily, of its32 KB of cache.andM;The Dhrystone results of the Next were unusual in that the Dhrystone testuses internal timing routines and primarily measures  user&quot; time rather thanelapsed or &quot;real&quot; clock time.andP;  When we looked at elapsed time compared with&quot;user&quot; time, we found a 20 percent overhead in the system.andP;  That is, usersare actually given only about 80 percent of the processing power of thesystem, compared with the 92 to 95 percent generally found on other UNIXworkstations.andM;As with the CPU performance results, the floating-point performance of theNext was half or less than half the performance of the other systems shown inFigure 1.andP;  Increasing the clock rate of the 68030 would decrease thisperformance difference, but even the 50 MHz 68030 HP 9000/345 is near thebottom of the performance list for these systems.andP;  RISC and 80486 systems aresimply faster on floating-point operations than the Next's 68030/68882combination.andP;  In addition, on most 80386 and 80486 systems an optional Weitekfloating-point chip can be added for yet further improvement infloating-point performance.andM;Figure 2 shows disk-transfer rates, in kilobytes per second, achieved whenthe machines sequentially read 2 MB of data from an 8 MB file.andP;  The blocksize for this test varies from 512 to 8192 bytes.andP;  The Next system did wellon this test, coming in at or near the top of the performance list on threeof the four block sizes.andP;  With data rates in the range of 483 to 726 KB persecond, the Next system showed excellent sequential read performance.andM;The standard SCSI disk drive Next uses exhibited solid performance.andP;  Inaddition to the drive, the Mach operating system must have contributed tosequential read performance, as did some of the much-discussed I/O-channelhardware in the system.andM;Figure 3 shows data-transfer rates when the machines randomly read 2 MB ofdata from an 8 MB file.andP;  Again, we list data for four different block sizesranging from 512 to 8192 bytes.andP;  This particular test is sensitive to thelogical block size, the amount of main memory, the physical block size, howthe operating system handles buffers, and the performance of the disk-driveitself.andM;The performance of the Next box on this test was good, but the overallresults place the system in the middle of the those listed.andP;  The Sparcstationand HP 9000/345 were clearly the fastest, while the Next system is groupedclosely with the ALR PowerCache 33/4 system.andM;Figure 4 shows the results of a matrix arithmetic benchmark.andP;  In our test,matrices of size 100 x 100 are used.andP;  A variety of matrix operations isperformed on these arrays.andP;  The results of performing double-precision matrixadd and divide operations are shown in Figure 4, for the Next and for othermachines.andP;  Also shown are two different cases for each of the two arithmeticoperations.andP;  For the first case (unreversed), the array elements are accessedas A [i,j], where j varies the fastest.andP;  In the second case (reversed) , theelements are accessed as A [i,j] where the i value varies most rapidly.andM;Measurable performance gains are achieved on some systems by changing theorder of indexing, and this is due, we believe, primarily to the effects ofcache memory and to the types of compilers used.andP;  Note that if we were in apaging situation the difference in performance between the unreversed andreversed accessing methods could be many times larger than the smalldifferences shown in Figure 4.andM;The results shown in Figure 4 are somewhat surprising.andP;  The Next system wasthe slowest  in operations per second) on this test, as would be expected.andO;The ALR PowerCache 33/4 measured the fastest, and this is unexpected, basedon the floating-point performance shown in Figure 1.andP;  The reason is cachesize.andP;  The ALR 33/4 has 128 KB of cache, which is sufficient to holdsubstantial portions of the three 10,000-element double-precision arrays.andO;Also, the fill algorithm for the cache moves fairly large blocks of data,several at a time, into the cache.andP;  Compared to the DECstation 2100, whichhas only 32 KB of cache but faster arithmetic hardware, the larger cache ofthe ALR system clearly dominates the performance picture.andP;  Thus we concludethat for users doing substantial vector or array work, the size of thearrays, the size of the cache, and the cache-fill algorithm may be moreimportant than raw arithmetic calculation rates.andP;  Figure 5 shows WorkstationLaboratories' Khornerstone benchmark rating for the systems selected.andP;  TheKhornerstone test yields a normalized numerical rating of performance basedon a mix of floating-point-, processor- and disk-intensive tasks (21 in all), as well as another value representing the total time it takes to executeall the tests.andP;  The Khornerstone test was designed to assess machinesoperating under a single-user work load.andP;  The Next's performance falls aboutwhere expected, at one-half to one-third the overall performance of most ofthe other systems.andP;  The Next machine has excellent disk performance but slowfloating-point and CPU performance.andP;  Because the Khornerstone is a mix of thethree elements, the low CPU and FPU contributions keep the total Khornerstonevalue down.andP;  The 6055 score is roughly the same as that of a Sun-3/260, a 25MHz 68020-based system with cache that was a very popular workstation in1987.andM;One other area of performance concern is the window-display rates of the Nextsystem.andP;  When a Mach shell is opened, a window appears.andP;  As text scrollsthrough the window it is apparently saved, and may be reexamined using ascroll bar on the window.andP;  We have noticed that as more text scrolls throughthe window, its update rate becomes markedly slower.andP;  After using the windowfor a period of time the screen-update rate becomes unacceptably slow.andM;Price/PerformanceandM;Our price/performance measure is obtained by dividing the list price of asystem by its Khornerstone rating.andP;  Figure 6 shows the results of thiscalculation for the compared systems.andM;The Next box achieves the second highest  worst) price/performance ratio ofthe systems compared.andP;  Only the Compaq 386/33 has a Worse price/performancerating.andP;  Of the machines shown in Figure 6, only the Next system and theHewlett-Packard machine are likely to be sold al list price.andP;  Also, while theCompaq 386/33 has a higher list price than the Next, the street prices forthe Compaq are actually much lower for &quot;similar&quot; configurations, and theCompaq systems are generally faster.andM;Next's price/performance ratio does not explicitly reflect the value of thesoftware bundled with the system or of the high-resolution graphics screen,although all the systems shown have 640 x 480 resolution or better.andP;  Finally,the cost of the optical-disk drive is included in the price of the system,but does not contribute to our measure of performance.andM;The price/performance ratio shown in Figure 6 is based entirely upon, andtherefore only as valid as, the Khornerstone test itself.andP;  For veryfloating-point-intensive applications, the Next may not measure up to thevalue as shown, but for very disk-intensive single-user tasks, the Next wouldlook much better.andP;  If the system is to be used as a desk-top-publishingsystem, then the reasonably priced laser printer, high-resolution display,and acceptable performance are clearly the most important factors.andP;  In thiscase, the benchmarks used to describe performance are only marginally usefulin predicting user satisfaction with the system.andM;Report CardandM;The Next is a difficult box to rate impartially.andP;  For general-purposesoftware development and scientific programming, it has a number ofweaknesses.andP;  As an appliance computer that runs several generic textapplications, the system's rating is entirely dependent upon whether userslike the software packages, and a comparison of the effectiveness of theapplications is beyond the scope of a &quot;Tested Mettle&quot; article.andM;Installation of the operating system and ancillary programs is easy but didtake somewhat more time than we expected.andP;  But the process is about as easyas it can be without the software coming preinstalled.andP;  We rate it as &quot;good&quot;andM;Documentation is a weak area for the Next box, at least as far as Mach UNIXis concerned.andP;  The manuals seem adequate for the applications provided, butprinted UNIX manuals are not included, and there is little documentationprovided on programming for the system.andP;  It would be nearly impossible totake! what documentation we received and do even a minimal amount of softwaredevelopment.andP;  Its omission saves little in cost for Next, but causes problemsfor the user.andP;  We rate documentation as &quot;fair&quot;.andM;Support for the system is available through Businessland in the US.andP;  It seemslikely that the quality of support will vary, depending on location, and weare suspicious of the level of problem-solving knowledge at the saleslocations.andP;  Support is &quot;average&quot;.andM;The system is moderately, expandable, and rates an &quot;average&quot;.andP;  The hardwareseems surprisingly closed for a current workstation product, and maximumexpanded sizes for disk and RAM seem restrictively small.andP;  It is similar to aFord Model T-you can have the product in any color you want, as long as it isa black cube with a 17-inch monochrome display.andM;The operational characteristics of the system seem weak.andP;  Data can only beinterchanged with non-Next systems conveniently via Ethernet.andP;  The keyboardhas no function keys but includes the semi-dangerous power key.andP;  We did notlike the touch of the keyboard, but there seem to be no options from thirdparties for alternatives.andP;  The absence of documentation-even on basic UNIXfunctions such as changing the login shell for root-causes more problems thanit should.andP;  Next seems to have crossed a boundary in that in attempting tomake the system so easy to use it actually made the machine harder to workwith.andM;Operation is &quot;fair&quot;.andM;The operating system and NextStep windowing package provide a solid, reliablesystem, and earned a &quot;good&quot; on the report card.andP;  The learning process forNextStep is harder than we expected, but certainly not harder than otherwindow packages.andP;  We would have preferred to see a Sun Microsystems approachof merging a proprietary window package with X, rather than ignoring Xentirely.andP;  In general, we are concerned that in trying to break new groundfor user interfaces Next has ignored what has already been accomplished inthe industry, and has done this for few good reasons.andM;Overall performance on the Next was &quot;average&quot;, with disk performance beingquite good and CPU and floating-point performance fairly weak.andP;  Networkperformance was quite acceptable, while multitasking and multiuserperformance was not strong at all.andP;  Graphics performance, with DisplayPostScript as the primary imaging instrument, was hard to quantify.andM;Because of the fairly stiff price and moderate performance, price/performanceis &quot;good&quot; but not outstanding&quot;.andP;  The system's average selling price seems tobe near its list price, and many price-competitive systems are faster thanthe Next system.andM;Our overall rating for the Next Computer is &quot;average&quot;.andP;  This is a mixedvalue, relating both to how Next has positioned its system (as an appliancethat happens to run UNIX) and how we would rather a workstation behave.andP;  As aUNIX box, it lacks a number of essentials.andP;  As a tool, its acceptability isbased on whether its software packages do the appropriate job, on theimportance of being in a UNIX environment (rather than Apple Mac or PC DOS) ,and on whether packages such as FrameMaker on more general-purposeworkstations affect Next significantly.andP;  David Wilson is president ofWorkstation Laboratories, which performs software analysis on a variety ofcomputer systems (including personal computers, technical workstations, andmultiuser microcomputer systems).andP;
