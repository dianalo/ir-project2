Gorbachev president to replace Andrei Gromyko. Themove greatly increased Gorbachev's power by unifying the top partyand government jobs.   Gromyko retired from the presidency today, a day after steppingdown from the Politburo. The election of Gorbachev gives thereform-minded leader a greater hand in his efforts to revamp thetop-heavy Soviet political system.   In keeping with his goal of limiting the party's involvement inday-to-day management, Gorbachev told the national parliament thatit was time for local government bodies, or soviets, to take onmore responsibility.   ``The soviets must become the highest authority on theirterritory and eliminate the shortcomings of stagnation,'' Gorbachevsaid. ``The party will facilitate the enhancement of the role ofthe soviets.''   ``The soviets will take on their shoulders the major burden ofstate work,'' the 57-year-old leader said. ``As the situationchanges, we must change accordingly.   He was elected unanimously by the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet,the nation's top governmental body.   The Supreme Soviet also named Vladimir A. Kryuchkov head of theKGB secret police. He replaced Viktor M. Chebrikov, who was named asecretary of the party Central Committee in charge of legal andjudiciary affairs.   Acting on Gorbachev's recommendation, the Supreme Soviet namedAnatoly Lukyanov vice president. He replaced Pyotor Demichev, whowas stripped of his candidate membership on the Politburo on Fridayat a meeting of the policy-making Central Committee.   Lukyanov was named a candidate member of the Politburo.   Gromyko, 79, a Communist Party and government stalwart from thetime of Stalin through the first several years of Gorbachev'sreforms, had been expected to step down following his resignationfrom the Politburo on Friday.   His five-minute farewell address was greeted with thunderousapplause.   ``The star of socialism since October 1917 has constantly shinedand given light,'' he said. ``Thank you comrade deputies for thetrust you've granted me in the past and now. I have very deeprespect for it.''   He became president in July 1985 after 28 years as foreignminister.   Friday's Central Committee meeting also approved wide-rangingchanges in the party bureaucracy destined to increase Gorbachev'spowers.   Moscow' Communist Party leader, Lev N. Zaikov, said Gorbachevwas endorsed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and by theCentral Committee.   In an earlier report on the Supreme Soviet's meeting, Tass, theofficial Soviet news agency, said ``a few personnel questions''were on the agenda.   On Friday, Gorbachev also obtained the resignations of threeBrezhnev-era holdovers _ full Politburo member Mikhail S.Solomentsev, and candidate members Demichev and Vladimir Dolgikh.He streamlined the apparatus and put staunch supporters in keypositions in the party, which exercises sole control over thesubordinate government bureaucracy.   The decision to cut the number of government departments fromabout 20 to six means hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the SovietUnion's top party bureaucrats will lose their jobs.   In other moves, Yegor K. Ligachev, considered the Kremlin's No.2 leader, apparently was demoted in taking on the CentralCommittee's agriculture portfolio. A member of the ruling Politburowho earlier had been replaced as Communist Party chief forideology, Ligachev had widely been seen as a potential conservativerival to the Soviet leader.   Anatoly F. Dobrynin, 68, who served as ambassador to the UnitedStates for 24 years before returning to Moscow to oversee foreignrelations in the Central Committee, retired as secretary of thatbody.   This week's meetings in Moscow were called so hastily that theyforced several Kremlin leaders to cut short trips abroad and gaverise to speculation that Gorbachev might be trying to head offopposition to his broad program of social and economic reforms.   A senior Soviet political analyst said the changes clearlystrengthened Gorbachev's hand and would reduce tensions amongSoviet leaders.   One new member was named Friday to the Politburo, Vadim A.Medvedev. Medvedev, who was named to the Central Committee twoyears ago, vaulted over non-voting Politburo status to become afull member.   Medvedev took over responsibility for ideology in the CentralCommittee, Gorbachev adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev was assigned tointernational policy, and Nikolai Slyunkov was given responsibilityfor economic and social policy.   Ligachev was transferred to overseeing agricultural policy, anarea of immense importance to the Soviet economy. However, thatposition narrows his base in the Communist Party.</TEXT></DOC>
