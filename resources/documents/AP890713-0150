An intermediate court in the northeast port city of Dalian foundXiao Bin, 42, guilty of ``spreading counterrevolutionary rumors.''It deprived him of all political rights for three years.   The national evening television news showed Xiao, a juniorsection chief in a rubber factory, being led by police into thecourt to receive the verdict.   Xiao, in an interview with an ABC television crew, said 20,000people were killed in the military assault to re-capture TiananmenSquare from students demonstrating for democratic reforms. In anemotional statement, he told ABC that military tanks had run overpeople and troops had shot to death people wounded by beatings orgunfire.   China Central Television apparently intercepted the uneditedvideo as ABC sent it by satellite to its New York headquarters.   The state-run television subsequently broadcast the interview andurged viewers to help find the man. Two women reported him withinhours and he was arrested June 11. The women were commended andgiven cash rewards.   ABC said it was ``deeply distressed'' over the use of its tapeand began covering the faces of students it interviewed.   China denies anyone was killed on Tiananmen Square. It says about200 civilians were killed as troops battled rioters who threw stonesand firebombs to stop them from reaching the square.   Chinese sources and Western diplomats have said up to 3,000 mayhave died when troops opened fire on unarmed protesters.   Earlier Thursday, the Foreign Ministry denied China has become adiplomatic outcast because of the bloody events at Tiananmen. AForeign Ministry spokeswoman said most nations support China's toughmeasures to eliminate political dissent.   Spokeswoman Li Jinhua, asked at a weekly briefing how Chinareacts to the outpouring of international criticism, said: ``Yourassessment is different from mine.   ``The fact is that there are only a few countries who areinterfering in China's internal affairs. The majority of countrieshave expressed their understanding, sympathy and even support forus.''   She repeated China's protests to France for harboring wanteddissidents Wu'er Kaixi and Yan Jiaqi and said France was guilty of``flagrant violation of international law and the norms governinginternational relations.''   Most strong criticism has come from the West, although somecommunist countries such as Hungary and Yugoslavia also havedeplored the loss of life in the Tiananmen attack.   The only countries to support China's crackdown have beenhard-line communist states such as North Korea, Romania and EastGermany. Most Third World countries have said only that they have nowish to interfere in China's internal affairs.   On Wednesday, Premier Li Peng and new Communist Party chief JiangZemin told a gathering of ambassadors and diplomats they must``increase their work in explaining the truth to counter rumors ofWestern reports.'' Jiang said the diplomats must ``help foreignfriends get rid of their misunderstandings'' of recent events inChina.   Chinese authorities also tried to present their version of eventsThursday at a seminar with foreign tour agents in which they handedout copies of a government report that condemned the student-ledprotests as counterrevolutionary and carried pictures of soldiers'burnt and beaten bodies.   The travel agents, invited to Beijing as China seeks ways tosalvage its nearly defunct tourist industry, agreed that Beijingmust either lift martial law or reduce the military presence beforeit can expect foreign tourists to return.   China earned $2 billion in hard currency from tourism last year.   Beijing also has lost several major international conventions,including a meeting of the World Trade Centers Association that wasscheduled for September.   China's representative Zhang Ming expressed ``great regret''Thursday over the association's July 5 decision to change the siteof the 23-nation conference to Geneva.   He said China has been preparing for the annual meeting for ayear and that social order in Beijing has returned to normal andwill be further stabilized, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.   ``We will unswervingly carry out the policy of reform and openingand our trade and economic relations with other countries andregions will further develop. All foresighted economists andentrepreneurs can see this,'' Zhang said.</TEXT></DOC>
