Assassinations, bombings, death-squad style murders and massroundups of leftists have further disturbed a political climatethat has been roiled by nine years of civil war.   Marxist-led guerrillas have vowed to make the country``ungovernable'' by June 1, when Cristiani takes office.   The 41-year-old leader of the rightist Republican NationalistAlliance, or Arena, handily defeated the centrist ChristianDemocratic candidate in last month's presidential election.   Arena and U.S. officials have blamed the rebel Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front, or FMLN, for three recent assassinationsof rightists and a bomb attack on the home of thevice-president-elect.   Attorney General Roberto Garcia Alvarado was slain Wednesday bya bomb placed on the roof of his car when it stopped at a trafficlight.   The targeting of high-profile individuals _ a tactic notroutinely employed by the guerrillas in the past _ appears designedto provoke and undermine Cristiani. But who is doing it and whyremain unclear.   The guerrillas have neither claimed nor denied responsibilityfor the killing of Garcia. They did, however, deny responsibilityfor the April 14 bombing of vice president-elect Francisco Merino'shouse.   Both Cristiani and U.S. Ambassador William Walker have blamedthe recent wave of violence on guerrillas determined to provoke aharsh, repressive response from security forces.   According to this view, guerrilla sympathizers in the UnitedStates and Europe would point to a surge in rights abuse as reasonfor a cutoff of U.S. aid.   El Salvador receives about $1.5 million a day in U.S. economicand military assistance _ more than any other country in theWestern Hemisphere.   Some still-active Arena leaders have been linked to death squadsthat in the early 1980s killed thousands of suspected leftists. Theinsurgents continue to refer to Arena as ``the death-squad party.''   Arena denies the charge and Cristiani says the eight-year-oldorganization has evolved into a modern, conservative party similarto the U.S.'s Republican Party.   But Arena continues to harbor a far-right wing. Whether theCristiani faction of relatively moderate and modern capitalistswins out over oligarchic and fascist-minded elements remains to beseen.   ``An extremist sector of the right hopes to subjugate Cristianiand impose a hard military and political line,'' Ignacio Ellacuria,rector of the prestigious Jesuit-run Central American University,said Friday.   Left-leaning unions and other ``popular organizations'' havecondemned what they say is an increase in repression in recentweeks. Elementary school teacher Cristina Gomez was abducted fromher school, tortured and killed April 5 by heavily armed men incivilian clothes acting in broad daylight, apparently confidentthey would not be challenged by security forces.   Police and army troops on Wednesday and Thursday raided a unionheadquarters, the headquarters of a displaced person's group andthe offices of a women's association. More than 70 people werearrested.   ``The escalation of repression demonstrates the desperationbeing felt by the rich and powerful. They're starting to feel theeffect of the war and see their riches in danger,'' said TomasaRuiz, a member of the directorate of the raided refugee center.``So they declare war on the people.''   Cristiani said his government will act resolutely, but withinthe law, to ensure law and order.   Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, who met Thursdaywith lawmakers to discuss possible legislation to combatorganizations considered guerrilla fronts by the military, said hedoes not believe the current level of violence requires theimposition of a state of siege.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Doug Mine, based in San Salvador since lastyear, has reported extensively for The Associated Press fromCentral America.</TEXT></DOC>
