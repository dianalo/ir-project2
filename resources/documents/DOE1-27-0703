The Pacific NorthwestLaboratory (PNL) has designed cameras for use with glass melters at PNL,the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP), and West Valley DemonstrationProject (WVDP). This report is a compilation of these designs. Operatingexperiences with one camera designed for the PNL melter are discussed.A camera has been fabricated and tested on the High-Bay Ceramic Melter(HBCM) and the Pilot-Scale Ceramic Melter (PSCM) at PNL. The camera provedto be an effective tool for monitoring the cold cap formed as the feedpool developed on the molten glass surface and for observing the physicalcondition of the melter. Originally, the camera was built to operateusing the visible light spectrum in the melter. It was later modifiedto operate using the infrared (ir) spectrum. In either configuration,the picture quality decreases as the size of the cold cap increases.Large cold caps cover the molten glass, reducing the amount of visiblelight and reducing the plenum temperatures below 600{sup 0}C. This temperaturecorresponds to the lowest level of blackbody radiation to which the videotube is sensitive. The camera has been tested in melter environmentsfor about 1900 h. The camera has withstood mechanical shocks and vibrations.The cooling system in the camera has proved effective in maintainingthe optical and electronic components within acceptable temperature ranges.10 refs., 15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
