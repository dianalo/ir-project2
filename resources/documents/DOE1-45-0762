<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0762 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report describes the first two years of a study co-sponsored by DOEand the U.S. Navy to determine which antioxidant additives are most effectivein delaying fuel degradation in a variety of middle-distillate straight-runlight-cycle oil blends. In this study, straight-run middle distillateand catalytically cracked product were mixed at ratios of 85:15, 70:30,and 60:40, respectively. All of these blended fuels were immediatelytreated with commercially available additives. Usual dosages were 12and 24 ppm (volume/volume). Stability testing and fuel characterizationsperformed at four different laboratories were used to evaluate the additives.Each laboratory used a different type of stability test. The characterizationstudies were performed to ensure that the base fuel blends tested werewithin the range allowed by MIL-F-16884H and to determine whether anyof the additives would make the fuels unacceptable for Navy use.</TEXT></DOC>
