(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gary McGivern is both an environmentalactivist and a convicted cop killer, a combination which may provedeadly to an annual festival that raises money for conservation.   The Westchester County executive says that because McGivern editsa newsletter published by the event's sponsor, the county will backout of the Great Hudson River Festival in coming years. Countypolice say they won't help patrol the festival this year in theiroff hours.   ``This guy is a convicted killer of a police officer who was amember of my department,'' said Ronald Harbolic, head of the countyPolice Benevolent Association. ``We aren't going to work for peoplewho hire cop-killers.''   For five years, McGivern and his wife Marguerite Culp haveco-edited The Navigator, the newsletter of the Hudson River SloopClearwater, the group founded by folksinger Pete Seeger to helpclean up the Hudson River.   McGivern did his work from a prison cell until this year, when hewas granted clemency by Gov. Mario Cuomo. McGivern, who has alwaysclaimed his innocence, was convicted of the 1968 murder ofWestchester Deputy Sheriff William Fitzgerald.   This year's festival is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday atWestchester Community College. It has roots going back more than 20years, when Seeger sang on a lawn and passed the hat to raise moneyto build the Clearwater, a replica of a 19th century sloop. The shiphas sailed the Hudson to promote efforts to clean the river, effortsthat have met with some success.   The full-scale festival has been staged annually for 12 years.   Last year, 20,000 people attended. The county contributedservices it estimated to be worth $45,000, including bustransportation, park attendants and police. The county also allowsuse of the college campus.   ``It's an impossible situation for Westchester to give up to$45,000 in taxpayer dollars to an organization which hired a copkiller, someone who murdered a Westchester County deputy sheriff,''said County Executive Andrew O'Rourke. ``It's impossible tounderwrite the organization. Public money can be better spent thanpaying Gary McGivern.'' McGivern and his wife put out the newsletterunder a contract.   John Mylod, executive director of the Clearwater, said theorganization knew who McGivern was when he was hired and has nevertried to hide him.   O'Rourke and Harbolic both said they failed to notice McGivern'sname on the newsletter's masthead and had not seen a festivalprogram in which McGivern and Culp were pictured and profiled.   McGivern and his wife declined to be interviewed about thecontroversy.   McGivern, 44, has maintained he was innocent in the 1968 shootingof Fitzgerald which occurred while McGivern and two other inmateswere being transported from the Auburn Correctional Facility to aWhite Plains court.   McGivern was serving time on a robbery charge when the shootingoccurred. He said one of the other two inmates did the shooting.That inmate was killed in the shootout along with the deputy sheriff.   He a model inmate and made powerful friends, such as Seeger,Cuomo and columnist William F. Buckley. When he was released thisyear, the parole board cited his ``outstanding record ofinstitutional adjustment.''   Mylod indicated that McGivern would not be let go because of thethreats and protests: ``Some hateful things are being said. It'sunfortunate ... but we're not going to change anything.''   Mylod said he thought the Clearwater's 1,500 volunteers would beable to handle any problems at the festival this year.   He was unmoved by suggestions that some people might stay awayfrom the festival this year because of the McGivern connection;that's their right, he said. The same, he said, goes for policeofficers who may picket the fair.   ``We may not have to worry about next year,'' he said. ``If it'sa bad year financially _ especially if it really rains _ that mayanswer the question about next year from a practical, financialpoint of view rather than a political one.''</TEXT></DOC>
