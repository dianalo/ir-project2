The consequences of selling, trading and repackaging debt areonly now beginning to bubble to the surface, economists andfinancial strategists say.   ``What's still unfinished is determining how excessive was theexcess lending,'' said James Grant, a credit-market analyst whowrites a newsletter about interest rate trends.   ``That's not just the unfinished business of the year but of thedecade,'' Grant said. ``So what we'll discover as the `90s roll inis just how reckless was reckless.''   The final weeks of the year left the federal budget deficitgrowing so fast it could bump against the $100 billion Gramm-Rudmanannual ceiling eight months before the fiscal year ends,threatening to provoke a new round of cuts in government aidprograms at a time when the ranks of the poor are growing.   Bankers on both coasts have suddenly realized what theircounterparts in the oil and farming regions have known for years: Adeclining property market makes mortgages to many homebuyers anddevelopers unprofitable, compounding the default problems raised byother risky lending.   ``I think our society is debt fragile,'' said Robert Dugger,chief economist of the American Bankers Association in Washington.``And a major part of the unfinished business left over for the1990s is correcting the statutory (tax) incentives we have to usedebt rather than equity to finance.''   Some banking analysts now worry that a severe economic declinecould cause an alarming number of bank failures, forcing thegovernment to rescue depositor funds with the kind ofmegabillion-dollar bailout it faces from the savings and loancrisis.   On the corporate level, the twilight of 1989 left somehigh-profile companies in almost hopeless hock and others battlingfor time to pay their bills, a partial result of an unprecedentedera of debt-financed takeovers.   The end of the year also cast a shadow on the $200 billionmarket for high-yield, high-risk IOUs known as junk bonds, onceconsidered the wonder-drug of finance but now shunned by manyinvestors and banks, fearful of getting burned.   Investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., an aggressiveuser of junk bonds for takeovers, watched one of its debt-financedcompanies retreat to bankruptcy court this past week. HillsboroughHoldings Corp., formed by Kohlberg to acquire building materialsmaker Jim Walter Corp. for $2.4 billion, sought Chapter 11protection.   Perhaps the biggest junk bond casualty is Campeau Corp., thegiant retailer now facing relentless pressure from creditors andsuppliers who want reassurances they'll get paid. Campeau's storesowe more than $7 billion, which has forced the parent company toput its crown jewel, the swank Bloomingdale's chain, up for sale.   Such problems tend to set off chain reactions. For example,Campeau's inability to pay suppliers could derail another bigdebt-financed takeover, the $3 billion acquisition ofsheet-and-towel maker West Point-Pepperell by Chicago industrialistWilliam Farley, maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear.   If Campeau can't pay West Point-Pepperell, Farley might have tosell Fruit of the Loom to pay his debts _ the financial equivalentof selling the underwear off his back.   ``All these fellows need nice, pliable suggestable lenders, whohave belatedly woken up,'' Grant said. ``In the debt financingbusiness, the kneebone's connected to the thighbone.''   The financing vacuum has frozen the frenetic pace of takeovers,making the future of that trend another piece of unfinishedbusiness for the year. Few deals over $2 billion _ a paltry sum bylast year's standards _ were completed in 1989.   ``The megadeals are pretty much gone,'' said Steven P. Galante,managing director of Buyout Publications, a Needham, Mass.,newsletter that tracks developments in corporate mergers.   ``Primarily it has to do with the lenders,'' Galante said.``They're under intense scrutiny. They're not making loans atprices that have been paid in the past.''   Fears that debt and bankruptcy will be the business legacy ofthe '80s are by no means universal. Many economists reject thisthinking as outdated and overblown. Some say the U.S. economicposition at the end of the year was stronger than ever and thatmost corporate borrowing remains healthy.   ``I don't believe the trouble in the junk bond market means thatdeals that aren't appropriate on their merits won't get done,''said Giulio Martini, economist at Sanford C. Berstein andamp; Co., a NewYork investment firm.   ``The junk bond market is a $200 billion market in a $5 trillioneconomy. You'd have to have more severe problems to have much of aneffect,'' said Martini, who has forecast a relatively strongeconomy for 1990.   Others believe the problems faced by businesses that have riskedtheir existence through debt are simply paying the price ofsurviving in a capitalist economy. The net result, they say, ismore efficiency.   ``Most of the companies that go bankrupt continue to producegoods and services,'' said Allan Meltzer, an economist at theCarnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``When people get wipedout, somebody takes their place.''
