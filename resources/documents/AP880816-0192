Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the platform chairman, called it ``arallying cry for all those who share our values.''   There was neither dissent nor debate on a single plank. The hallwas half-empty as Orr and other platform leaders spent 45 minutessinging the praises of their 40,000-word declaration of philosophy,titled, ``An American Vision: For Our Children and Our Future.''   ``I didn't hear any no's,'' Orr said after finishing her workand producing a document that speaks to scores of issues, from thespace-based defense shield that it extols to a heifer tax that itopposes.   Orr, who has said it would cost $43 billion to carry outprograms implicit in the Democrats' platform, was unable to say howmuch it would cost to make good on the GOP's promises. Pressed foran estimate, she said, ``It's a busy week.''</TEXT><HEAD>FOLLOWING TWO GRAFS EMBARGOED FOR 7:35 P.M. CDT</HEAD><TEXT>   Later, in a speech to the convention's evening session, Orrboasted that the GOP document ``is far, far superior to theplatform the Democrats cobbled together in Atlanta.''   ``You won't find some very basic words in the Democraticplatform _ words like `tax' or `revenue' or `unemployment.' Youwon't find any mention of NATO. You won't find the words `church'or `synagogue'. ... '' Orr said. ``They don't want the people toknow that they are still the party that will raise taxes and weakenour defense.''</TEXT><HEAD>END EMBARGOED MATTER</HEAD><TEXT>   Marilyn Thayer of New Orleans called it ``our love-letter to theAmerican family.'' She said the platform ``stands on ourJudeo-Christian tradition. ... It spells the doom of corruption ingovernment and of pornography.''   ``We're not just against abortion. We're for adoption reform ...for more tax relief for families (and) an all-out crusade againstinfant morality and birth defects,'' she said.   Even mothers at home with kids would benefit from the child caretax credit because ``Republicans know every mom is a first-classmom, and we're going to help them all,'' said Thayer.   ``It's hard to take a stand on controversial issues, but weRepublicans would rather take a stand than take a walk,'' saidPatricia Goodrich of Madison, Wis.   The platform toes the conservative line on taxes, abortion anddefense. It accuses the Democrats of tolerating corruption andcalls for subjecting Congress itself to civil rights, health andsafety laws.   The 104-page text is 25 percent longer than the 1984 GOPplatform and eight times the length of the bare-bones platform theDemocrats approved in Atlanta four weeks ago.   The GOP platform echoes the 1984 document in pledging no taxincreases, calling for a constitutional ``human life'' amendment toban abortion and promising ``peace through strength.''   It promotes George Bush's positions in favor of child-care taxcredits for low-income families, increased funds for Head Start, anew ``merit schools'' program, and tax-free savings bonds forcollege.   It calls for `compassion and help'' for those who suffer fromAIDS, but also stresses the need to ``protect those who do not havethe disease.''   It became certain Monday there would be no minority planks whenthe 106-member Republican Platform Committee approved the documentwith only two dissenting votes: Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and MaryBoatwright, both of Connecticut.   No one attempted to gather the 27 signatures needed to file aminority report.   Boatwright was returning home after injuring her leg Monday inan escalator mishap.</TEXT></DOC>
