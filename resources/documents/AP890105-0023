Research on new types of nuclear reactors is one way to developenergy sources that produce no carbon dioxide, a principal cause ofthe atmospheric warming, said a panel convened by the NationalAcademy of Sciences and two sister organizations.   The academy, the National Academy of Engineering and the NationalInstitute of Medicine made a series of recommendations to thepresident-elect on the environment, AIDS, space and science policy.   In a cover letter to Bush, the presidents of the three bodiessaid, ``global environmental change must be made more prominent inthe scientific, political and foreign policy agendas of the UnitedStates.''   The letter concentrated on five other points:   _Since global warming and acid rain are both produced by use offossil fuels, ``efforts to enhance both energy efficiency andconservation should be strengthened.'' It added that ways toincrease ``use of the `cleanest' fossil fuels, such as natural gas,should be considered, but in the context of their finiteavailability.''   _Immediate assessment of possible responses to rising sea levels,drought and the northward migration of agricultural zones.   _Nations that have signed a treaty to reduce emissions thatdestroy the ozone layer should be encouraged to accelerate thosereductions and aim at a ``total phaseout.'' These chemical accountfor about a fifth of the expected global warming. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency already has called for such a phaseout.   _Strategies are needed to prevent the destruction of tropicalforests. The loss of forests around the world probably adds a fifthof the carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels, the group said. Anarea the size of Missouri is lost each year, according to someestimates, and if nothing is done there could be no tropical forestsleft early in the next century, the panel said.   _A ``substantial investment'' is needed in ground-based andspace-based monitoring of the earth.   ``Leadership by the United States could be a powerful force foruniting the nations of the world in a common endeavor vitallyimportant to all,'' the academy presidents said.   The report cited predictions of a two-to-nine degrees Fahrenheitincrease in average temperatures sometime in the next century andsaid: ``While global environmental change cannot be stopped, thepace of change can be slowed.''   ``Production of energy from fossil fuels is the root of severalof the agents of global environmental change,'' the report said.   The report also recommended re-examining use of wind and solarenergy ``to see if recent progress has improved their economicfeasibility as possible substitutes for fossil fuels in the yearsahead.''</TEXT></DOC>
