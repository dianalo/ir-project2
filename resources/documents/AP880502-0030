Now we have the answer: grueling.   Because some of the 13 delegations are mainly or exclusivelyChristian, part of the cartel's oil negotiations took place duringthe day. That's the normal time for OPEC business.   But because the Moslem members prefer to slow down during theirsunrise-to-sunset fast, the formal OPEC sessions started late atnight, after the Moslems had eaten their ``breakfast.''   As a result, some of the oil debate was in progress almostaround the clock.   The non-Moslem oil ministers found it hard to cope with theschedule, which forced them to try to sleep part of the day.   One said he was taking pills to stay awake during the nighttimesessions.   Some said they felt as though they had been hit with jet lag,minus the travel.</TEXT><TEXT>   Often it's hard to understand why OPEC leaders have so muchtrouble settling their differences over oil policy.   Once in a while it's easy. Consider a comment by Ali KhalifaSabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, to reporters who asked whether hewas ready to give up his minority opposition to an OPEC plan:   ``I usually am very reasonable and willing to discuss anything,once our point of view has been accepted.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Another clue to why OPEC's meetings often last longer than wouldseem necessary:   ``We know that some (delegates) like to be out of our respectivecountries,'' said an official from an African OPEC member. ``Aweekend in Europe _ not bad.''</TEXT><TEXT>   It's getting harder to classify the players in the internationaloil game.   Time was, and not long ago, you had two types: those in OPEC andthose outside it.   At the latest OPEC conference the distinctions were a littleless clear.   You had the usual 13 OPEC members. But you also had somethingcalled ``non-OPEC,'' an unofficial association of six independentoil-producing nations, including Mexico and China, that wants toestablish formal ties to the cartel without becoming members.   Then you had three other oil producers _ Norway, the Canadianprovince of Alberta and the state of Texas _ who wanted to rubelbows with the OPEC leaders but still keep enough distance tostand outside the ``non-OPEC'' camp.   Some called these three ``near non-OPEC.''   And then there are the rest, producers such as the Soviet Unionand Britain that want to have nothing to do with the cartel.</TEXT><TEXT>   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission thatregulates the state's oil industry, met several staffers at OPECheadquarters last week, including the deputy secretary general,Fadhil Chalabi.   He said he found them knowledgeable about oil but also verycautious.   ``I guess I would be, too, if I had 13 bosses,'' he said.</TEXT><TEXT>   Rilwanu Lukman, a Nigerian, is the top OPEC boss, at least intitle. He is president of the formal conferences and the highestranking spokesman for the cartel.   At the end of the latest meeting Lukman lashed out at the newsmedia, accusing it of trying to stampede OPEC into making decisions.   ``Why should we make a decision just because you say weshould?'' he said in a high-pitched tone to one reporter.</TEXT></DOC>
