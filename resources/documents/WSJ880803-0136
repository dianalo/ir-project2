Plotkin, his personal physician since 1971. &quot;You have had no major ailments during your entire life and there is nothing in your past or current medical history which should interfere with your ability to serve as President,&quot; Dr. Plotkin wrote. &quot;I have seen you on a number of occasions for minor, self-limited ailments and regular health reviews (check-ups),&quot; he added. &quot;Throughout this period you have been in excellent physical health and condition.&quot;    The Governor declined to release his full medical records, however, though presidential candidates typically have, especially since Senator Thomas Eagleton had to withdraw as a vice-presidential nominee when it was learned he had undergone electroshock treatment. Vice President Bush has not released medical records during this campaign, though he did in 1980 and has released the results of annual physicals while serving as Vice President. And in an article published yesterday, the Detroit News reported that the Vice President responded to a health questionnaire it submitted, talking about his arthritic hip and the duodenal ulcer he suffered in the 1960s.    The News reported, however, that Mr. Dukakis declined to respond to the same questionnaire. It noted that he has consistently turned down such questions &quot;citing his right to privacy.&quot; The Boston Globe reported that in a Friday press conference at Springfield, Ill., the Governor was asked whether he would release the records, and replied, &quot;No.&quot;    At an ensuing photo opportunity, the Globe added, a Boston Herald reporter asked whether the Governor was aware of suggestions that he had undergone psychiatric treatment; he shrugged and walked away without responding. The Globe added, &quot;Rumors that Dukakis suffered a depression for which he had to be treated have been circulating for months. The Globe investigated the rumors and was unable to substantiate them.&quot; It also reported that after the Friday press conference, Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said the Governor &quot;has never been treated for mental depression or mental illness of any kind, at any time.&quot;    We suppose that in the end Governor Dukakis will release his records, and that they will refute the rumors about his depression. The assembled press will breathe a sigh of relief, and may even boo if anyone tries to question too hard -- as they did when one of our editorial writers started to challenge Geraldine Ferraro when she released what passed for her husband's tax returns in 1984. Mr. Dukakis may even come out of the episode as the victim of an unfounded smear.    What strikes us in the health-record issue, though, is how little the American people know about this man nominated to be their President. And upon whom, to judge by the polls, many voters have projected their hopes for an efficient, uncomplicated, straight-arrow leader.    Why should such a man choke up about his health records? This is the same candidate who pledges, after all, &quot;There will be no secrets kept from the American people in a Dukakis administration.&quot; Nor did the Dukakis campaign concede much to the right of privacy when investigating prospective vice-presidential running mates, who were asked for complete medical records. Tipper Gore, the wife of Senator Albert Gore Jr., was asked whether she'd had extramarital affairs.    Perhaps most important, a cool candidate would recognize that disclosure is the best antidote to rumors. In Mr. Dukakis's case depression rumors were predictable enough from two incidents in his biography -- &quot;Dukakis, an American Odyssey,&quot; by Boston Globe reporters Charles Kenney and Robert L. Turner (Houghton Mifflin 1988).    Mr. Dukakis's brother Stelian, who died in 1973 after being hit by a car while riding a bicycle, clearly did suffer from depression. While at college in 1951, he suffered a mental breakdown, attempted suicide, was institutionalized for three or four months and received insulin and shock treatments. He recovered well enough to complete college and hold a succession of jobs, but continued to suffer emotional problems and display odd behavior -- including in one instance distributing pamphlets opposing his brother in an election.    This family history is combined with descriptions of the Governor's own reaction to his defeat in the 1978 Democratic primary after his first term as Governor. Edward King's victory left him &quot;very dejected,&quot; his appointments secretary said. &quot;He would spend long periods sitting in his office, introspectively staring off into space.&quot; Another aide described him as &quot;depressed and sullen,&quot; and his wife said, &quot;At one point I was really worried about him.&quot; Despite these worries, the biography quotes Mr. Dukakis as saying he didn't seek professional counseling and has never consulted a psychiatrist.    Given this background, though, we should think Mr. Dukakis would have released his health records early and often. Certainly that's how he chose to deal with his wife's 25-year amphetamine addiction -- holding an early press conference to disclose the problem and say it had been licked. Except in two instances, his wife said, she managed to conceal her pills from her husband. His biographers also note, &quot;Incredibly, Michael says he does not remember whether Stelian tried to kill himself.&quot;    By now several news organizations, including our own Washington bureau, have requested that both candidates issue complete health records. But even without seeing Mr. Dukakis's records and having no reason to doubt they substantiate Dr. Plotkin's letter, it is not too early to say there is something curious going on here. The question is not so much is Michael Dukakis in good health, but rather, is Michael Dukakis really what the voters think they see? </TEXT></DOC>
