The move is part of an overall corporate move to improve efficiency at the company's parent, McDonnell Douglas Corp., a St. Louis defense contractor and commercial aircraft concern that has experienced problems controlling costs and meeting production schedules. It said last month that it would review all 800 management positions at its helicopter unit as part of a streamlining.    Keeping vice president posts at the helicopter company, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, were Dean C. Borgman, Stuart D. Dodge, Norman B. Hirsh, Allen C. Haggerty, J. James Schwalm and Paul K. Henney. Leonard J. Deney, who had been director of contracts and pricing, also was named a vice president.    The restructuring reduced the number of helicopter-company divisions to seven from 14, the unit said. </TEXT></DOC>
