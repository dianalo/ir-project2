The authorshave found fibers or cylinders from only the lower San Andres Formationunits 4 and 5, the upper San Andres Formation, and the Salado-Transillsalt. The fibers are inorganic, light to dark reddish brown, pleochroic,highly birefringent, filamentary single crystals, andless; 1 to {similar_to}5 {mu}m in diameter, with length-to-diameter ratios of at least 20:1.The fibers can be straight and/or curved, can bifurcate, can form loops,waves or spirals, and can be isolated or in parallel groups. Detailedpetrographic analyses show no evidence for recrystallization or deformationof the enclosing salt after fiber formation. Although the authors observationsdo not provide a definitive explanation for fiber origin, they suggestthat the fibers grew in situ by a solid-state diffusional process atlow temperatures. The cylinders are pleochroic, highly birefringent,light to dark reddish brown, hollow, thin-walled, open-ended right cylinders,having a 1- to 2-{mu}m wall thickness and variable lengths and diameters.There also appear to be single crystals of cryptomelane-hollandite, butthese are found almost entirely in fluid inclusions in the chevron andclear salt. Their presence in the primary halite suggests that they wereformed contemporaneously with the chevron structure and were accidentallytrapped in the fluid inclusions. The observation of cylinders partiallyor completely enclosed by salt stratigraphically above large fluid inclusionssuggests that natural downward fluid-inclusion migration has occurred,in response to the geothermal gradient.</TEXT></DOC>
