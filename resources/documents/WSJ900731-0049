Fino's precarious doublelife was about to unravel.   The devoted son of a high-ranking Buffalo mobster, Mr.Fino had for 15 years headed that city's Local 210 of theLaborers International Union of North America. During allthose years he had also been an informant for the FederalBureau of Investigation, feeding the government evidence ofthe union's ties to organized crime.</LP><TEXT>   Now, by late 1988, the mob had finally turned wary. AMafia official summoned Mr. Fino to a sit-down in the coffeeshop of Buffalo's Veterans Administration hospital. &quot;I'mgoing to have to frisk you,&quot; he told Mr. Fino.   &quot;I had known this man a long time,&quot; Mr. Fino recallstoday. &quot;I said, `Shame on you.' He said, `Out of respect foryour father, I won't do it.'&quot;   The wire Mr. Fino was wearing that day -- in a pack ofcigarettes in his pocket -- went undetected. Nonetheless, themobster delivered a warning: &quot;He told me,&quot; Mr. Fino says,&quot;that I couldn't be trusted any longer.&quot;   Mr. Fino took heed. Soon afterward, he fled Buffalo,assumed a new name and went into hiding, where he remainstoday. So far, Mr. Fino's information has helped indict threeLocal 210 officers, and has linked the Mafia to Laborersunion locals in other cities, says G. Robert Langford, theFBI's Buffalo chief.   As a prosecution witness, Mr. Fino will figure prominentlyin the government's attempts to smash the Mafia leadership inBuffalo and clamp a court trusteeship on Local 210 undercivil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations, or RICO, law.   &quot;He was a very big help,&quot; says the FBI's Mr. Langford. &quot;Hesteered us in the right direction in a number ofinvestigations.&quot;   In telling his story to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Finoprovides a rare account of a life and career shaped by hisMafia birthright -- a legacy that he freely chose to betray.It is a portrait of the informer's dangerous tightrope act:of the duplicity, agility and nerve such a performancedemands, and of its aftermath of bitterness and fear.   The government has in recent years come to rely heavily onundercover informants to combat organized crime. Theimprisonment of numerous mob bosses under RICO has served toweaken the Mafia's code of silence, long bred of fear and theperception of invincibility. Stiff RICO penalties havefurther eroded Mafia loyalties, giving mobsters and theirassociates powerful incentive to cooperate in return forlighter sentences.   As an informant, Mr. Fino is something of an anomaly. Henever joined the Mafia; he declined an invitation to become amember, though it came from the same reputed &quot;capo&quot; whoearlier had recruited his father. Nor was he coerced tobecome an informant; he wasn't facing criminal charges whenhe volunteered his services to the FBI. (Years later, whileworking undercover, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in afraud case and received two years' probation.)   Mr. Fino wasn't paid by the FBI during his yearsundercover. He began receiving payments -- now $6,000 a month-- from the bureau in March 1989 after agreeing to become aprosecution witness in future trials. FBI agents accompanyhim on plane trips and during court appearances. &quot;We haveheard there is a price on his head, and we consider it avalid threat,&quot; says the FBI's Mr. Langford.   Mr. Fino, now 44, never relaxes his guard. When jogging,he says, &quot;if I see somebody who looks like a stranger,somebody looks like he's checking me out, I report it to theFBI.&quot;   In Buffalo, Mr. Fino is denounced by Paul Cambria Jr., theattorney for a Local 210 officer whom Mr. Fino has implicatedin a crime. For many years, Mr. Cambria contends, the FBI hastried without success to brand Local 210 as mob-controlled.&quot;It looks as if this time they're going to attempt to proveit by using Ron Fino,&quot; who, he says, &quot;resigned from Local 210probably because he was not able to take it over and run itthe way he would like to.&quot;   Mr. Fino's personal life is in shambles. His wife, Donna,to whom he never disclosed his FBI spying, divorced him lastNovember. His two brothers no longer speak to him. One ofthem, Patrick Fino, says: &quot;Shame on him because he left hiswife and kids.&quot; Fear for his own safety kept Ron Fino fromattending his mother's funeral in Buffalo last December.   &quot;I try to live a halfway normal life,&quot; he says. &quot;But it'sdifficult. I can't go and come like a normal person. Thetoughest thing is my children -- I don't see them.&quot; His son,19, and daughter, 17, live with their mother.   Life in solitary exile is a far cry from his heady yearsas a labor leader, when his salary and benefits totaled$85,000 a year. There were union-supplied Cadillacs, trips toMiami and Hawaii, bottles of Montrachet, friends in highplaces.   &quot;Fino had a generally good reputation,&quot; says DennisGorski, county executive of Erie County, where Buffalo issituated. &quot;He participated in a wide variety of civic andhumanitarian projects.&quot;   A frequent fund-raiser for worthy causes, Mr. Fino washonored by the Buffalo chapter of the National Associationfor the Advancement of Colored People. And under hisleadership, Local 210 was part of a group that lent money fordowntown redevelopment projects, including construction ofBuffalo's Hyatt Regency hotel. &quot;When Ron Fino gave his word,to my knowledge he kept it,&quot; says Paul Snyder Sr., managingdirector of the partnership that owns the Hyatt Regency.   Some people in Buffalo are still puzzled why Mr. Finowould forsake everything for the dubious privilege ofexposing Mafia crimes. One explanation is that he neverintended to pay so dearly. Another, perhaps, can be traced todeep conflicts about his Mafia upbringing.   &quot;I could never get rid of the feeling that I was one ofthem,&quot; Mr. Fino says. &quot;You have this original sin that neverwashes away.   &quot;It affected everything. In high school, I'd date a newgirl. Next time I called up for a date, her parents wouldn'tlet her go out with me. They'd read about my father in thepaper.&quot;   Milwaukee-born Joseph (Ebe) Fino worked as a bookie,taking bets on horses and baseball. A 1963 U.S. Senate reporton organized crime traces his rise in the Buffalo Mafia from&quot;hoodlum status to upper-echelon rank.&quot; He was boss of theBuffalo crime family from 1968 to 1972.   For a time, according to the Senate report, Joe Finoserved as a Mafia enforcer. Once, his son says, the elder Mr.Fino killed a man -- the lover of a mobster's unfaithfulwife. &quot;The mob directed that the guy be killed, and my fatherdrew the assignment,&quot; Ron Fino says. The murder wentunsolved. Ron Fino says he never revealed his father'sinvolvement to outsiders until after Joe Fino died in 1984.   Secrets and subterfuge were part of growing up in a Mafiahousehold. When Ron Fino was five, his mother took him to NewYork's Attica state prison, where his father was serving timefor grand larceny. &quot;She told me Attica was an Army fort, andthat we were going to visit my father in the Army,&quot; Mr. Finorecalls.   When he was 11, he watched his father pay off twodetectives at a restaurant. &quot;I thought they were going toarrest my father,&quot; Mr. Fino says. &quot;But all they wanted wastheir cut.&quot;   Only gradually did it dawn on the boy that Joe Fino was amember of the Mafia. Once, young Ron came home from school ina novelty T-shirt inscribed: &quot;World Order of Mafia. Paid-UpMember.&quot; His father angrily demanded that he remove it. &quot;Icouldn't understand what he was mad about,&quot; Mr. Fino says.   By the time he was in high school, however, Ron Fino wasworking weekends in a Mafia gambling parlor, tending dicetables.   To the family, &quot;my father was a very caring man,&quot; Ron Finosays. &quot;He gave me money if I needed it. He never hit me -- Inever saw him hit anyone.&quot;   Through his father's connections, Ron Fino joined Local210 at age 18, working summers in construction whileattending college. He moved up quickly, and was elected Local210's operating head and business manager in 1973, at age 27.   Just as Ron Fino's star was rising, Joe Fino's began tosink. He was perceived by the mob as ineffective, and in 1972was removed as Buffalo chief by the Commission, the Mafia'sNew York-based ruling council. As Mafia leaders looked theother way, he began to lose customers to other bookies.   Two years later, he wound up on the losing side of afactional dispute that had split the Buffalo Mafia. Rumor hadit that he was to be killed. Ron Fino went to his father'shome and urged him to leave. &quot;He wouldn't budge,&quot; Mr. Finosays. &quot;He said to relax. He didn't leave the house for threedays. Then it all blew over. Later I was told by Sam Pierithat he saved my father's life.&quot;   The late Mr. Pieri, a reputed Mafia &quot;capo&quot; and member ofthe dominant faction, was an old friend who had recruited JoeFino into the Mafia. He invited Ron Fino to join as well --three years after Mr. Fino had turned informant. &quot;We weredriving back from Cleveland,&quot; Mr. Fino says, &quot;when Sam Pierisaid it would be easy to introduce me as a `friend of ours,'which meant, `Would you like to join?'&quot; Mr. Fino says thatneither he nor his father, who didn't want him entangled withthe mob, favored the idea. &quot;My father said, `Let me take careof it.' And I never heard any more about it.&quot;   By 1976, Joe Fino was reduced to taking handouts from hisson. When his father's four-bedroom suburban house burneddown, Ron Fino made the monthly payments on a new house. &quot;Allthe time he'd been in the mob, my father never had lifeinsurance, or medical insurance, and never provided for thefuture,&quot; Ron Fino says. &quot;Toward the end of his life, Ibrought him into Local 210. I got him work as a laborer. Isaid, `As a union member, you're entitled to a pension.' Iexplained to him the strength of legitimacy.&quot;   Ron Fino rode to election as business manager on a promiseof greater responsiveness to the local's 2,000 members. Butit soon became clear that his hands were tied. &quot;After twoweeks on the job, I was told by the {Mafia} bosses who to puton the union payroll and who would be involved in the benefitfunds,&quot; he says.   &quot;When deserving people came to me for jobs,&quot; Mr. Finoadds, &quot;I couldn't do anything for them.&quot; Instead of anequitable hiring hall, he says, &quot;there's a Who's Who list ofguys to be taken care of. If you're not on it, you're out ofluck.&quot; Mr. Fino insists that it was only after he was electedunion leader that he realized the full extent of mobinfluence.   The Washington-based Laborers International Union is awareof FBI allegations that the Buffalo local is mob-controlled,says Robert Connerton, general counsel of the international.&quot;If something is proven, the international is prepared to dosomething about it,&quot; he says. Mr. Connerton adds that asLocal 210 leader, Ron Fino &quot;probably did a good job. Myfeeling was he was very bright, very flaky, some sort ofshadowy character, always by himself.&quot;   Mr. Fino says that frustration over being a unionfigurehead in thrall to mob bosses led him, shortly after hiselection in 1973, to begin assisting the FBI. He wasrecruited by an acquaintance, an FBI agent to whom he hadearlier voiced his contempt for the mob. The FBI urged him tojoin the Mafia to better penetrate it. He refused, he says,fearing that the mob might order him to kill someone.   Even so, the FBI had a highly useful operative in Mr.Fino. In 1976, he met with Anthony D. Liberatore, thenbusiness agent for Cleveland Laborers Local 860. Mr.Liberatore, according to a 1988 U.S. Senate report, is a&quot;capo&quot; in the Cleveland Mafia.   &quot;Liberatore thought I was a member of the Buffalo family,so he spoke freely,&quot; Mr. Fino says. &quot;He told me the mob had aleak into the FBI office in Cleveland -- someone in the FBIfeeding stuff to them. I was concerned. It meant the mobwould have access to the FBI computer, which had a list ofinformants, including me.&quot;   Mr. Fino reported the leak to the FBI. In 1978, an FBIfile clerk and her husband pleaded guilty in Cleveland toreceiving $15,000 from Mr. Liberatore in exchange forconfidential FBI files, including a list of informants. (Mr.Fino's name apparently wasn't on the list.) The couplereceived five-year prison sentences. Mr. Liberatore,convicted in 1982 of racketeering and for his role in bribingthe FBI clerk, was recently released from prison.   Mr. Fino and his FBI contact met secretly, often at night,behind the Buffalo Bills' football stadium. &quot;I told my wifeit was business,&quot; Mr. Fino says. &quot;She accepted it.&quot;   Once, a Mafioso spotted him sitting in an FBI agent's carin broad daylight in downtown Buffalo. Mr. Fino was hauledbefore Sam Frangiamore, who at the time was Buffalo's Mafiachief, according to the FBI. &quot;I told Frangiamore I was comingout of the union hall when an FBI agent told me to get intohis car,&quot; Mr. Fino says. &quot;I said I thought I was underarrest, and that I told the FBI to go talk to my attorney.Frangiamore accepted my explanation.&quot;   Another time, the Mafia obtained FBI documents outliningthe bureau's surveillance of mob figures in Buffalo. Thedocuments, snatched from an FBI agent's unlocked car, werebrought to Local 210. Tipped by Mr. Fino, federal lawmenbarged into Local 210 and retrieved the papers.   To deflect suspicion from himself, Mr. Fino told Mafialeaders that the FBI knew of the documents' whereaboutsbecause they had bugged the union office. Knowing that themob would sweep his office, Mr. Fino bought a Radio Shacktransmitter and installed it in his office ceiling. The fakebug was duly uncovered.   The close calls took their toll, and by February 1988 RonFino was burned out. He wanted to resume a normal life. Hetold the FBI he would no longer serve as an informant andresigned his job at Local 210. &quot;The crime family urged me tostay in my job,&quot; Mr. Fino says. &quot;I had this good publicimage. They were afraid they'd have problems without me.&quot;   The Mafia might never have discovered he was an informantwere it not for the 1988 indictment of Joseph Rosato, a Local210 shop steward. Mr. Rosato, who denies wrongdoing, is setto stand trial in September on charges that he acceptedpayments from a construction employer for work not performed,a so-called no-show job scam.   &quot;The mob asked me to testify as a defense witness thatRosato didn't violate any law,&quot; Mr. Fino says. This put himin a bind, because he had implicated Mr. Rosato. &quot;So I keptducking them,&quot; Mr. Fino says. &quot;I was evasive. Then the mobdecided something was wrong.&quot;   After his ominous encounter at the VA Hospital coffeeshop, he asked to meet with Joseph Todaro Jr., the reputedboss of the Buffalo organized crime family and a former Local210 business agent. &quot;He refused to see me,&quot; Mr. Fino says.&quot;Then I got word from a relative of someone in the `family'that I had a `problem,' and I should get out of town.&quot;   Mr. Fino fled Buffalo in a rented black Thunderbird on themorning of Jan. 13, 1989, accompanied by a woman with whom hewas then romantically involved. A few weeks later, theBuffalo News reported that he had been an FBI informant.   He left behind a dying waste-removal company, which he hadfounded after leaving Local 210. James A. Ryding, a formerpresident of the company now being liquidated by a federalbankruptcy judge, blames its demise on Mr. Fino, who was itschief executive officer. &quot;He was a bad administrator,&quot; Mr.Ryding says. &quot;He just ignored things. And he couldn't say noto people.&quot; Mr. Fino blames the mob, which he says forced himto pad his payroll with unnecessary employees and controlledwhich contracts he could bid on. The FBI is investigating hischarges.   Mr. Fino's public exposure has been a boon for federalprosecutors: Now he is available to testify in open courtabout Mafia influence in the 500,000 member Laborers union.   This September, Mr. Fino will make his first appearance inhis home town as a prosecution witness, to testify againstMr. Rosato, the former Local 210 shop steward. Other Local210 officers implicated by Mr. Fino are John Catanzaro, aformer shop steward, and Leonard Falzone, the local's pensionfund administrator.   Last November, after pleading guilty in a no-show jobscam, Mr. Catanzaro received a 27-month prison sentence. Mr.Falzone was indicted last August in federal court in Buffaloon loan-sharking charges. His attorney denies the charges andthe allegations in an FBI affidavit that his client is amember of the Todaro crime family. No date has been set forhis trial.   So far, Mr. Fino's courtroom record is good. His initialappearance as a prosecution witness was last March inBinghamton, N.Y. He testified that Anthony F. (Guv)Guarnieri, a reputed &quot;capo&quot; in Pennsylvania's Bufalino crimefamily, exerted improper influence over Binghamton LaborersLocal 7. Mr. Guarnieri was convicted on RICO conspiracy andracketeering charges.   Mr. Fino also testified in the recent racketeering trialof John M. Riggi, the reputed Mafia boss of New Jersey. Mr.Riggi, a former business agent for Laborers Local 394 inElizabeth, N.J., was charged in Newark's federal court withshaking down contractors.   Mr. Fino stated that Buffalo Mafia leaders -- includinghis own father -- had told him that Mr. Riggi is a Mafioso.He also told the court that a third of his annual $72,000 FBIfee goes to his ex-wife, and that his current income doesn'tmatch his previous union compensation. &quot;I lost my family,&quot; hetestified. &quot;I lost my home, my way of life.&quot;   Mr. Riggi was convicted on seven counts of extortion andlabor bribery on July 20.   Mr. Fino's work as a prosecution witness has just begun.&quot;Before this is all over,&quot; he says, &quot;I expect to testify in50 criminal cases.&quot;   He eventually hopes to resettle in Europe, but worriesthat he may be murdered before he gets there. &quot;The fear nevergoes away,&quot; he says. He considered plastic surgery, but says,&quot;Doctors tell me that they can't change my features enough tomake me unrecognizable.&quot;   Meanwhile, he tries to maintain the semblance ofnormality. He takes a college course, works out in a gym andavoids fatty foods. But close relationships are out of thequestion. When a date asks him what he does for a living, &quot;Isay I'm a consultant to the Labor Department.&quot;   His life in hiding leaves him time for reflection. &quot;WouldI do it again? No. The price is too expensive,&quot; he says.&quot;Look at the pain it's cost my children. They have to defendme to their friends.&quot;   As always in his world, firm moral bearings are elusive.One night, he says, as he listened to his daughter weeprecriminations into the phone, &quot;I began to feel I was theevil one.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
