As the drug, an extract of Chinese cucumber, dripped into veins of Mr. Parr and his fellow volunteers, they talked of what they would do if it gave them a reprieve from acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    &quot;Nobody knows I have this {disease},&quot; Mr. Parr confided. &quot;I've got 14 people working for me, and if they find out, they'll leave me. I could never tell them.&quot;    &quot;Do you really believe that?&quot; Bob Barnett, a 36-year-old patient, recalls asking. &quot;I remember thinking, how sad . . . how wearing. He was very quiet, far away.&quot;    On Thursday, all of the volunteers except Mr. Parr went home to soothe their sore muscles. He had trouble urinating. He remained at the treatment center several hours longer and then went home, where he lapsed into a coma, and was rushed to Mount Zion Hospital. On Friday he awakened, but later vomited in his sleep, causing pneumonia. On Saturday at 10:30 a.m., after his breathing tubes were removed at his family's order, he died.    In one of the AIDS epidemic's bitter ironies, Mr. Parr's hope for privacy was dashed along with his hope for reprieve by his death in the federally unsanctioned human experiment. Was his death the consequence of heroism or of folly? Was it the disease, the drug or the politics and protocols of drug approval that forced him into the experiment and really killed him? The reasons are now being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration. Yet, whatever the findings, it is already apparent that the Compound Q experimenters and other therapeutic mavericks are helping push forward a revolution in American drug development. The issues of the speed of testing and access to drugs have been forced by a variety of AIDS activists. Although the Compound Q experiment has created crisis and confrontation, activists in other groups are harnessing the current sense of urgency to seek rapprochement with the medical establishment.    As a consequence, the development of experimental drugs to deal with AIDS seems likely to accelerate. Even more important, the drugs will be tested faster and on more patients. A laboratory-minded research elite, allied with the FDA, has become willing to relinquish some of its control over research and testing to what AIDS activists call the &quot;community&quot; -- AIDS sufferers around the country and the doctors and others who treat them.    By cooperating with community research and testing efforts -- which will receive federal grants -- the FDA and top researchers hope to enhance the safety and scientific validity of such efforts. More AIDS patients, for their part, will get faster and easier access to experimental drugs and will realize any benefits. They also will endure the risks. But as most of them see it, they have nothing to lose.    ---   Martin Delaney is one of the most radical of the rebels. Subdued and silver-haired, he doesn't look the part. But he is the architect of the unsanctioned Compound Q study. A Jesuit seminarian who fled the priesthood just before being ordained, the 44-year-old businessman became an activist in 1985. He founded Project Inform, a group pledged to fight medical bureaucracy by helping AIDS patients manage their own treatment.    It wasn't only being gay in a time of AIDS that made Mr. Delaney an activist. Other fires helped forge his radicalism. During the '60s, he was moved by Martin Luther King's brand of muscular religious activism. The son of a Chicago machinist loyal to the late Mayor Richard Daley -- he even posed for a boyhood picture on &quot;da Mayor's&quot; knee -- he had always been a conservative Democrat.    Then he was arrested during the brutal police crackdown on anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic convention. He was released, he says, only after a $600 family payoff to the police.    &quot;That was it for me and politics,&quot; he says. &quot;I had a deep distrust of authority, though I still wasn't a radical troublemaker. It wasn't in my gut.&quot; Not yet, anyway.    It took a medical crisis unrelated to AIDS to fix his course. Chronic hepatitis, then epidemic in the gay community, left Mr. Delaney frail and sallow. To all appearances he was dying of liver failure when he started treatment in a clinical trial of two new drugs at Stanford University in 1980. Though they saved his life, he says, the treatment riddled his limbs with permanent nerve damage that made him feel &quot;like my feet were on fire.    &quot;Was it worth it? Yes]&quot; he says, even though he now must take methadone, the potent heroin substitute, for his pain. He is angry that the treatment was abandoned as too toxic. &quot;I saw five people die of chronic hepatitis,&quot; he says. &quot;I of all people should understand {that} the decisions about risk and benefit should be made by doctor and patient, not by some pinheaded bureaucrat in Washington.&quot;    So when the AIDS epidemic struck, he says, &quot;I was ready for a fight.&quot;    Still, amid a fractious chorus of desperate activists, Mr. Delaney's voice seemed cool and moderate. It won a measure of trust from a top federal health figure, Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. Mr. Delaney published news of popular if unproven remedies such as ribavirin and isoprinosine. He chided regulators. He debated FDA Commissioner Frank Young on ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; in 1987, and watched as &quot;my clients headed for the hills,&quot; all but collapsing his business in producing videotapes for electronics training. But his Project Inform grew to six hotlines and 60 volunteers.    When scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, and Genelabs Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., published a test-tube study of Compound Q this year, the gay community was euphoric. In the laboratory, the compound killed infected cells and spared healthy ones.    Guerrilla importers didn't wait for a study at San Francisco General Hospital. Men gulped crude extract of cucumber; seizure, coma and death were reported. To discourage such dangerous self-treatment, Project Inform says it joined with the importers. It enlisted longtime AIDS-drug courier Jim Corti, a Los Angeles nurse, to obtain the purified drug from Shanghai and mail it from Tokyo to the U.S.    Mr. Delaney recruited San Francisco pediatrician Lawrence Waites and immunologist Alan Levin, an academic with a history of selling unproven biologics among other drugs for AIDS. They planned a &quot;treatment group&quot; of 42 patients in four cities. Skipping the cautious, graduated doses of the classic safety trial, they leaped straight to chemotherapeutic-dose levels like those used in China to treat tumors. Along with early reports of lowered virus levels in the blood, the group experienced a death, a suicide, and several instances of dementia in patients with prior brain infection.    &quot;It was a mistake,&quot; says Dr. Fauci of the NIH. While granting Mr. Delaney's good intentions, he warns, &quot;If people feel they can go off and do whatever they want, the potential for disaster is great. Sooner or later, a disaster will happen.&quot;    Other researchers were even more outspoken. Paul Volberding, AIDS chief at San Francisco General Hospital, condemned the action as a disservice to patients. &quot;Bad medicine,&quot; said his colleague Jim Kahn, who is running the official Compound Q study at the hospital. New York AIDS specialist Joseph Sonnabend says, &quot;It's dangerous. They're experimenting on human beings.&quot;    A wounded but adamant Mr. Delaney replies: &quot;They just won't look at the risk of doing nothing. They ought to scream about the pace of drug development, not attack us. When is this country going to start acting like there's an epidemic going on?&quot; People with AIDS were using the compound anyway, he says, but in unsupervised and dangerous fashion, making it necessary to offer supervised access to the drug. Moreover, he insists, his findings -- that Compound Q could be toxic to AIDS patients with brain infection -- could serve as an early warning to others.    &quot;Yes,&quot; counters Ellen Cooper, the FDA's antiviral products chief, &quot;but at what cost? The maximum dose in safety studies usually stops well short of death.&quot;    For the most part, however, Mr. Delaney's clients hold with his view that, since 150 AIDS patients die each day without access to the most experimental of drugs, they should be able to choose their risks. &quot;We're unwitting victims of the system,&quot; says one of them, Bob Barnett. &quot;They don't want to give us something toxic that might kill us, when we already have something in us, a virus, that's very likely to do it anyway.&quot;    Mr. Barnett, a former radio-station manager, says the infusions made him as stiff and sore as he would feel after a bout of flu. Then he says his energy level improved, though his blood work is worse, with more anemia and fewer T-cells.    &quot;I can't say I have faith that this drug works,&quot; he says. &quot;But if I wait for the medical research industry to come up with answers, it won't be for me.&quot;    Never a gambler before, he says AIDS has made him a risk-taker. &quot;Life is short,&quot; he says. &quot;Who am I to fool myself and think I'll live 40 or 50 years, retire, and drive around Arizona in my Airstream trailer?&quot;    For Tandy Belew, a 41-year-old graphic artist with a degree of brain infection, the treatment was very rough going. After he took Compound Q, his AIDS symptoms, which had receded, returned. Then he became utterly disoriented until he ceased all drugs. &quot;I was gone,&quot; he says. &quot;I went to the bathroom in the kitchen. I kept asking what time it was, and hummed the theme from 'Indiana Jones.'&quot;    Robert Pitman, a 48-year-old job counselor, is thrilled to see the virus levels in his blood plunge to one-fifth their former level. But the infusions left him &quot;very tired, my muscles sore and achy, and I don't stand up as easily,&quot; he says.    Mr. Delaney maintains that his experimental therapy rests on solid legal ground. &quot;We're not promoting anything, not selling anything,&quot; he says. &quot;There was no smuggling in this, nothing illegal.&quot; Project Inform acted as courier between the U.S. source -- Mr. Corti -- and patients who had requested a personal supply of the drug, which they then took to Drs. Levin and Waites for administration.    The FDA has been tolerant of importers who limit themselves to bringing in personal, three-month supplies of a drug and who eschew promotion and profiteering. But the FDA might constrain imports if its investigation concludes that Compound Q is too toxic. &quot;If it's found unsafe, we can put out an import alert and stop {a drug},&quot; says Stuart Nightingale, the agency's associate commissioner for health affairs. &quot;That's an option, but we have to await the outcome of the investigation.&quot; In general, the FDA hasn't meddled much with the AIDS self-help movement. Even as Mr. Delaney and his patients await the outcome of the investigation into Compound Q, AIDS &quot;buyers' clubs&quot; are thriving. They offer a menu of imported and domestic herbs, pharmaceuticals and food supplements to roughly 4,000 clients in New York and San Francisco alone.    This strikes many physicians as rash. But spaces in orthodox clinical trials are still far too few. New York physician Nathaniel Pier says, &quot;I see eight to 10 antibody-positive patients a day,&quot; many with no option but so-called alternative treatments. Says William Case, executive director of the People with AIDS (PWA) Coalition of New York: &quot;Frustration forces people to experiment.&quot;    ---   A ride on an industrial elevator to the fourth floor of an old building on West 26th Street in New York brings you to the office of the PWA Health Group, a buyers' club. Here the group stocks a refrigerator with AL-721, an egg lipid concoction. Stacks of red, white and blue Japanese packing boxes hold three-month supplies of dextran sulfate, the Japanese antihypertensive still used by some AIDS patients despite a recent San Francisco study that has led many academics to conclude it doesn't work.    The group's executive director, Derek Hodel, tanned and crewcut, makes a good advertisement for its services. He says the group sells at cost plus overhead. The group forwards individual orders of various drugs obtainable abroad to agents who ship them via Federal Express or DHL. A hot product is hypericin, a German antidepressant derived from saint-john's-wort, an herbal plant that has attracted interest because of recent test-tube studies. The group sells &quot;German enzymes,&quot; pancreatic products similar to those made notorious as unproven cancer remedies.    &quot;We recently started obtaining fluconazole, a Pfizer product approved all over Europe and Japan, for cryptococcal meningitis,&quot; Mr. Hodel says. He calls it &quot;scandalous&quot; that it has taken so long for the drug to be used here.    An emaciated client wanders in. Mr. Hodel directs him to a colleague for help, and resumes. &quot;In fiscal 1989, we did just under $1 million in sales,&quot; he says. &quot;But we'd love to see our role diminish&quot; through community trials or increased distribution of drugs.    The drive for patient participation, the pleas for urgency and access to drugs, the ad hoc experiments and protests now are having a palpable impact on the once-leisurely pace of American research.    &quot;If people weren't sitting in at FDA, and chaining themselves to the wall of Burroughs Wellcome Co. {the maker of AZT}, none of this would be happening,&quot; acknowledges one chagrined scientist. &quot;This is the way revolutions happen,&quot; says Jerome Groopman, a researcher at Harvard University and the New England Deaconness Hospital in Boston. &quot;There's a vanguard, quite radical and often off-the-mark. Then there's a process of moderation with more reasonable solutions. It's causing a revolution in experimental trials.&quot;    ---   As Mr. Hodel closed shop on a recent Friday night, a summit meeting of sorts was taking place 90 blocks uptown in a steamy room at Columbia University. Most of those attending were either activists or established institutional research authorities. They came in the spirit of rapprochement, to bridge the gulf between patient and scientist, between rigid scientific protocols and unrestrained self-medication.    The meeting was called by the Community Research Initiative of New York and the County Community Consortium of San Francisco. Both groups are committed to bringing officially sanctioned research to the grass-roots level, involving local doctors and patients in it.    For years there had been sniping between the activists, on one hand, and research officials from the National Institutes of Health and regulators from the FDA, on the other. Now, says White House physician Burton Lee, there was to be &quot;a marriage of the brain trust with the people in the trenches.&quot;    Members of an activist group called the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) had once passed out purple Kool Aid as symbolic cyanide to researchers they accused of committing Jonestown-style murder on people with AIDS by not increasing the pace and scope of research and testing. Now they sat studiously listening to arcane talks on how to get solid scientific statistics and how to achieve tax-free status for community drug-trial groups.    &quot;FDA is still the enemy,&quot; said William Cooper, medical director of San Francisco's Community Research Alliance, another grass-roots group. &quot;But this meeting is superb. It seeks a common ground between conservative doctors and advocates. They don't speak the same language.&quot;    Martin Delaney's work in San Francisco was never far from the minds of those attending the meeting. Michael Callen, an AIDS patient who founded the Community Research Initiative, said he respected Mr. Delaney but added, &quot;I can't countenance the principle that people can conduct an unregulated trial of Q. It is a poison.&quot; The answer isn't unsanctioned trials, he said, but community research in cooperation with the FDA.    Within months, Dr. Fauci said, the NIH will award $6 million in grant money to community-based trials, and it has asked President Bush to double that amount next year. &quot;Sometimes the design of a classical drug trial seems very cold and aloof,&quot; Dr. Fauci acknowledged. He said his recent proposal to distribute new drugs to patients who can't qualify for official trials, and his initiative to involve doctors and patients in local communities, could go far toward broadening access to experimental drugs and putting people before protocols.    Others suggested the mobilization of a kind of domestic Peace Corps to administer community trials. Mathilde Krim of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, which sponsored the meeting, said community trials were the missing link between lofty research institutions and the myriad poor and desperate patients.    Dr. Fauci has put his reputation on the line by endorsing the ability of community trials to produce drug studies sufficiently reliable for the FDA to consider in drug approval. But there is a successful precedent: Community research on the drug aerosol pentamidine as a preventative for the often fatal AIDS pneumonia PCP.    More such advances are needed. &quot;The best thing you can do for us,&quot; Dr. Fauci exhorted the crowd, &quot;is to succeed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
