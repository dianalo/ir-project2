The process ofdecommissioning some platforms may well begin in a few years' time. Itis envisaged that due to the large water depths involved, explosive cuttingwill be a prime process for application, due mainly to its effectivenessand amenability for use with ROVs. This paper presents a general discussionon explosive cutting for offshore applications, in particular platformremoval. The use of linear shaped charges is highlighted and referenceis made to new alternative techniques presently under consideration forthe task.</TEXT></DOC>
