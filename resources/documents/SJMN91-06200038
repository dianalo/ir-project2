Most people succumb to sports injuries because they do too much toofast. And many people drop out because they get bored or can't cope withinjuries.;    I see many patients who have injured themselves because theydon't do what all Boy Scouts are trained to do: be prepared.;    My advice toserious competitors and beginners alike is to set realistic goals and definewhat you want to get out of your sports and exercise programs. Then stick withit and be patient, or else you'll be a patient. Don't expect to run a 10K ifyou've never run more than a few miles.;    The trick is to build up slowlybut surely, and be consistent. If you think you're a serious competitor andthis advice doesn't apply to you, think again. Overtraining is the downfall ofeven the most serious athletes.;    So, before you head out the door, askyourself these questions:;    (check) Which exercise is best for you, andwhich do you enjoy the most?;    (check) Do you like the solitude ofexercising alone and communing with nature, or do you get your juices flowingby listening to loud music and doing aerobics with a large group of people?;   (check) Do you have the skills to get going right away, or will you needtraining advice and lessons? If you do need lessons, it'll take you longer toget into the swing of things?;    (check) Will you need to buy equipment likea racing bike (up to $1,000) or do you prefer the simplicity of a pair ofrunning shoes (less than $100)?;    (check) Will you be exercising at night,when you get home from work, or will it be at the crack of dawn? That'simportant because you won't typically go biking after dark or go windsurfinguntil the wind blows strong in the afternoon.;    Now that you've gone throughthis checklist, you're just about ready to go. The best medical advice I cangive you is to use common sense and a few simple rules.;    Warm up by walkingbriskly for 5 to 10 minutes. Do stretching exercises for your arms, back andlegs -- the major muscle groups. All bookstores have a variety of books onstretching.;    Begin slowly, ease into the regime, and build up steadily. Insports medicine terms, this means increments per week. For example, if you'rerunning two miles a day for five days a week (10 miles a week), you shouldincrease 10 percent to 11 miles the following week.;    The same rule appliesto biking, hiking, or just about any other sport. Remember, this 10 percentguideline is a golden rule in sports medicine. Violating this principle is thesingle biggest cause of sports and exercise-related injuries.;    So if you'drather be on the track than in a doctor's waiting room, and if you'd rather bedoing laps rather than physical therapy, then set your goals and be patient.The rewards of exercise come slowly but last a lifetime.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dr. Warren Scott column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910718  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  578  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 18, 199100200038,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
