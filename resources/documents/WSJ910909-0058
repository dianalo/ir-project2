Its name wasMillionaire, and the publication eventually went bankrupt,stiffing free-lance writers along the way.   By contrast, the 1990s are starting with major and minorpublishers backing a number of magazines that are decidedlydown-market. Instead of shining a spotlight on ritz andglitz, such new titles as CrimeBeat, Parent's Digest and aNational Enquirer sibling called Soap Opera are focusing onthe practical and the proletariat. They serve up real newsfor real folks, and they prefer to hang out at thegrocery-store counter than compete with the likes of a VanityFair or Esquire at newsstand racks.</LP><TEXT>   CrimeBeat -- &quot;the news magazine of crime,&quot; as publisher 54Corp. dubs it -- is the brainchild of editor T.E.D. Klein, ahorror novelist and former editor of the defunct TwilightZone magazine. The new monthly, which has just hitconvenience-store and supermarket-checkout racks, blends theclassic retelling of crime stories with the yuppie paranoiaof &quot;it could happen to you, too.&quot;   The first issue carries articles titled &quot;Don't be avictim] Tips from the experts&quot; and &quot;Auto theft, will your carbe next?&quot; The auto theft story includes a centerfold &quot;CrimeMap&quot; with a state-by-state analysis of auto theft. (Bostonhas the most, Honolulu the least, and if you drive a PontiacGrand Am you had better go check the parking lot.)   The magazine largely steers clear of the lurid,near-pornographic focus of old pulp detective magazines,though serial murderer/cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer will make itinto the next issue. Advertising, not surprisingly, is comingslowly. But CrimeBeat has, besides getting the expectedadvertisements from home-security companies, attracted adsfor crime books from Houghton Mifflin Co. and for the Foxnetwork's true-crime show, &quot;America's Most Wanted.&quot;   Reader demand has been strong for CrimeBeat, says StevenFishman, vice chairman of 54 Corp. He is pumping up thedistribution to 150,000 copies from 100,000 for the nextissue, and by December he plans to ship copies overseas forsale in the U.K.   CrimeBeat's survival isn't assured, but some ad executivesbelieve it is on to something big. &quot;The trend is away fromfantasy-based magazines or `Lifestyles of the Rich andFamous' magazines,&quot; says David Verklin, corporate mediadirector at agency Hal Riney andamp; Partners in San Francisco.&quot;More publications have to have a utilitarian function ifthey are going to appeal to agencies and advertisers.&quot;   One might think a tonier environment would be better foran advertiser. But Mr. Verklin says, &quot;I've been burned somany times. I took out ad pages in magazines that soundedgood but never made it,&quot; including Men's Life, Memories andWigwag; all folded. &quot;The days of people coming in hereselling a high concept are over for me.&quot;   In part, CrimeBeat trades off the large and diversetelevision audience for such gritty prime-time &quot;reality&quot;shows as &quot;Cops,&quot; &quot;Top Cops,&quot; and &quot;America's Most Wanted&quot; (themagazine even serves up critical reviews). In a similar way,Soap Opera magazine springs directly from the afternoon showsthat are watched by millions.   &quot;Everyone is looking to figure out the trick, and SoapOpera and CrimeBeat are vulturing off TV, looking for thatlow and large demographic audience,&quot; says James N. Richman,president of Bottomline Group Inc., a magazine consultant.   Set to be introduced as a national weekly Oct. 1, SoapOpera will compete directly with K-III Holdings Inc.'s SoapOpera Weekly and Soap Opera Digest, and with CapitalCities/ABC Inc.'s Episodes. &quot;We know the soaps is a crowdedcategory, but we can offer something the others don't,&quot; saysPeter Callahan, chairman of Enquirer/Star Group Inc., whichpublishes the National Enquirer and is owned by MacfaddenHoldings Inc.   For instance, Soap Opera will focus more heavily on theprivate lives of soap stars, using a saucier approachborrowed from its sister National Enquirer. But for now,Enquirer executives say the new magazine will &quot;be gentle&quot; onstars.   Soap Opera has a tremendous head start. It will haveunmatched access to the nation's supermarket checkoutsthrough an in-house distributor that peddles the massiveweekly circulations of the National Enquirer (3.7 million)and the Star (3.2 million).   Though Parent's Digest is far more cerebral than theothers, it proudly targets the thrifty. The debut cover forthe Sept. 3 issue blares: &quot;Over $300 worth of material frombooks, magazines and home videos.&quot; It forgos fashion spreadsof hip kids in perfect clothes. Instead, it lists articlesranging from a profile of Dr. Spock to &quot;How to boost yourchild's self-esteem&quot; and &quot;How to talk to kids about sex.&quot;   Parent's Digest, a spin-off of Meredith Corp.'s Ladies'Home Journal, was first planned as a once-a-year compendiumof articles and information from elsewhere. But publisherDonna Galotti says the response from advertisers was soenthusiastic that she has decided to publish twice a year.They bought up a surprising 57 pages in the first issuewithout so much as a dummy version to inspect.   This doesn't mean the decade is being handed over to JoeSix-pack and his blue-collar buddies. Hearst Corp. recentlylaunched Countryside, a tony, successful magazine for theRalph Lauren set. But new, upscale titles are so scarce thatfinding one can require looking beyond the realm of magazinepublishers. A real highbrow number is in development, calledCivilization. The publisher: the Library of Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
