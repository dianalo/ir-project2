Generale d'Electricite and ITT Corp. are expected to sign a formal agreement today in Brussels, Belgium, creating the world's second-largest telecommunications company.    According to CGE officials, the agreement -- the broad outlines of which were announced five months ago -- will not include Telefonica S.A. of Spain. CGE officials said the state-owned Spanish telecommunications company, which initially was to take about a 6% stake in the venture, isn't likely to join at this stage.    But sources familiar with the accord said a new minority partner, state-owned Credit Lyonnais of France, will be a party to the agreement with a stake of about 2%. As expected, Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian banking group, also will join in the venture with a 6% stake.    According to trade reports here, ITT's 24% interest in Standard Telephones andamp; Cables PLC of Britain won't be included in the agreement, and that will reduce the amount CGE will pay ITT. Officials wouldn't comment on the reports. CGE and its European partners were to pay ITT $1.1 billion cash to take control of its telecommunications activities. CGE itself will pay $600 million to $900 million.    Telefonica's difficulties with the venture, according to CGE officials, center on Spanish demands for an active managerial role despite its small stake. The company also sought sole responsibility for restructuring ITT's two loss-making subsidiaries in Spain in which Telefonica has a 25% interest.    Telefonica officials said that their demands haven't been met, but that the company hasn't made a final decision on whether to join the venture. &quot;It's not very serious to think that Telefonica will sign in the next 48 hours,&quot; a CGE official said. &quot;But they could take a small stake in three or six months if we resolve our problems with them.&quot;    Under the accord, CGE and ITT are to merge their telecommunications and some fiber-optics cable activities in the new venture, to be incorporated in the Netherlands. CGE would own between 51% and 59% of the new company, depending on its final configuration, ITT would own between 35% and 37%, with Societe Generale owning 6%.    The agreement would give CGE the critical size it believes it must attain to compete in the world telecommunications market, where American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. is now the largest player. It also allow ITT, under Chairman Rand V. Araskog, to reduce its interest in the capital-intensive telecommunications field and focus more on its hotels, finance, insurance and other service activities.    The joint venture will have annual sales of about $12 billion, 150,000 employees world-wide, activities in 75 countries, 12% of the world market and about 45% of the European market for public switching equipment.    Despite these impressive statistics, CGE appears to have had trouble finding other shareholders to join in the venture to lessen its financial burden. CGE reportedly had approached several West German partners but they expressed little interest in being only silent partners.    CGE and ITT officials have insisted that finding partners wouldn't prevent completion of the transaction on schedule. &quot;Closing the deal with ITT is one thing, European participation is another,&quot; an official said. CGE Chairman Pierre Suard said recently that the company &quot;isn't anxiously seeking&quot; partners because it can afford to finance the transaction alone.    But to make financing the transaction easier, CGE officials hope the company soon will be privatized so they can tap capital markets for fresh funds. French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur recently said that the government would return an unspecified industrial company to the private sector in the first half of 1987, and CGE officials hope he was talking about their company.    ---   ATandamp;T to Buy 2 ITT Units   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. said it agreed to purchase two ITT Corp. communications units that provide long-distance telephone service to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.    Terms weren't disclosed. According to the agreement, however, ATandamp;T will purchase all the stock of ITT's All America Cables andamp; Radio Inc., which services Puerto Rico, and ITT Communications Inc. Virgin Islands.    The agreement is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
