I sound like I'm waltzing with LawrenceWelk, but in reality I'm doing aerobics Tuesday and Thursday mornings at theSanta Clara Senior Citizens Center.;   I'm right in step with physicalfitness. Not the wild Jazzercize stuff. This is low-impact aerobics forseniors, just the right pace for my mended heart.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GASP! AEROBICS, GARDENING HAVE A LOT IN COMMON  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Update  </MEMO><TEXT>     My 20 fellow aerobic-ees and I are trying to improve our cardiovascularsystems, our muscles and our breathing without jolting our joints. We are alsosweating a lot. Our instructor Beverly Myers says this is a good sign.;   I amstruck by the similarity between low-impact aerobics and gardening. Raking,weeding, hoeing and other typical garden chores may not have the same benefitsas running a 10-K race, but they are in the same ballpark as low-impactaerobics.;   And it's more fun than just standing in a room &quot;exercising.&quot; Inthe garden, I'm ready to dance, baby.;   I do the fancy aerobic foot work,dipping and bending and prancing around the yard, counting one-two-three-clap,one-two-three-clap and hoping my neighbors find me amusing.;   I keep my backstraight and bend at the hips and knees to reach for the garden hose . . . usemy leg muscles instead of back and arm muscles to hoist the containers . . .turn my whole body instead of twisting my back as I prune and pluck and sprayand sweep. Good bye, cholesterol; hello, healthy.;   The Sky Stretch maneuveris a good example. This is a warmup exercise in which I stand straight withfeet spread and lift my arms over my head as though I am stretching for thesky -- or picking fruit off the trees or pruning the hard-to-reach branches orany one of a number of other gardening jobs.;   Another one I like is theWindmill Stretch. The idea is to bend over at the waist and try to touch myleft hand to the ceiling while grasping my left ankle with my right hand, thenalternative with the left hand-right ankle.;   I bend my knees (cheat, cheat)and go at a slow but steady pace. But I do this over the flower beds, yankingup another weed with each windmill whirl. I can get quite a pile of weeds with20 windmills.;   Let's not forget shoveling. It turns out that shoveling, asapplied to turning the compost pile, has the same aerobic benefit as walkingat 4 mph or bicycling at 10 mph the experts say. So, my compost pile has beenturned and turned and turned some more. My husband says I'm wearing it outturning it so much. Never mind, I've lost four pounds.;   It is myunderstanding that it takes eight minutes of sustained movement to burn up 100calories, and it's the same results whether I'm jogging, biking, walking orgardening.;   The other evening I was in the front yard hunting down snails inthe flower bed. For the snail hunt I use leg lunges to the front, similar to afencing position.;   But I've put a bit more action into it, so it's more likea step-step-STAMP maneuver. Each &quot;stamp,&quot; of course, means the crunchy end fora snail. I wiped out the snail population, got my heart rate up, and burned300 calories! A very satisfying evening.;   Then I noticed my next-doorneighbor watching me over the fence, no doubt thinking, &quot;Poor Joanie, she'sfinally flipped out.&quot;;   &quot;Laugh it up, kiddo,&quot; I thought. &quot;I'm more physicallyfit than you.&quot;;   See you at aerobics!  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Joan Jackson  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910905  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  609  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 5, 199100249054,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
