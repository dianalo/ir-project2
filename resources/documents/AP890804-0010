Also today, the government declined to comment on a report thatsenior leader Deng Xiaoping is seriously ill with prostate cancer.The official Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong office described thereport as a mere rumor.   An unsigned commentary in the Communist Party newspaper People'sDaily said China will continue to respect its intellectuals'knowledge and talent, even though some participated in the recentpro-democracy movement that the government calls a``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''   ``China needs a strong intellectual force for modernization. ...We should thoroughly implement Deng Xiaoping's policy to `respectknowledge, respect talent' and use intellectuals to achieve themodernization goal,'' it said.   The crackdown ended a period of relatively free politicaldebate. Chinese now are urged to report on friends and family andmust participate in political study sessions reminiscent of theultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.   The commentary called those who took part in the studentmovement ``scum'' and ``enemies of the party and of the people.''It said, ``It is in the interest of the workers, peasants andintellectuals to punish them.''   ``Those who were under the influence of the wave of bourgeoisliberalism ... will elevate their understanding and continue tomake contributions'' to China's modernization program, thecommentary said.   Fang Lizhi, the dissident who evaded arrest by seeking refuge atthe U.S. Embassy, has been relieved of his position on the AcademicDegrees Committee under the State Council, China's Cabinet, is nolonger qualified to tutor doctoral students, Xinhua News Agencyreported.   Fang, who entered the U.S. Embassy with his wife shortly afterthe June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, already had beenrelieved of his posts at the Natural Dialectics Research Societybut apparently still retains his main job at the BeijingObservatory.   Several other dissident intellectuals also have been removedfrom peripheral positions.   The government issued arrest warrants for Fang and his wife,professor of physics Li Shuxian, for allegedly inciting thepro-democracy protests, and has demanded that the U.S. Embassy turnthem over to Chinese authorities.   China's Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the report byJapan's Jiji Press today that Deng is seriously ill with prostatecancer.   Quoting unidentified Chinese sources, the Japanese news agencysaid the senior Chinese leader's condition had suddenly worsened afew days ago. Emergency medical personnel were sent to care for himat his summer resort near Bo Hai Bay, east of Beijing, Jiji said.   An employee at the Foreign Ministry's Information Departmentsaid he had received many queries about Deng's health but couldrespond. There was no answer tonight at the Communist Party's newsoffice.   Deng was last seen in public June 9, when national televisionshowed him congratulating top army officers on having ended thepro-democracy protests. He spoke in a strong voice and appearedmore alert and healthy than he had for some months. He is widelybelieved to suffer from prostate problems, and over the past fewyears there have been periodic reports he is very ill or dying.   The Beijing Daily today said the army has chosen 36 people totravel around the country to ``tell the whole nation how they,bearing the fate of the party and the country, protected thesocialist system'' by helping troops crack down on the popularstudent movement.   The group includes soldiers, armed police and a woman who saidthey helped 164 soldiers hide from angry protesters.   The move is part of a campaign to publicize the official versionof the events of June 3-4, when troops marched through Beijing andfired on unarmed civilians to drive student protesters fromTiananmen Square.   Xinhua has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and thatthousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly1,000 were injured.   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said thedeath toll may have been as high as 3,000.</TEXT></DOC>
