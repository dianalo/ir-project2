Culminating bearish OPEC-eve trading world-wide, the January-delivery crude-oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost ground for the third session in a row, closing at $18.08, down 17 cents and off almost $1 from Friday's high. On the spot, or noncontract, market, prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 15 cents, to $18.10.    Futures trading, which wasn't active most of the day, picked up furiously at the close on surprisingly aggressive selling accentuated by technical factors, analysts said. There's &quot;a lot of pessimism regarding OPEC's ability to come up with something smart,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc., Chicago.    Traders said crude prices were clearly being pushed toward $18 a barrel and were literally &quot;saved by the bell.&quot;    &quot;The market took a real hit right at the close,&quot; said Chris McCormack, a broker at E.D.andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc., New York. &quot;The market has no confidence in OPEC. I think traders believe . . . OPEC won't be able to come up with anything to support prices.&quot;    Depressing the market, among other things, was a statement by Iran's oil minister that Iran will &quot;under no circumstances&quot; accept an oil-production quota that equals that of its enemy Iraq.    Analysts said that besides such OPEC news, the market was hurt by the expectation that weekly U.S. oil-inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, released each Tuesday after the market closes, would again be price depressing. Late yesterday, institute statistics showed a 3.8-million-barrel rise, to almost 128.5 million barrels, of U.S. heating-oil and other distillate stocks -- still 20 million barrels below last year.    U.S. heating-oil futures slipped 0.86 cent a gallon yesterday on the New York Merc, to 54.07 cents a gallon for January delivery -- a drop of 2.2 cents this week.    Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., New York, said: &quot;Basically, this is probably the most bearish we can remember the market being this close to an OPEC meeting. Normally, sellers aren't this aggressive because OPEC might do something (to boost prices). But the consensus is that OPEC will not.&quot;    Other analysts say they've learned never to count out the 13-member oil cartel. As Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York, put it: &quot;OPEC has always worked well when in a crisis situation. And this definitely looks like a crisis.&quot; He said falling prices might force the cartel to come up with a price-supporting agreement in Vienna.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat-futures prices slipped amid trade reports that the U.S. Agriculture Department rejected low bids from the Soviet Union and China to buy subsidized U.S. wheat, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. The sales are subject to approval by the department, which compensates exporters who sell expensive U.S. wheat to targeted countries at lower world prices. The Soviets offered to buy 700,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat while the Chinese bid for 300,000 metric tons, Mr. Lespinasse said. Wheat prices were also depressed by news that wheat exports last week were 16.1 million bushels, about five million bushels lower than expected by traders. Corn prices closed lower while soybean contracts finished mixed. News that flooding might have damaged Malaysian palm-oil production helped boost the January-delivery soybean-oil contract to a life-of-contract high before easing lower.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle-futures prices fell. An early rally fizzled when it attracted selling by commission houses and traders concerned about large cattle supplies in the nation's feed lots. Prices could be under pressure today following news that about 135,000 cattle were slaughtered Tuesday, which was higher than expected. That influx could pressure wholesale prices, said Philip Stanley, a livestock analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities, Chicago. &quot;It pumps more product into a market that doesn't really need it at this time,&quot; he said. Hog futures prices rose.    COCOA: Futures prices showed little change following Monday's plunge. March-delivery cocoa ended $7 a metric ton lower at $1,743. Prices moved in a mixed pattern, first rising as much as $13 as some bargain hunting followed Monday's decline and then falling as much as $19 below the previous close, before recovering. The market appeared to be absorbing the collapse of last weekend's International Cocoa Agreement talks to stabilize the market, one analyst said. Despite the fact that surpluses are expected to prevail during the current season that began Oct. 1, there is concern that a tightness of good-quality cocoa beans may develop early next year as the result of drought during Brazil's growing season, the analyst said. Brazil is currently harvesting its main crop. </TEXT></DOC>
