A large mass difference, (DELTAm/gamma)/sub B//sub s/ greater than or equal to 5, is predicted in theKobayashi-Maskawa (KM) model with three generations of quarks. This predictionfollows from two factors. The first is the ARGUS collaboration reportof a large B/sub d/ - anti B/sub d/ mixing, (DELTA m/gamma)/sub B//subd/ approxi.1. The second is the unitarity of the 3 x 3 KM matrix. Theprediction does not depend whether the KM model is relevant for CP violation.Thus, a much smaller (DELTA m/gamma)/sub B//sub s/ andless;andless; 5 would indicatenew physics. An argument for an observable lifetime difference will begiven. This report discusses time-dependent ways to extract the massdifference and lifetime difference of the neutral B/sub s/ system.</TEXT></DOC>
