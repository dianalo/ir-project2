Constitution: Althoughthe conventional BWR type reactor has an inherent safety, since the turbineis directly operated by the steams heated in the reactor core, the turbinebuildings have to be regarded as in the controlled area. In the presentinvention, a steam generator and a secondary circuit are used for theheat removal from the reactor core. Since the steams supplied to theturbine thus contain no radioactivity, the turbine buildings are putout of the controlled area and the working efficiency can be improvedsignificantly. Since the steam generator is incorporated within a pressurevessel, the result upon LOCA can significantly be moderated. (Kamimura,M.).</TEXT></DOC>
