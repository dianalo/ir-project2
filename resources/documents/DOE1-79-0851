In North and South Dakota, four lignite-firedpower plants utilize cyclone boilers that convert most of the ash intomolten slag that could be fabricated directly into mineral wool. Botha pilot-scale cupola using coke as fuel, as well as an electric arc furnace,have been used to melt various cyclone boiler slags, as well as dry scrubberash and gasifier ash. Mineral wool was made using a spinning disk andby directing compressed air through holes in double blow caps. For propermelt flow and fiberization the acid/base ratio should be in the rangeof 0.8 to 1.2. Using the blow caps wool was made that was very comparableto commercial wool with respect to shot content, fiber diameter, andcompressibility. A summary is presented showing the effects of variationin chemical composition as well as the method of fabricating the wool.The economics are presented involving production of mineral wool fromlignite ash. 10 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
