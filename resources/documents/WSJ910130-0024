But that output is expectedto recover soon and the U.S. is halving the amount of oilbeing sold from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Leading OPEC monitors estimate output will be down inJanuary from December by 300,000 to as much as one millionbarrels a day, largely because the war has reduced tankertraffic in the Gulf, but industry officials insist thatwhatever the size of the decline it is likely to have littleimpact on world oil markets. Supplies remain plentiful, andOPEC's output is expected to recover at least partially inFebruary, barring further war disruptions.</LP><TEXT>   In Washington, the Energy Department reduced the size ofits auction of strategic reserve oil to 17.3 million barrelsfrom 33.75 million barrels because of White House pressure.The department plans to announce the changes, along withwinning bidders, today. Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moorealso said the other nations in the International EnergyAgency may be making similar cutbacks to an earliercoordinated release arrangement.   Besides the reduced tanker traffic, some of the Januarycutbacks in OPEC output may have occurred because the world'scommercial network is so choked with oil, particularlyless-desired heavier grades. The importance of the SPRauction has lessened because of the glut in the market andthe sharp drop in oil prices since war began.   Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd., aGeneva-based firm that monitors OPEC production for itsclients, including some OPEC members, estimates OPECproduction fell by four million barrels a day in the thirdweek of January from 24.3 million a day in the first half ofthe month. After the outbreak of war, &quot;there were 101problems affecting shipping in the Gulf, from missiles tomines to insurance rates,&quot; Mr. Gerber said.   Production has rebounded in the fourth week of the month,said Mr. Gerber, who figures the average production forJanuary will still be some 300,000 barrels a day lower thanfor December.   Most of the January declines were in Saudi Arabia andIran, whose chief export terminals are within the war zone,Mr. Gerber said. Both have since made such alternate shippingarrangements as shuttle services to transfer sites furtheraway from the zone. The huge oil spill off Kuwait is also notexpected to affect supplies, because Kuwaiti oil has beenembargoed since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion.   Saudi petroleum officials have maintained recently thattheir output was down only briefly to 7.3 million barrels aday when the war began before rebounding to 8.3 million lastweek. But some others who track OPEC production estimate muchlower January volumes for Saudi Arabia.   Although the kingdom has the capacity to produce 8.5million barrels a day, the International Energy Agencyestimates this month's production will average only eightmillion barrels a day. That will bring OPEC's total outputdown to 23 million barrels a day for January from 23.5million in December, according to the agency.   Cristina Haus, who monitors OPEC production forWashington-based Energy Security Analysis, estimates SaudiArabia's output will be even lower for January, about 7.6million barrels a day. But Ms. Haus says a study she madeshows a pattern of December-to-January declines in OPECoutput over the past decade, due in part to quotas and ageneral reduction of use by refiners in the first quarter.   The U.S. decision to reduce the amount of oil to be soldfrom the strategic reserve followed an attack on the auctionplan by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu. TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady also lobbied the cabinet vigorouslyagainst tapping the reserve, which contains almost 590million barrels. Pointing to his experience inforeign-exchange trading, Mr. Brady contended that it's hardfor governments to successfully affect the course of largemarkets.   Even before the White House intervention, the EnergyDepartment was considering modifying its sale plans forlargely technical reasons. Although the department wanted tosell twice as much sour, or high-sulfur, crude as sweetcrude, it received far more bids for sweet than for sour.Some of the bids for sour were too low to be accepted under aformula that requires bids to equal at least 90% of theprevailing market price. The department was consideringwhether to change the mix of crude or reduce the amount.   Mr. Moore, the Energy Department official, said thedepartment plans to announce that it will accept bids for14.35 million barrels of sweet, or low-sulfur, crude and 2.95million barrels of sour crude. Originally, the departmentoffered to sell 11.25 million barrels of sweet crude and 22.5million barrels of sour crude. It received bids for 27.9million barrels of sweet crude and 16.9 million barrels ofsour crude.   He said the agency is accepting bids that equal at least97.5% of the prevailing price and predicted that the oilwould be sold for an average price of about $20 a barrel,compared with an average cost of $17.54 a barrel for oilpurchased for the reserve in the past five years.   The biggest bidder was the oil-trading firm Phibro EnergyInc., which sought to buy 23.4 million barrels. Thesecond-biggest bidder, a U.S. unit of London-based BritishPetroleum Co., which sought 3.1 million barrels.   ---   Caleb Solomon in Houston and Michael Siconolfi in New Yorkcontributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
