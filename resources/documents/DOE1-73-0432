The videotape itself presents an introductionto the chemistry involved in a limestone FGD system. Following a descriptionof a typical system, the basic chemical reactions that occur in thisprocess are detailed. The most common operation problems in limestoneFGD---low sulfur dioxide removal, low limestone utilization, and scaling---arereviewed with regard to how process chemistry can be controlled to alleviatethese problems. This tape is an introduction only; future tapes willcover limestone FGD performance indicators and troubleshooting in moredetail.</TEXT></DOC>
