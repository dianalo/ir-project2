The gains in Tokyo were led by chemical, AIDS-related, construction and financial shares.    The Nikkei stock average rose 128.34 points to 22912.99, and the stock exchange index was up 19.85 to 1961.92. Volume rose to two billion shares from 1.8 billion shares Tuesday.    Investors shrugged off Tuesday's plunge on Wall Street because of a continuing flow of liquidity from investment trusts and certain mutual funds, traders said.    Japanese stocks have alternately copied and resisted the results of trading in New York, and some brokers pointed to Wednesday's reversal of Wall Street's trend as a sign of the Tokyo market's growing independence.    In AIDS-related shares, Snow Brand Milk, a diversified dairy products leader, soared 200 yen to 1,380 yen ($9.48) on word that it is making progress on the development of monoclonal antibodies to fight the disease.    Among chemical companies, Sumitomo Chemical, which is also active in AIDS drug research, rose 35 to 865. Shin-Etsu Chemical, also diversified into AIDS research, rose 70 to 1530.    Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry was up 38 to 804 and Nippon Kayaku gained 29 to 969.    Industrial Bank of Japan surged 120 to 3,790. The financial sector was generally higher on the belief that deregulation measures by Japan's government to liberalize the country's financial markets will lead to strong earnings boosts.    Shares of securities firms were up in part because of the recent high stock turnover. Daiwa Securities rose 150 to 3,070 and Yamaichi Securities was up 120 to 2,300.    In the construction group, Kajima advanced 20 to 1,890 on continuing reports of government plans to boost public works spending to energize the domestic economy.    The exception to a sluggish day in Europe was Frankfurt, where prices ended mostly higher, spurred by a late buying spree by foreign and domestic investors.    The buying was centered in the electronics, auto and machinery maker groups. Export-oriented issues were also higher because of the dollar's gains against the mark.    But enthusiasm was damped by fears that a failure of wage negotiations between a powerful metal union and the industry might result in a strike similar to one that paralyzed the nation's auto industry in 1984, brokers said.    One of the big gainers was Nixdorf Computer, which jumped 17 marks to 798 marks ($436.66). The company has reported a 29% profit rise for 1986, and brokers said its earnings potential is strong. Dresdner Bank's announcement late Tuesday that it will leave its dividend at 10 marks a share but distribute one free share for every 18 shares held didn't move the stock price because the news was expected, brokers said. Dresdner inched up 50 pfennigs to 365.5 marks.    In London, prices were lower in quiet trading. The Financial Times 100-share index was off 10.3 at 1976.7, and the 30-share index fell 5.9 to 1558.6. But the gold mines index increased 11.3 to 436.2.    Unlike Tokyo, prices opened lower because of a carryover from Wall Street's big drop Tuesday, brokers said. A firm opening Wednesday in New York helped support a brief midday rally in London, but when Wall Street gave up some of its gains, London shares resumed their slide.    Bowater reported that 1986 pre-tax profit rose to 48 million pounds ($77.7 million) from 32.4 million pounds a year earlier. Profit of about 40 million pounds had been expected, and Bowater rose 45 pence to 513 pence ($8.30).    Paris prices were lower, continuing the previous day's consolidation. The market was weakest early in the session following a rumor that the government may finance the social security system deficit with a special stock market tax.    Brokers said the rumor, combined with Wall Street's decline Tuesday, helped send share prices lower. But buying interest picked up in the afternoon when the government said the tax rumor was false.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                  Apr 7    Apr 6     Year U.S. ........................... 276.9    281.9    + 21.4 Britain ........................ 592.9    593.3    + 19.1 Canada ......................... 427.9    429.8    + 28.4 Japan ......................... 1179.5   1174.3    + 24.8 France ......................... 457.6    464.5    + 12.1 Germany ........................ 232.0    234.2    - 10.7 Hong Kong ..................... 1888.4   1902.1    +  6.2 Switzerland .................... 190.2    191.4    -  5.3 Australia ...................... 323.3    322.3    + 22.5 World index .................... 446.8    448.6    + 25.2</TEXT></DOC>
