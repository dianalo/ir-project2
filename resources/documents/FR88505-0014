L. 96-499)and amended by section 831 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (95Stat. 172, 352, Pub. L. 97-34). This document also contains limited temporaryIncome Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) under the authority of section 367(e)(2)of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by section 631(d)(1) ofthe Tax Reform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2085, 2272, Pub. L. 99-514). Theregulations are issued under the authority contained in section 897 (d),(e), (g), and (j), section 1125(d) of FIRPTA, section 367(e)(2), section1445(e) (5) and (6), and section 7805(a).Section 897(a) of the Internal Revenue Code treats gain or loss derivedby nonresident alien individuals or foreign corporations from the dispositionof U.S. real property interest as if such gain or loss were effectivelyconnected with a U.S. trade or business. Section 897 (d), (e), and (g)provide rules for the application of section 897(a) to certain distributionsand nonrecognition exchanges. Section 897(c) provides, <T3>inter alia, </T3>a rule excepting from treatment as U.S. real propertyinterests certain interests in publicly traded domestic corporations. Thetemporary regulations under section 367(e)(2) relate to the liquidationof certain corporations holding U.S. real property interests. The regulationsunder section 1445(e)(6) require withholding in certain instances on thedisposition of partnership interests and on the distribution of U.S. realproperty interests by partnerships.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Section 897(d) in GeneralSection 897(d)(1) provides, in general, that gain shall be recognized bya foreign corporation on its distribution, including by way of liquidationor redemption, of a United States real property interests, except to theextent otherwise provided in regulations. The gain recognized is the excessof the fair market value of such interest as of the time of the distributionover its adjusted basis.Section 897(d)(2) provides that gain is not recognized under section 897(d)(1)if certain conditions are satisfied. The conditions are that, at the timeof the receipt of the property, the distributee would be subject to incometaxation on a subsequent disposition of the property, and the basis ofthe property is no greater than the adjusted basis of such property beforethe disposition increased by the amount of gain recognized by the distributingcorporation.Distributions by Domestic CorporationsGenerally, the basis of property received by a foreign shareholder froma domestic corporation in a section 301 distribution is determined undersection 301(b). Section 897(f) provides that, in the case of a distributionof a United States real property interest by a domestic corporation toa foreign shareholder, such shareholder's basis shall not exceed the adjustedbasis of the property before the distribution in the hands of the domesticcorporation increased by gain recognized by the domestic corporation onthe distribution that is subject to U.S. taxation and increased by anyU.S. tax paid by or on behalf of the foreign shareholder with respect tothe distribution.If a corporation that is a United States real property holding corporationdistributes property to a foreign shareholder with respect to its stock,the foreign shareholder is treated as having disposed of a United Statesreal property interest. Gain or loss is recognized to the extent that partor all of the distribution is treated under sections 301(c)(3)(A), 302(a),or 331(a) as made in full payment in exchange for stock.If a United States real property holding corporation completely liquidatesunder section 331(a) after the repeal of the <T3>General Utilities </T3>doctrine, and all gain is recognized at theU.S. corporate level under section 336(a), there is no further shareholderlevel tax under section 897(a) with respect to the section 331 exchange.Under the cleansing provision of section 897(c)(1)(B), the shares in theU.S. corporation are not treated as U.S. real property interests.If a corporation (other than certain corporations making an effective electionunder section 897(i)) that is a United States real property holding corporationdistributes property after July 31, 1986, and after the repeal of the <T3>General Utilities </T3>doctrine under sections 332 and 334(b)(1) toan 80 percent foreign corporate shareholder with respect to its stock,the foreign corporate shareholder is not treated as having disposed ofa United States real property interest in a recognition transaction. Theforeign corporate shareholder's basis in the U.S. real property interestwill be the same as in the hands of the domestic corporation. The consequencesof the transaction under section 367(e)(2) are also clarified.Rules are provided for foreign corporations that have elected under section897(i) to be treated as domestic corporations for purposes of section 897.A rule is also provided for section 333 elections.Distributions by Foreign CorporationsA foreign corporation that distributes a United States real property interestmust recognize gain, but not loss, on the distribution except as otherwiseprovided. Gain is not recognized by a foreign corporation if, at the timeof the distribution, the recipient shareholder would be subject to UnitedStates taxation in accordance with the provisions of the regulations ona subsequent disposition of the United States real property interest, andthe recipient shareholder's basis in the United States real property interestis equal to or less than the basis of the property in the corporation'shands increased by the amount of gain recognized by the corporation. Regulationsfor determining the distributee's basis in the distributed property areprovided.The distributing foreign corporation in a liquidation distribution to its80 percent foreign corporate shareholder after July 31, 1986, under sections332(a), 337(a) and 367(e)(2) shall not recognize gain on the U.S. realproperty interests distributed.Regulations are provided for certain section 355 distributions by foreigncorporations and the distribution of domestic corporation stock by a foreigncorporation in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1) (C), (D), or (F).The Service invites comments concerning alternative methods of treatingthe distribution of domestic corporation stock by a foreign corporationin an inbound reorganization such as basis adjustments. An anti-abuse rulethat treats certain stock transfers followed by a liquidation as an inboundreorganization is also provided.A foreign corporation may not use section 337 as in effect prior to theTax Reform Act of 1986 to sell a U.S. real property interest.The regulations also include a provision for the section 897(l) creditin complete liquidations.General Nonrecognition RulesNonrecognition of gain or loss may be obtained with respect to certaindistributions or exchanges under proposed andSection;andSection; 1.897-5T and1.897-6T of United States real property interests if the interests aresubject to United States taxation on subsequent disposition. Certain proceduralrequirements must also be fulfilled. If a recipient waives the otherwiseapplicable benefits of a United States income tax treaty, an interest otherwisequalifying shall be considered to be subject to United States taxationupon its subsequent disposition.Section 897(e) in GeneralSection 897(e)(1) provides that any nonrecognition provision shall applyto a transaction only in the case of an exchange of a United States realproperty interest for an interest the sale of which would be subject toUnited States taxation.Section 897(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary to issue necessary or appropriateregulations to prevent the avoidance of Federal income taxes. These regulationsprovide the extent to which nonrecognition provisions shall apply undersection 897, and the extent to which transfers of property in reorganizationsshall be treated as sales of property at fair market value.Nonrecognition ExchangesThe regulation provides that a nonrecognition provision shall apply toa transfer of a United States real property interest by a foreign persononly to the extent that a United States real property interest is exchangedfor a United States real property interest which immediately followingthe exchange would be subject to United States taxation upon its disposition.An interest is subject to United States taxation upon its disposition inaccordance with the general nonrecognition rules described above. A nonrecognitionprovision is any provision of the Code which provides that gain or lossshall not be recognized if the requirements of that provision are met.If the nonrecognition provision does not apply, then the interest transferredis subject to taxation under section 897.If a nonrecognition provision applies to the transfer of a United Statesreal property interest, then the basis of the property received by thetransferor is determined under the generally applicable rules. The basisof the exchanged property received by the transferee is determined underthe generally applicable rules. If the transferor recognizes gain on theexchange of a United States real property interest, then the transferee'sbasis in the property will be increased if the generally applicable rulesso provide.A transferor that receives nonqualifying property, such as a foreign realproperty interest, in addition to United States real property interestssubject to United States tax on disposition must recognize gain or lossequal to the lesser of either (1) the sum of the cash received plus thefair market value of the nonqualifying property received, or (2) the gainor loss realized with respect to the United States real property interesttransferred. Specific rules are provided for mixed exchanges where botha United States real property interest and other property (including cash)is transferred in exchange both for qualifying and nonqualifying property.Rules are also provided for certain foreign to foreign transfers in section361 transactions, and contributions to capital under section 897(j).Anti-Abuse ProvisionsRules denying nonrecognition with respect to certain tax avoidance transfersare provided. These include certain transfers by foreign persons to domesticcorporations, basis adjustment for certain related person transactions,and the rearrangement of ownership to gain a treaty benefit.Partnership Interests_Section 897(g) and Section 1445(e)An interest in a partnership in which fifty percent or more in value ofthe gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests and ninety percentor more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real propertyinterests and cash or cash equivalents is considered entirely a U.S. realproperty interest for purposes of withholding on dispositions of such interests.Section 1034 Rollovers_Sections 897(e) and 1445A rule is provided under section 897(e) that permits a nonresident alienindividual to utilize section 1034 on the sale of a principal residencethat is a U.S. real property interest when another U.S. real property interestis purchased and used as a principal residence within a two year periodbefore or after the sale. Gain recognition is required if the principalresidence purchased is not a U.S. real property interest. Special withholdingrules under section 1445 are also provided with respect to the sale ofa principal residence for more than $300,000.Section 897(i) Elections_U.S. real property holding corporation statusrequiredA rule is provided under section 897(i) that requires that a foreign corporationmaking an election under that provision must be a U.S. real property holdingcorporation.Section 897(a)_Definition of foreign personThe definition of foreign person in the regulations under section 897(a)is clarified to explain under which circumstances a foreign governmentis taxable under (or subject to) sections 897, 1445, and 6039C.Section 897(c)(3) in generalSection 897(c)(3) excepts certain interests in a U.S. real property holdingcorporation from treatment as a U.S. real property interest. Dispositionsby foreign persons of interests in a U.S. corporation which are not treatedas U.S. real property interests are not subject to tax under section 897.Beneficial ownership of an interest of five percent or less of any classof stock of a domestic corporation which is regularly traded on an establishedsecurities market is not treated as a U.S. real property interest. In addition,the current regulations provide that any other interest in a domestic U.S.real property holding corporation is not treated as a U.S. real propertyinterest if the fair market value of the interest is five percent or lessof the fair market value of the regularly traded class of stock of theU.S. real property holding corporation with the lowest fair market value.The regulations under section 897(c)(3) are being modified in the followingrespects.Interests Traded on Foreign Securities Markets Interests in a domestic corporation traded on foreign securities marketsmust be registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the``1934 Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78, to be treated as ``regularly traded'' interestsfor purposes of section 897(c)(3). This rule is modified to provide analternative reporting requirement for corporations not otherwise requiredto register under the 1934 Act. In lieu of registration with the SEC, suchcorporations may file with the Service a report disclosing the beneficialowners of interests greater than 5 percent of any class of interests inthe corporation which are traded on foreign securities markets, and suchother identifying information as the Service requires. In addition, a classof interest traded on foreign securities markets must satisfy certain volumerequirements to be treated as regularly traded within the meaning of section897(c)(3). Non-Regularly Traded Interests in Publicly Traded Corporations Beneficial ownership of an interest in a domestic U.S. real property holdingcorporation which is not itself regularly traded is treated as a U.S. realproperty interest only if the fair market value of the interest on thedate it was acquired is greater than five percent of the fair market valueof the regularly traded class of interests of the U.S. real property holdingcorporation having the lowest fair market value. This rule is modifiedto provide that beneficial ownership of an interest in a class of non-regularlytraded convertible interests in a domestic U.S. real property holding corporationwill be treated as a U.S. real property interest only if the interest isgreater than 5 percent of the fair market value of the class of stock intowhich the interest is convertible. Need for Temporary Regulations These regulations, if adopted, would generally apply to all transactionsoccurring after June 18, 1980. However, andSection;1.897-5T(b)(2)(iv) appliesonly to certain transactions occurring after July 31, 1986; andSection;andSection;1.897-7T,1.897-8T, and 1.1445-10T apply only to certain transactions occurrring30 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>and andSection;1.1445-9T applies only to certaintransfers occurring 90 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The temporary regulations will clarify unsettled law in this area, andprovide taxpayers with needed immediate guidance. Many taxpayers have notbeen able to effectuate transactions, such as corporate reorganizations,because of the lack of regulatory guidance. This effective date is alsonecessary to prevent avoidance of tax. The effective date for andSection;1.897-5(b)(2)(iv) corresponds with theeffective date of the repeal of the <T3>General Utilities </T3>doctrine. The concepts underlying the repealof the <T3>General Utilities </T3>doctrine are incorporated in the proposed regulations.The effective date of paragraph (e) of andSection;1.897-9T corresponds withthe effective date of the amendment of section 892 by the Tax Reform Actof 1986. The extraordinary, retroactive regulatory relief from the rules of section897 (d) and (e) has been provided because these regulations are consideredto be issued under unusual circumstances. For all of these reasons, this regulation is not issued subject to thepublic notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. section 553 (b) or to the effectivedate limitation of paragraph (d) of that section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>It has been determined that these temporary regulations are not a majorrule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that a Regulatory Impact Analysisis therefore not required. It has also been determined that these regulationswill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.Few small entities would be affected by these regulations. A regulatoryflexibility analysis, therefore, is not required under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The collection of information contained in theseregulations has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget inaccordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.These requirements have been approved by OMB. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of this regulation is Charles P. Besecky of the Officeof Associate Chief Counsel (International), within the Office of ChiefCounsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other officesof the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated indeveloping the regulations on matters of substance and style. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>26 CFR 1.861-1 to 1.997-1 Income taxes, Aliens, Exports, DISC, Foreign Investment in U.S., Foreigntax credit, FSC, Sources of income, United States investments abroad. 26 CFR 1.1441-1 to 1.1465-1 Income taxes, Aliens, Foreign corporations. 26 CFR Part 602 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

A foreign corporation that meets the stock ownershiprequirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in a domestic corporationthat is a U.S. real property interest shall not, after December 31, 1984,be subject to taxation by reason of section 367(a). The foreign corporationshall recognize gain pursuant to section 897(e)(1) on such stock upon thereceipt of property in a section 332(a) liquidation from such domesticcorporation, but only to the extent that the property received constitutesproperty other than a U.S. real property interest. The gain on the stockin the domestic corporation to be recognized by the foreign corporationpursuant to section 897(e)(1) shall be determined by multiplying the gainrealized on the distribution by a fraction. The numerator of the fractionshall be the fair market value of the property other than U.S. real propertyinterests received by the foreign corporation on the distribution, andthe denominator shall be the fair market value of all property receivedby the foreign corporation on the distribution. The bases of the distributedU.S. real property interests in the hands of the foreign corporation shallbe the same as the bases in the hands of the domestic corporation. Thebases of the property other than U.S. real property interests in the handsof the foreign corporation shall be the same as the bases in the handsof the domestic corporation, plus any gain recognized by the foreign corporationon the distribution allocated among such assets in proportion to the potentialgain inherent in each such asset at the time of distribution.

A foreign corporationthat meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respectto stock in a domestic corporation that is a U.S. real property interestrecognize gain on the reciept of property in a section 332(a) liquidationwhere section 334(b)(2) applies to the extent that the fair market valueof the distributed assets that are not U.S real property interests exceedsthe basis of such assets determined under section 334(b)(2) (for example,if the liquidation does not occur immediately upon the purchase of stockin the domestic corporation). The gain recognized shall not exceed theexcess of the fair market value of the stock of the domestic corporationin the hands of foreign at the time of the distribution over the shareholder'sadjusted basis in such stock. The basis of the distributed U.S. real propertyinterests in the hands of the foreign corporation shall be determined undersection 334(b)(2), by reference to the adjusted basis of the stock withrespect to which the distribution was made. The basis of such propertyother than U.S. real property interests shall be tentatively determinedunder section 334(b)(2), and then increased by any gain recognized by theforeign corporation on the distribution allocated among such assets inproportion to the potential gain inherent in each such asset at the timeof distribution (computed using the tentative basis as determined undersection 334(b)(2)).

The domestic corporationshall not recognize gain under section 367(e)(2) on the distribution ofU.S. real property interests (other than stock in a former U.S. real propertyholding corporation which is treated as a U.S. real property interest)to the foreign corporation. The domestic corporation shall recognize gainunder section 367(e)(2) on the distribution of stock in a former U.S. realproperty holding corporation which is treated as a U.S. real property interest.With respect to recognition of gain or loss by the domestic corporationunder section 367(e)(2) on the distribution of property other than U.S.real property interests, see the regulations under section 367(e)(2). Thebasis of the distributed U.S. real property interests (other than stockin a former U.S. real property holding corporation) in the hands of theforeign corporation shall be the same as it was in the hands of the domesticcorporation. The basis of any property (other than U.S. real property interests)and stock in a former U.S. real property holding corporation that is aU.S. real property interest in the hands of the foreign corporation shallbe the same as it was in the hands of the domestic corporation increasedby any gain recognized by the distributing corporation on the distributionthat was subject to U.S. taxation.

The numerator of the fractionshall be the fair market value of the property received by the distributeeforeign corporation upon which it must recognize gain, and the denominatorof the fraction shall be the fair market value of all property receivedby the distributee foreign corporation on the distribution. The distributingforeign corporation shall not recognize gain under section 367(e)(2) onthe distribution of U.S. real property interests to the distributee foreigncorporation. With respect to the recognition of gain or loss under section367(e)(2) on the distribution of property other than U.S. real propertyinterests, see the regulations under section 367(e)(2). The basis of thedistributed U.S. real property interests in the hands of the distributeeforeign corporation shall be the same as it was in the hands of the distributingforeign corporation.

This results in a potential gain of 400x. Under section358, C takes a 360x adjusted basis in the DC stock. Provided that FC complieswith the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section,the gain recognized by FC is limited under paragraph (c)(3)(i) to 160xbecause (A) this is the amount by which the basis of the DC stock in thehands of C (360x) exceeds the adjusted basis of the DC stock in the handsof FC (200x), and (B) at the time of receipt of the DC stock, C would besubject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) C's adjusted basis in the DC stock is not increased by the 160xrecognized by FC.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Distribution by a foreign corporation in certain reorganizations</T3>_(i)<T3>In general. </T3>Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a foreigncorporation that transfers property to another corporation in an exchangeunder section 361(a) for stock of a domestic corporation which is a UnitedStates real property holding corporation immediately after the transferin a reorganization under section 368(a)(1) (C), (D), or (F) shall recognizegain under section 897(d)(1) on the distribution (whether actual or deemed)of the stock of the domestic corporation received by the foreign corporationto its shareholders (whether domestic or foreign).

In 1986,FC's only asset is Parcel P, a U.S. real property interest with a fairmarket value of $600,000 and an adjusted basis to FC of $200,000. ParcelP is subject to a mortgage with an outstanding balance of $100,000. Thefair market value of the FC stock is $500,000, and A's adjusted basis inthe stock is $100,000. FC does not have liabilities in excess of the adjustedbasis in Parcel P. The United States does not have a treaty with CountryW that entitles FC to nondiscriminatory treatment as described in section1.897-3(b)(2) of the regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Pursuant to a plan of reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D),FC transfers Parcel P to DC, a newly formed domestic corporation, in exchangefor DC stock. FC distributes the DC stock to A in exchange for A's FC stock.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) FC's exchange of Parcel P for the DC stock is a dispositionof a U.S. real property interest. Under andSection; 1.897-6T(a)(1), thereis an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (Parcel P) for anotherU.S. real property interest (DC stock) so that no gain is recognized onthe exchange under section 897(e). DC takes FC's basis of $200,000 in ParcelP under section 362(b). Under section 358(a)(1), FC takes a $100,000 basisin the DC stock because FC's substituted basis of $200,000 in the DC stockis reduced by the $100,000 of liabilities to which Parcel P is subject.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Under section 897(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section,FC generally must recognize gain on the distribution of the DC stock receivedin exchange for FC's assets equal to the difference between the fair marketvalue of the DC stock ($500,000) and FC's adjusted basis in the DC stockprior to the distribution ($100,000). This results in a potential gainof $400,000. Under section 358(a)(1), A takes a basis in the DC stock equalto its basis in the FC stock of $100,000. Provided that FC complies withthe filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, no gainis recognized by FC on the distribution of the DC stock under the statutoryexception to the general rule of section 897(d)(1) provided in section897(d)(2)(A) and paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section because (<T3>1</T3>) A's basis in the DC stock ($100,000) does not exceed FC's adjustedbasis in the DC stock ($100,000) immediately prior to the distributionand (<T3>2</T3>) A, at the time of receipt of the DC stock, would be subjectto U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) The FC stock in the hands of A is not a U.S. real property interestbecause FC is a foreign corporation that has not elected to be treatedas a domestic corporation under section 897(i).

However, provided that FC complies with the filingrequirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the gain recognizedby FC is limited to $200,000 under the regulatory limitation of gain providedby paragraph (c)(4)(iii). This is the excess of A's basis in the FC stockimmediately before the distribution ($300,000) over A's adjusted basisin the DC stock immediately before the distribution ($100,000).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) A takes a basis of $300,000 in the DC stock under section 358(a)(1).A's basis in the DC stock is not increased by the gain recognized by FC.DC takes a basis of $200,000 in Parcel P under section 362(b). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4).</T3> (i) The facts are the same as in <T3>Example</T3> (3), except that the United States has an income tax treatywith Country W entitling FC to nondiscriminatory treatment under section1.897-3(b)(2) of the regulations.

Gain is considered subject to U.S. taxation if the gainis included on the income tax return of a U.S. tax paying entity even ifthere is no U.S. tax liability (for example, because of net operating lossesor an investment tax credit). Gain is not considered subject to U.S. taxationif the gain is derived by a tax exempt entity. A real estate investmenttrust is considered to be a pass-through entity for purposes of the ruleof taxability of this paragraph (d)(1)(i). Thus, for example, a tax exemptentity holding an interest in a real estate investment trust is not subjectto tax. A domestic corporation (including a foreign corporation that makesan effective section 897(i) election after receipt of the U.S. real propertyinterest) shall not be considered subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequentdisposition of a U.S. real property interest if it received the U.S. realproperty interest prior to the effective date of the repeal of section336(a) or 337(a) as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, unlessthe U.S. real property interest has not been sold or exchanged by the domesticcorporation prior to such effective date in a transaction to which eithersection 336(a) or section 337(a) (as in effect prior to such effectivedate) applied.

The portion of the interest that is treated as subject to U.S.taxation is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the interestby a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of tax thatwould be due pursuant to the provisions of the applicable U.S. income taxtreaty upon the recipient's disposition of the interest, determined asof the date of the distribution or transfer. The denominator of the fractionis the amount of tax that would be due upon such disposition but for theprovisions of the treaty.

Country F does not have an income tax treaty with the United States.A is the sole proprietor of a business located in the United States, theassets of which consist of a U.S. real property interest with a fair marketvalue of $1,000,000 and an adjusted basis of $700,000, and equipment usedin the business with a fair market value of $500,000 and an adjusted basisof $250,000. A decides to incorporate the business, and on January 1, 1987,A transfers his assets to domestic corporation DC in exchange for 100 percentof the stock of DC, with a fair market value of $900,000. In addition,A receives a long term note (constituting a security) from DC for $600,000,bearing arm's length interest and repayment terms. DC has no assets otherthan those received in the exchange with A. Pursuant to section 897(c)(2)and andSection; 1.897-2, DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation.Therefore, the stock of DC is a U.S. real property interest. Assume thatthe note from DC constitutes an interest in the corporation solely as acreditor as provided by andSection; 1.897-1(d)(4) of the regulation. A complieswith the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of andSection; 1.897-5T.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Because the note from DC would not be subject to U.S. taxationupon its disposition, it is nonqualifing property for purposes of determiningwhether A is entitled to receive nonrecognition treatment pursuant to section351 with respect to his exchange of the U.S. real property interest. Thus,A must recognize gain in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) ofthis section. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A), the amount of nonqualifyingproperty received in exchange for the real property interests is determinedby multiplying the fair market value of such property ($600,000) by thereal property fraction. The numerator of the fraction is $1,000,000, thefair market value of the real property transferred by A. The demoninatoris $1,500,000, the fair market value of all property transferred by A.Thus, A is considered to have received $400,000 of the note in exchangefor the real property ($600,000 X $1,000,000/$1,500,000). Pursuant to paragraph(a)(8)(ii)(B), A must recognize the lesser of the amount initially determinedor the gain realized with respect to the U.S. real property interest. Therefore,A must recognize the $300,000 gain realized with respect to the real property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(C) of this section, A is consideredto have received $200,000 of the note in exchange for equipment ($600,000[total value of note received] minus $400,000 [portion of note receivedin exchange for real property]), $600,000 of the stock in exchange forreal property ($900,000 [total value of stock received] times $1,000,000/1,500,000)[proportion of property exchanged consisting of real property]), and $300,000of the stock in exchange for equipment ($900,000 [total value of stockreceived] minus $600,000 [portion of stock received in exchange for realproperty]). All three amounts are entitled to nonrecognition treatmentpursuant to section 351. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, A's basis in thestock and note received and DC's basis in the U.S. real property interestand equipment will be determined in accordance with the generally applicablerules. The $400,000 portion of the note received in exchange for the realproperty interest is other property. Pursuant to section 358(a)(2), A takesa fair market value ($400,000) basis for that portion of the note. Pursuantto section 358(a)(1), A's basis in the property received without the recognitionof gain (the DC stock and the other portion of the note) will be equalto the basis of the property transferred ($950,000 [$700,000 basis of U.S.real property interest plus $250,000 basis of equipment]), decreased bythe fair market value of the other property received ($400,000 portionof the note), and increased by the amount of gain recognized to A on thetransaction ($300,000). Thus, A's basis in the stock and the nonrecognitionportion of the note is $850,000 ($950,000-$400,000+$300,000). Under andSection;1.358-2(b)(2)of the regulations, the $850,000 is allocated between the stock and thenonrecognition portion of the note in proportion to their fair market values.A takes a basis of $697,000 in the DC stock ($850,000andmultiply;900,000/1,100,000).A takes a basis of $153,000 in the nonrecognition portion of the note ($850,000andmultiply;200,000/1,100,000).A's basis in the note is $553,000 ($400,000+$153,000). DC's basis in theproperty received from A will be determined under section 362(a). DC takesa basis of $1,000,000 in the real property interest (A's basis of $700,000increased by the $300,000 of gain recognized by A on it).
