The acquisition of Apollo last year,which vaulted HP to the top of the technical workstation market? The&quot;Spectrum&quot; RISC architecture? The HP9000 Unix platforms? The ubiquitousLaserJet printer? Excellent service and support?andM;You may have come up with any or all of the above.andP;  But would &quot;an innovative,open, multiplatform, object-oriented office system&quot; have occurred to you?andO;Probably not, unless, of course, you've been following UP's progress with itsNewWave environment for DOS.andM;Well, take notice.andP;  HP is building a dynamite office contender with itsNewWave Office.andP;  HP is certainly not the only major computer vendor to committo Unix as a primary office server platform, but it is the first to actuallyintroduce a real product with a real delivery date (next month).andP;  And theNewWave environment on workstations is seductive enough to win you over witha simple live demo.andP;  HP is also doing some interesting things withthird-party partnerships, and hopes to make its object management model anindustry standard through the Object Management Group (OMG).andM;While all is not in the bag-HP's Unix client software will not be availableuntil sometime next year, the distributed version of NewWave is still underdevelopment, and not all system services are yet implemented-we think HP'sNewWave Office for Unix merits a close look.andM;The StrategyandM;COOPERATIVE COMPUTING.andP;  HP recognized early the need to migrate to adistributed computing environment.andP;  In 1985, HP decided to begin the movefrom host-based processing to a client/server model.andM;HP has had &quot;cooperative computing&quot; products on the market for over fouryears.andP;  Having successfully survived the pain associated with such atransition, HP is now moving all of its products in this direction.andP;  Justlast month, the company formally unveiled its Cooperative ComputingEnvironment Architecture and strategy-NewWave Computing.andP;  NewWave Computingis a distributed network computing architecture that allows users to selectthe appropriate operating system for both the client and server with accessto object-oriented services across the network.andP;  The ultimate goal istransparent interoperability across networks of heterogeneous systems.andM;NewWave Office, HP's new office offering, is a cornerstone of NewWaveComputing and the foundation for HP's office-systems strategy for the 1990s.andO;HP's strategy is to provide an open and consistent &quot;enabling environment&quot;based on the following:andM;Commitment to industry standards.andM;User-oriented desktop metaphor, focusing on the task the user wants toperform rather than on the specific applications required to do the task.andO;NewWave also masks complexity for the user-complexity of the operatingsystem, file system, application integration, and applications development.andO;Choice of server and client platforms.andP;  Modular integration of applications.andO;The NewWave Object Management Facility (ONF) is key here.andP;  NewWave providesseveral levels of integration, including encapsulation for limitedintegration of existing applications without modification, and the OMF APIsfor creating fully functionalandM;NewWave applications.andM;OFFICE COMPUTING.andP;  Prior to announcing NewWave in late 1987, HP had followedthe same general path in developing office systems as everyone else did inthe minicomputer industry.andP;  Original products were time shared and terminalbased, with the host performing all of the work.andP;  As the PC began to dominatethe desktop in the mid '80s, at least some portion of the office processingwas moved to the DOS platform, most notably the user interface, local mailfunctions, and word processing.andM;With NewWave, HP began a different approach to office.andP;  The design centermoved to the desktop as HP put together its object management model andintroduced the standalone NewWave environment for DOS.andP;  NewWave Office,announced last November, extends this environment to workgroups.andP;  NewWaveOffice also incorporates new server and client platforms, a key component ofHP's strategy.andP;  Unix and OS/2 will be added to MPE/XL (HP's proprietaryoperating system) as servers and to DOS on the client side.andP;  (SeeIllustration 1.)andM;ROLE OF UNIX.andP;  There is no question about the strategic role Unix plays forHP.andP;  The company's Unix operating system, HPUX, is based on and fullycomplies with ATandamp;T's Unix System V, and HP intends to merge HP-UX with OSF/1and OSF/2 in the future.andP;  HP has developed a strong underlying hardwareplatform for HP-UX with its extensive family of HP9000 servers andworkstations, including symmetric multiprocessing capabilities.andP;  The HP9000series is based on the Precision Architecture RISC (PA-RISC) chip sets andMotorola 68xxx.andP;  (See News and Analysis, Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  2, for an analysis ofthe PA-RISC server announcements HP made this past January, and of thecompany's agreement with Sequoia Systems.)andM;In the workstation arena, HP has clarified its strategy with regard to Apolloand will combine the HP RISC architecture with that of Apollo within the nextyear.andP;  The Apollo acquisition also gives HP NCS (Network Computing System)leadership and access to other distributed network computing technology.andP;  HPis now integrating Apollo's talented Randamp;D professionals into its own Randamp;Dplanning process.andP;  Commercial Unix.andP;  While it has a strong presence in thetechnical Unix market, HP is focusing heavily on commercial Unix in itsmarketing efforts.andP;  IBM, on the other hand, is leading with the technicalmarket and Digital Equipment is having a difficult time bringing itsRISC/Ultrix platform into parity, in both functionality and marketing focus,with its proprietary, more robust VAX/VMS platform.andM;Beyond building an enabling platform for commercial Unix applications, HP isalso delivering key applications of its own, including NewWave Office, anetwork management station, integrated voice/data, and MRP II (HP's OpenMfg).andM;Another perspective here is that HP demonstrates a sophisticatedunderstanding of the commercial Unix market.andP;  Important elements of HP's Unixsolution include the OpenSpool/UX commercial spooler for data centermanagement, OLTP tuning for transaction performance, resource-sharing withLAN Manager/X, plans to implement B1 level security at the operating systemlevel, and features to enhance reliability and data integrity (e.g.,andO;disk-mirroring and auto restart).andP;  Positioning MPE/XL and Unix.andP;  HP is alsomuch clearer than either of its larger competitors in positioning itsproprietary MPE/XL operating environment (which runs on the HP3000 series)vis-a-vis Unix.andP;  HP-UX is positioned as the standards-based, open-systemsalternative for commercial applications, with MPE/XL offering optimizedtransaction processing capabilities.andM;HP is committed to interoperability and coexistence between MPE/XL and HP.andO;One advantage here is that both run on the same underlying PA-RISCarchitecture.andP;  HP is also way ahead of the competition at the applicationslevel.andP;  For example, the entire family of Allbase, (SQL relational databaseproducts runs on both MPE and HP-UX.andP;  The interfaces and tools are the sameon each platform.andP;  The next release of Allbase/Net will allow connectivitybetween MPE and Unix Allbase databases.andP;  Interoperability is particularlyimportant to customers who want to migrate from a proprietary to an opensystem.andP;  Office.andP;  Thus, it is no surprise that Unix plays a significant rolein HP's office strategy.andP;  HP's NewWave Office servers for MPE/XL and Unixwill be available concurrently, and will interoperate at the service levelfor both mail and database access.andP;  They are also equivalent infunctionality, with the same services and application utilities.andP;  The onlyexception is PC hard disk backup, available only on MTE.andM;HP is acutely aware of the opportunities here, and the fact that itstraditional office competitors, IBM and Digital, are sorely behind in theUnix arena.andP;  Nowhere to be seen, in fact.andP;  They are only talking in generalterms about what they intend to do in the future; the only products they canmarket today are third-party offerings from Uniplex, Applix, and Quadratron.andO;(While DECwrite and DECwindows are both available on Digital's Ultrixplatform, there is no equivalent to All-In-1 functionality.) We fully expectIBM and Digital to get their respective acts together and begin to moveforward in the Unix office arena, but HP could have a sizeable headstart bythen.andP;  We may not see OfficeVision on AIX for a couple of years.andP;  Digital isstill busy cleaving All-In-1 into a client/server mode on VMS, and does notyet have a database on Unix.andM;Office software competitors such as Uniplex, Applix, and Quadratron have theadvantage of running on diverse Unix platforms.andP;  HP's approach here is tocreate alliances with these vendors and interoperate with their products.andM;In the Unix environment in particular, HP sees the potential for NewWave andNewWave Office to exist on a broad range of vendor platforms.andP;  OpenMail, theNewWave Office transport in Unix, is architected for portability, and HP isworking with third parties willing to port it to other operating platforms(see box, &quot;Uniplex Extends OpenMail's Horizons,&quot; on page 14).andM;ROLE OF THIRD PARTIES.andP;  It is vitally important for HP's long-term success toattract a critical mass of software developers to the NewWave platform.andP;  Thewell-publicized American Airlines move to NewWave has had a big impact inthis area.andP;  HP is working with both independent software vendors (ISVs) andvalue-added resellers (VARs) to incorporate NewWave Office into theirapplication products.andP;  As we went to press, about 100 ISVs had committed toNewWave.andM;The focus for ISVs is to make their software products NewWave compliant.andP;  Oneof the obstacles for ISVs in DOS is the requirement to write to MS Windows.andO;Some of the largest and most coveted ISVs (e.g., Lotus, Ashton-Tate,WordPerfect) have not yet committed to implementing Windows versions of theirpopular applications.andP;  However, Lotus recently announced that it will takeover responsibility for the existing NewWave browser for Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  Thiswas developed by HP (and comes with NewWave) to allow Lotus spreadsheets toplay an integrated role in NewWave without requiting Lotus to write toNewWave.andP;  While this is not a full commitment to NewWave, Lotus will enhancethe browser to support Release 2.2 (e.g., memory enhancements and support forcolor).andM;VARs are encouraged to incorporate pieces of NewWave Office, such asInformation Access, into their vertical applications written for the miniserver.andP;  VARs can also convert their applications to the cooperativeprocessing model, separating the client and server components.andP;  OEMS.andP;  HP isactively pursuing OEMs for NewWave, offering NewWave, the OMF, and networkobject-sharing for licensing by other computer vendors.andP;  This is part of HP'sapproach to make NewWave a de facto industry standard.andP;  Data General haslicensed NewWave as the front end for its CEO Object Office product.andP;  ATandamp;Tand NCR have licensed NewWave for the DOS clients in their new client-serverenvironments.andP;  Canon has also licensed NewWave and is developing a Japaneseversion on all three client platforms-DOS, Unix, and OS/2-for HP.andM;NewWave OfficeandM;The first implementation of HP's NewWave Office framework consists of -  *NewWave environment (a single-user license is included)andM;* Networked object-sharingandM;* Information distribution  mail system)andM;* Information access (access to databases across the network)andM;* Shared resourcesandM;* Networked PC managementandM;The NewWave environment currently provides the graphical NewWave desktop,NewWave Write (a compound document processor), a Lotus browser (for viewingLotus spreadsheets within NewWave objects), a Help function, computerbasedtraining (CBT), and the encapsulation software.andP;  Agents are not yetimplemented but will be included in a later release.andM;NewWave Office extends the scope of NewWave beyond the individual desktop tothe workgroup, providing access to network servers, services, and data (seeIllustration 2).andP;  We will first give some background on the NewWave Officeplatforms.andP;  Then we will describe what the standalone NewWave environmentoffers, followed a description of the Newve Office extensions.andP;  RVERS.andP;  HPhas committed to three NewWave Office server platforms:andM;* NewWave Office for MPE, available in May.andM;* NewWave Office for Unix, on an series 600 and 800 running HP-UX Version 7.0or later.andP;  This will also be available in May.andM;* NewWave Office for OS/2 on a 286/386 PC running the OS/2 operating system.andO;HP has not announced a date for availability of the OS/2 version of NewWaveOffice, and has not yet committed to putting the networked PC managementfunctions on OS/2.andM;CLIENTS.andP;  On DOS, NewWave uses Microsoft Windows to provide capabilities thatthe operating system lacks (e.g., a messaging system and context-switching).andO;The NewWave developer on the DOS platform must write to both Windows and theNewWave APIs to get a fully compliant NewWave application.andP;  On the Unix andOS/2 platforms, however, these capabilities are part of the operating system,and the developer will not be required to write to a particular windowingmanager.andP;  DOS.andP;  The NewWave DOS client software runs under Microsoft Windows,the de facto standard for window management on DOS.andP;  The only version ofWindows that NewWave accepts currently is Windows/286 Version 2.11.andP;  HP chosenot to implement NewWave under Windows/386 but to wait for future versions ofWindows.andP;  Version 3.0 is currently under development and due out this summer.andM;The recommended configuration for NewWave is a 386 or a fast 286 (minimum 12MHz for performance reasons) with 4MB memory, a 1.2MB 5.25-inch or 720K3.5-inch disk drive, 20MB of hard disk storage, and a MicrosoftWindows-supported mouse.andP;  Required software is DOS 3.2 or higher andWindows/286 2.11.andM;If you don't want to use the NewWave graphical interface, the NewWave OfficeDOS client also comes with Personal Applications manager, a character-based,menu-driven DOS interface.andP;  Unix.andP;  The NewWave client for HP's Unix platformwill use Motif as the windowing manager.andP;  (Motif is the Open SoftwareFoundation's user interface spec based on a Presentation Manager look with XWindow APIs underneath.) HP VUE, HP's implementation of Motif, will ship thissummer, the company is building NewWave for Unix on top of this.andP;  HP maydecide to bundle HP VUE with the NewWave software.andP;  (With Windows 3.0,Windows, Motif, and Presentation Manager will look almost identical to theuser.)andM;The Unix client is not available yet, and HP has disclosed no dates for this.andO;However, the NewWave Developers' Kit for Unix will ship by the end of thisyear.andP;  The end-user client software will probably appear six to nine monthslater.andM;Until the Unix client software is released, Unix workstations will be limitedto terminal emulation access to NewWave Office services such as mail andshared resources.andP;  OS/2.andP;  The OS/2 client is also not available yet, but HPstates that the NewWave Developers' Kit for OS/2 Presentation Manager willship at about the same time as the one for Unix.andM;HP is still deciding which client to release first-Unix or OS/2-and iscurrently working hard on the development of both.andP;  This has become an evenmore difficult issue with the advent of Unix/386.andP;  The company is monitoringclosely the demand for OS/2 vs.andP;  Unix/ 386 vs.andP;  HP's RISC/Unix platform.andP;  Thecompany views OS/2 as the successful follow-on to DOS, and a particularlygood platform for HP since it has focused so heavily on integrating the DOSplatform into its office strategy.andP;  While Unix is probably more important toHP commercially in the short term, the company views OS/2 as very importantin the long term.andP;  Macintosh.andP;  Since the Macintosh already has a graphicaluser interface, customers with Macs are not exactly beating down the door toget NewWave on this platform.andP;  They are much more interested in access tonetwork services, which is the focus of HP's efforts.andP;  The priorities are toprovide terminal emulation over a LAN, access to print- and file-sharing,client mail access, and client database access.andM;The NewWave EnvironmentandM;THE NEWWAVE DESKTOP.andP;  The NewWave desktop, or office window, displays twotypes of icons: tools and objects.andP;  Tools are applications that perform sometask for you, e.g., the Printers icon is a tool for printing an object.andP;  Youactivate a tool by dropping an object on it, or, in some cases, bydouble-clicking on it (e.g., a clock).andP;  Objects are applications that createand manage datafiles.andP;  A NewWave object, in fact, represents both the dataand the application that created it.andP;  You open an object by double-clickingon it with the mouse.andP;  This opens the datafile and launches the applicationthat created it.andP;  Currently, the icons are not in color; with the Windows 3.0release of NewWave, NewWave will implement a customizable color scheme forthe icons.andM;Tools.andP;  Tools, represented as three-dimensional icons, include theWastebasket, Printers, File Drawer, Information Access (optional software),the Agent (which sports shades and looks like Clark Kent-unassuming butpowerful), MS-DOS Commander, Dictionaries, Slide Show, Executive Insight(optional), and Clipboard.andP;  The user can also add tools throughencapsulation.andP;  Obvious examples here would be MS Windows applications suchas the Calculator and Clock.andP;  Other interesting tools might be a fax machineor a telephone dialer.andP;  NewWave has a &quot;manage tools&quot; option, allowing you tochoose which ones you see displayed on the desktop.andP;  Objects.andP;  Objects arerepresented by two-dimensional icons.andP;  During installation, NewWave createsthe master NewWave objects, such as Folder, Agent Task, Drawing Object andChart Object (both part of HP's Gallery Collection software), NewWave Write,NewWave Image (an application for displaying an image scanned with HP'sScanJet) and Bridge Builder.andP;  The user can also instruct NewWave toencapsulate over 20 DOS applications for which UP has already createdbridges.andP;  NewWave then adds these as master objects as wen.andP;  CreatingObjects.andP;  To create a new object, you first get a display of the icons thatrepresent the current object types, called masters or master objects, thatthe user can create.andP;  You select the type of object you want to create andgive it a tide.andP;  A new icon is then added to your desktop; the icon looks thesame as that for the master object, and the tide you entered is displayedunder the icon.andP;  You then just double-click on the new object icon to openit.andP;  This activates the application and allows you to add data to the object.andM;When creating a new object using an encapsulated DOS application, NewWaverestricts you to a title that conforms to DOS file-naming conventions.andO;NewWave precedes the title with  DOS:&quot; to show that the object was createdwith an encapsulated application.andM;It is very easy to reorder the list of master objects, e.g., to put foldersfirst if you work with them a lot.andP;  We would also like the option to see moreof the icons at once on the screen when we create a new objectandM;You can create templates arid add these as options when creating newobjeces-for example, a standard letter created with WordPerfect or a budgetframework in Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  (See Illustration 4.) Manipulating Objects.andP;  HPhas been consistent with Windows conventions in die manipulation of objects.andO;All of die mouse movements in NewWave for copying and moving objects are thesame as in Windows.andM;NewWave also provides the ability to share one object into another object orinto other multiple objects.andP;  This creates a live link between the originalobject and the shared version of the object.andP;  When you change one display ofthe linked object, all of the linked versions change.andP;  A shared object can bethought of as multiple displays of the same object.andM;The file cabinet and folders represent local files on die desktop.andP;  Folderscan be nested to an unlimited level.andP;  Objects are filed in a folder bydragging them to the folder icon.andP;  An object can be removed from the folderthe same way-by picking it up out of the folder and dropping it back on thedesktop.andP;  Object Attributes.andP;  The Object Menu item displays information suchas the object creator, date created, and the number of links an objecthas-the number of parent objects and number of children (objects displayedwithin the object).andP;  The number of links changes only when shared copies aremade.andP;  A third-party vendor, Dexotek, is developing a product that enablesthe user to quickly find objects on the desktop.andP;  When you click on anobject, it win show graphically how and to what die object is linked.andP;  Itwill also find any object on the desktop instantly.andM;OBJECT MANAGEMENT FACILITY.andP;  The NewWave OMF provides a database-likefunction, keeping track of the status and relationships of all objects on thedesktop.andP;  The OMF gives the user ease-of-use and consistency acrossplatforms.andP;  It hides both the operating system and the underlying filingsystem from the user, making the NewWave interface and filing system the sameregardless of operating platform.andM;The OMF provides the following:andM;* Binding of data and applications into objects.andP;  When you create a Lotusspreadsheet, the OMF links the spreadsheet to the Lotus application.andP;  Whenyou double-click on the icon for the spreadsheet object, the OMF knows toactivate Lotus.andP;  Management of information links between objects.andO;Information links are views of data from one object contained in anotherobject.andP;  An example here is a compound document containing a range of cellsfrom a spreadsheet.andP;  If you double-click on the spreadsheet from within thecompound document, the OMF knows to activate Lotus and open the spreadsheet.andO;When you exit from Lotus, you are back in the compound document again.andO;Currently, the OMF only has to keep track of links among one user's objectson the desktop.andP;  No links are maintained across the network.andP;  CreandM;* Horizontal integration.andP;  Every application written to the NewWave APIs gets&quot;instant integration&quot; with all other NewWave-compliant applications.andP;  Once anapplication incorporates the necessary OMF calls, it does not need to knowany-andM;:..:..::  :i:.:.andP;  thing about any other application on the desktop to achieveintegration.andP;  Each application has to know only its own processing and how toexpress itself when asked by the OMF.andP;  The OMF takes care of all of the linksand communication between objects.andM;Thus, the developer can use NewWave applications as interchangeable parts inbuilding more complex or specialized applications.andP;  Horizontal integrationfacilitates the rapid assembly of new applications with the opportunity for asignificant productivity improvement.andP;  Horizontal integration is one ofNewWave's most significant competitive advantages.andM;ENCAPSULATION.andP;  Encapsulation builds a software shell around a non-NewWaveDOS application to allow it to work in an object environment.andP;  This shellessentially provides communication between the application and the OMF andthe agent facility.andP;  Thus, the user does not have to wait for the applicationdeveloper to migrate to the full NewWave environment before incorporating afavorite application program.andP;  This modular approach comes the closest of anywe've seen yet to offering the user the option to choose  best in class&quot; andget at least some minimal level of integration.andM;Both standard DOS and MS Windows applications must be encapsulated to workwithin NewWave.andP;  Encapsulated DOS applications will continue to take over thefull screen; Windows applications will still come up in a window on thedesktop.andP;  Encapsulation is done with the Bridge Builder object and providesthe following:andM;* Binds the data to the application and displays the resulting object as anicon on the desktop, permitting it to be manipulated as a NewWave object.andO;You choose an icon from a library provided by HP, or create your own if youhave the Developers' Kit.andM;* A cut-and-paste option (text or graphics data only) between a DOS objectand other objects on the desktop.andP;  This is done via the Clipboard.andM;* Context-switching between the DOS application and the NewWave desktop.andM;* The ability to include the application in agent tasks.andM;AGENTS.andP;  Agents provide a powerful procedural automation, orcross-application macro facility, within NewWave.andP;  An agent can automateanything you can do within the NewWave environment.andM;An agent task is created by simply recording the steps you want the agent toperform when activated.andP;  You modify the resulting script using the agent tasklanguage; this includes flow control commands such as if/then/else and dowhile (see Illustration 6).andP;  Working with the task language is like learningand using any 4GL.andP;  Context-sensitive help is available as is full dialoguebox capability within agent tasks.andP;  Agents can also be nestedandM;You execute an agent task by dropping it on the Agent tool.andP;  Agent tasks canalso be automatically triggered by an event or a specified date/time.andP;  SinceDOS is single-tasking, you cannot do anything else while the agent completesa task.andP;  In Unix and OS/2, HP will implement multitasking background agenttasks.andM;Availability.andP;  Agents are not yet available in the standalone version ofNewWave.andP;  With Release 1 of NewWave Office, agents will be able to automateInformation Access and AdvanceLink tasks only by executing command files.andO;Release 2 will add the ability to record agent mm, create an agent taskacross multiple applications on the desktop, edit an agent task using thetask language, and set up timed agents.andP;  The capabilities of Release 2 arealready available in the NewWave Developers' Kit but can only be accessed andused within a single application.andM;HELP AND CBT.andP;  NewWave includes a context-sensitive, point-to-screen Helpfunction with hypertext-like capability.andP;  The NewWave CBT lessons teach allelements of the NewWave environment.andP;  They are designed to make even thoseusers who have had no experience whatsoever with windows, mice, or objectsquickly comfortable with NewWave.andP;  The CBT actually drives the live softwarein the system; it is not just a set of screen captures or simulations of thedesktop.andM;NEWWAVE WRITE.andP;  Although NewWave Write is not a sophisticated word processor,it provides an easy-to-use compound document editor.andP;  This is its real valuein addition to basic editing and formatting capabilities.andP;  HP is looking tothird parties to provide high-end WP requirements within the NewWaveenvironment (e.g., Samna's Ami Professional).andP;  Compound Documents.andP;  When youget to a point in the document where you want to include another object, youcopy, move, or share the object into the document.andP;  Live (hot) links betweenobjects in NewWave are created by sharing one object into another.andP;  (Thereare no &quot;warm&quot; links in NewWave; the user is not given the choice of whetheror not to update a linked object.)andM;When you double-click on the object in the document, NewWave opens the objectand activates the application.andP;  (See Illustration 7.) All NewWave Write knowsabout an embedded object is its name, its size, and where it is in thedocument.andP;  When the object is activated, NewWave Write calls the OMF, and theOMF calls the application, instructing it to display itself in a window.andM;The compound document facility only works for full NewWave applications andencapsulated applications that have browsers.andP;  A browser knows how to displaythe data format for a non-NewWave application.andP;  HP has written browsers forLotus and its own Gallery Collection.andP;  If a vendor doesn't want to modify orwrite an application to embed OMF calls, it can instead write a browser (HPprovides specs for this), allowing objects created by the application to beincluded in other objects but not vice versa).andM;When a compound object is mailed, NewWave makes a copy of all linked objectsfor the recipient; no  New links are maintained across the network in thecurrent implementation.andP;  The recipient must have the application locally toedit the linked objects.andP;  The recipient can allow the browser to at leastview Basket and print the data if the application isn't available.andM;DEVELOPER TOOLS.andP;  Effective development tools are a critical factor ingetting ISVs committed to the NewWave platform.andP;  The easier it is to modifyexisting applications and create new ones without writing a lot of code, themore attractive the migration to a new environment.andP;  This is an issue facedby all of the systems vendors as they push new architectures and APIs.andO;Although HP will develop some tools for its specific customer operatingrequirements (e.g., Cobol or transaction processing), it will rely primarilyon third parties for tools.andM;Version 2.0 of the NewWave Developers' Kit for DOS was released in February,adding tools to take full advantage of agents and the CBT facility.andP;  Versionsfor Unix and OS/2 will follow later this year.andM;A number of ISVs are already developing NewWave tools in the DOS environmente.g., Glockenspiel, Caseworks, Systems Interface.andP;  Candlelight Software willintroduce WaveBuilder, a CASE/expert system tool for developing NewWaveapplications from scratch, by mid-1990.andP;  Some, like Glockenspiel, are alsoactive in the Unix and OS/2 arenas.andP;  For Unix, HP is developing some toolsitself, looking at Apollo-developed tools, and recruiting third parties.andM;NewWave Office ExtensionsandM;NETWORK OBJECT-SHARING.andP;  The first major step toward full distributed objectmanagement is sharing objects across the network.andP;  In NewWave Office, objectscan be stored on any server on which a share (virtual drive) can be defined.andM;A network folder (a Network Object Storage object in NewWave) is a containerfor objects stored on a server.andP;  The network folder essentially provides awindow to a server, pointing to a specific share, or subdirectory, on thatserver.andM;You can copy or move an object tO a network server by dropping the object onthe network folder.andP;  In the case of a compound object, all of the embeddedlinked objects are also copied to the server as part of the compound object.andO;Thus, the live links are not maintained across the network to the originalobjects.andP;  Network-wide live links will come with the distributed version ofNewWave.andM;All objects in a network folder are available to anyone with access to theshare.andP;  In addition to copying or moving objects contained in a networkfolder, there is also a check-out/check-in facility.andP;  If you want to work onan object in the folder, you explicitly check out the object; you cannotdouble-click on it to open it.andP;  Once checked out, the object will begrayed-out in the folder.andP;  Another user can now copy the object from thenetwork folder, but cannot open the object in the folder.andP;  And the seconduser will not be allowed to refile the copy in the network folder under thesame name if the original object is still in the folder.andM;You just drop the object back on the network folder to check it in.andP;  You cansee who has checked out an object, and the system administrator can forcesomething to be checked in.andM;Creating a share creates an index on the server to maintain information as towhat objects are stored there, which ones are checked out, and by whom.andP;  Whensomeone drops an object on the network folder, the index is updated and theobject is put on the share in a specially formatted object file.andP;  There isonly one index per share, although it is possible to have multiple networkfolders pointing to the same share (see Illustration 8).andP;  MAIL.andP;  HP OpenMail,HP's standards-based mail server for HP-UX, is the mail transport service forNewWave Office for Unix.andP;  It provides native X.400 P1/P2 compliance, conformsto X/Open portability specs, and uses Sendmail, an established Unix transportsystem, for the transmission of messages.andP;  HP is porting OpenMail to the OS/2server as well.andM;The mail transport on NewWave Office for MPE is the DeskManager mail server,which will interoperate with OpenMail on Unix.andP;  Thus, in a mixed environment,an MPE server can use OpenMail for X.400 connectivity rather than adding onthe MPE X.400 gateway, Office Connect for X.400.andP;  OpenMail will also haveaccess to mail gateways supported by DeskManager (e.g., IBM's PROFS, DISOSS,and HP Telex).andP;  A fax gateway for both DeskManager and OpenMail will shipthis July.andM;HP has well-developed online directory services of its own, and is committedto supporting X.500 on both Unix and MPE in the future.andM;OpenMail is available in English, German, and French; multiple languages canrun concurrently on the same system.andP;  NewWave Mail.andP;  NewWave Mail, theNewWave Office client software for mail, runs only on DOS today.andP;  NewWaveMail uses the InTray and Out-Tray desktop tools plus the distribution listand outgoing envelope objects.andP;  Rather than explicitly invoking a &quot;mail&quot;application to send an object in NewWave, you simply create an object anddrop it on the Out-Tray icon.andP;  Up comes a dialogue box for enteringaddressees.andP;  Then you select whether to mail or hold the object(s).andP;  If youhold them, the envelope is placed on the desktop.andP;  If you mail them, theenvelope can be sent with immediate or deferred delivery.andP;  HP has managed toengineer immediate background delivery of mail on the single-tasking DOSplatform.andP;  While the mail is being sent to the server, you can continue towork.andM;In NewWave, you do not have an automatic option for creating a cover memo orshort message after entering the addressees.andP;  This approach is different forthose of us used to an existing E-mail system.andP;  The idea is to create all ofthe objects to be mailed, and then put them in an envelope and send them.andP;  Acover memo would simply be another object dropped in the envelope.andP;  We would,however, like the option to enter a short cover message after addressing theenvelope, and have this displayed for the recipient when the envelope isopened.andM;Any object on the desktop can be mailed.andP;  You can drop a distribution list onan envelope to address it.andP;  As part of your mail profile, you can specifywhether you want to always mail the original object or have NewWaveautomatically mail a copy.andP;  Other Desktop Options.andP;  AdvanceMail III is thenon-NewWave PC DOS client for both OpenMail and DeskManager.andP;  Unixworkstations and terminals access OpenMail via terminal emulation (whichlooks like AdvanceMail).andP;  In the future, HP will have a Motif-based OpenMailclient for Unix.andP;  PC LAN Mail.andP;  HP is approaching PC LANs from twodirections.andP;  First, it is porting OpenMail to run on PC-based LAN servers.andO;It will be available on SCO Unix/386 in September and on OS/2 by the end ofthe year.andP;  Second, HP is working with 3Com to jointly provide a gatewaybetween OpenMail and 3Com's 3+ Open Mail.andP;  We expect this by year-end.andP;  HPalso supports Novell LAN PCs via the HP NS LAN gateway on MPE.andM;INFORMATION ACCESS.andP;  HP considers its Information Access product a keydifferentiator and an important part of NewWave Office.andP;  It is a trueclient/server application, providing access to both remote and localdatabases.andP;  Currently, the client is a character-based DOS application,encapsulated within NewWave.andP;  It will be NewWave compliant later this year.andO;The server software, available on both MPE and Unix, accesses HP'sAllbase/SQL and Oracle (Unix and MPE), and TurboImage and KSAM (MPE only).andO;Access to IBM's DB2 is available on a custom basis, with full integrationcoming in future releases.andP;  Local PC databases can include Lotus, dBase, andR:base.andM;Access provides read-only access to server databases.andP;  Once you specify theserver, Access then displays the databases you have permission to access.andO;Concurrent access to both remote and local databases is not available yet.andO;However, you can selectively move tables or subsets of tables from one sourceto another, bringing tables together to perform joins on a common server.andM;Queries and Reports.andP;  When selecting columns from multiple tables,Information Access figures out the join column if the columns have the samename.andP;  You can request sample values if you need to know how data is enteredin columns; do a further query on the result or refine the query; sort theresults; calculate summary data (e.g, total, average); select from manyoutput formats (including Lotus, dbase, and R:base); and copy data to theNewWave Clipboard using the Encapsulation menu.andP;  Information Access has itsown report writer and command language, and NewWave agents will be able toaccess procedures written with the command language.andM;DOCUMENT SERVICES.andP;  HP's first NewWave document service will be its AdvancedImage Management System (AIMS), announced this month for delivery to targeteddevelopers in May and for general availability in August.andP;  This toolkit forcreating image-capable applications includes a 4GL and a user-interfacebuilder.andP;  It adheres to the client/server model, with the front end runningon DOS and the server on the UP9000 and SCO Unix/386 platforms.andM;The underpinning for HP AIMS is the Plexus XDP system, which, in turn, usesthe SQL-based Informix database to manage image storage.andP;  HP has addedsupport for HP peripherals and networking, plus the NewWave clientenvironment.andP;  The client HP AIMS software is encapsulated and will eventuallybe a full NewWave application.andP;  HP AIMS supports optical storage devices,including jukeboxes, and CCITT Group 4 image compression.andM;Application development is done on the PC, producing Windows applicationswithout requiring expertise in Windows or C programming.andM;SHARED RESOURCES.andP;  Resource-sharing for NewWave clients (e.g., access tofiles and printers) is provided by MS-Net (MPE), LAN Manager/X (Unix), andLAN Manager (OS/2).andP;  In the initial release of NewWave Office, HP will notinclude LAN Manager/X support on the DOS client.andP;  This will be providedthrough a compatible MS-Net-based OfficeShare client that permits fullshared-resource capability with HP LAN Manager/X.andP;  The LAN Manager/X clientwill come with the second release of NewWave Office for Unix (late 1990) andwill be supported as a separate product this summer.andP;  HP also plans tosupport LAN Manager on MPE in the future.andM;NETWORKED PC MANAGEMENT.andP;  One of HP's primary objectives was to make aNewWave Office LAN easy to install and administer.andP;  Networked PC managementprovides several services to minimize the effort required.andP;  It automaticallyconfigures the server, assigns node names and addresses, identifies sharedperipherals, establishes default public and private shares, and configuresclient software for each networked PC.andP;  All of the software for both theserver and the clients is distributed on a single tape set; the administratorcan download the PC software from the server.andM;NewWave Office also provides important PC backup services.andP;  With an MPEserver, each PC hard disk on the network can be backed up to a tape deviceusing unattended store/ restore.andP;  Backup is initiated by the PC user (not theserver-a DOS limitation) using a menu interface.andP;  The user can choose to backup either entire files or just changes to DOS file data, and can request arestore at any time.andP;  MPE servers can also provide PC hard disk backup forclients connected to Unix and OS/2 servers.andM;Both MPE and Unix servers can automatically back up any DOS files stored onthe server as shared objects during system backup.andM;Future enhancements to NewWave Office system services include unattendedautomation of software distribution for third-party DOS applications, theaddition of utilities to manage PC software usage (e.g., version and licensecontrol), server installation of LAN Manager clients, a graphical userinterface for the administrator, and central control of networks withmultiple LAN servers.andM;PACKAGING.andP;  The user can buy NewWave Office with both mail and InformationAccess or with just one of these services.andP;  With NewWave Office, HP isintroducing user-based pricing.andM;FuturesandM;In addition to the many enhancements we have already mentioned in ourdiscussion of NewWave Office, developments are underway in several othermajor areas.andM;OBJECT TYPES.andP;  HP will incorporate other technologies that are fundamentallyimportant to a full information system.andP;  These include voice (see News andAnalysis, Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  2, for an analysis of HP's Applied ComputerizedTelephony ACT) platform and the impact this will have on voice processing inHP's environment), video, etc.andM;DISTRIBUTED NEWWAVE.andP;  Having the OMF capability at the server level iscritically important to the next generation of NewWave Office.andP;  As you putmultiple NewWave servers on the network, the OMF must begin to communicatewith remote servers.andP;  This requires a server-based OMF-to-OMF communicationfacility, which doesn't exist in the product today.andP;  There must be objectidentification and location mechanisms-methods for finding remote objects,activating them, establishing and maintaining live links across the network,and managing the fife cycle of objects (e.g., how an object is deleted fromthe system).andP;  HP is still in the process of development here.andP;  It is mergingits OMF with Apollo's NCS technology to achieve distributed NewWave.andP;  HP isalso investigating the implementation of warm links.andM;The distributed NewWave concept will not be dependent upon NewWave Office.andO;It will be designed as a general facility with applicability to other areassuch as manufacturing and engineering.andP;  HP intends to license distributedNewWave when it is available.andM;CUSTOMIZABLE INTERFACE.andP;  To make NewWave attractive to users outside theoffice arena, HP intends to implement multiple conceptual models andmetaphors in the Unix and OS/ 2 versions.andP;  The user will be able to choosethe most appropriate environment in which to work: the desktop, a productionline, a CAD workbench, etc.andM;PRESENTATION INDEPENDENCE.andP;  Requiring the developer to write to both theNewWave and the window manager APIs can be a problem for developers workingon multiple operating platforms.andP;  A company whose product runs on both OS/2and Unix must write the product not only to NewWave but also to theunderlying windowing manager-Motif on Unix and PM on OS/2.andP;  This makes forextra work and limits the portability/ scalability of the development effort.andM;HP is working with third parties to develop a layer of software that fitsbetween the NewWave environment and the windowing manager to providepresentation independence.andP;  This would allow the developer to write only tothe NewWave APIs.andP;  The additional layer of software would take care ofadapting to the appropriate underlying windowing manager, making thedevelopers' job much easier.andP;  This would go a long way to attracting thirdparties to the NewWave environment, a critical factor in HP's strategy.andM;PRESENTATION/SEMANTIC SPLIT.andP;  HP's ultimate goal is to separate thepresentation or interface from the semantic objects in the environment.andP;  (Asemantic object is one that manipulates data, such as a database manager.) Inan object-oriented environment, objects communicate through messages., Oneobject sends a message to another object: &quot;express yourself.&quot; The objectexpresses itself and sends back a message to the requesting object.andP;  Theobjects never touch each other, an &quot;ask, don't touch&quot; approach.andP;  Therefore,objects do not need to know intimate details about each other and what theyare or do.andP;  Each object only needs to have an understanding of how itinterprets and executes standard messages.andM;As an object in the system, the interface would keep track of the screenlayout and movements on the screen.andP;  These movements would be formulated intomessages and then sent to the appropriate semantic object(s), which could belocated on the same workstation or on a remote workstation/server.andO;Separating the interface from other objects, such as a mail server,facilitates the existence of multiple presentation objects, each representinga different look-and-feel and/or behavior.andM;HP has, in fact, demonstrated this, allowing a presentation object under OS/2and one under Unix to display a single semantic object residing on a Unixserver.andM;WORKGROUP APPLICATIONS.andP;  HP has had much demand for calendar/schedulingcapabilities within NewWave Office.andP;  It is developing an interface to theDeskManager time management function for MPE and extending OpenMail toinclude a scheduling capability.andP;  The front-end software would be the samefor both.andM;Another top priority enhancement is mail-enabled applications, such as serialrouting and electronic authorization.andP;  HP feels these will have a strongimpact on customer demand in conjunction with X.400 and EDI capabilities.andO;With OpenMail ported to a broad range of platforms, the customer win be ableto put into place an enterprise-wide communication system with significantadded value.andP;  HP sees this as an important differentiator for the company.andM;ConclusionsandM;HP's stake in the ground is leadership in object-based information managementand a strong emphasis on the Unix server platform.andP;  HP's significant newserver products-OpenMail, ACT and AIMS-are both Unix-based, and NewWaveOffice for Unix is getting equal billing with MPE.andP;  HP is very serious aboutits push for de facto acceptance of OpenMail and NewWave as industrystandards.andM;When you talk to UP about Fortune 500 accounts, the problem seems to begetting in the door (past the inevitable Digital VAXs and a cacophony of IBMsystems), not staying in once the presence is established.andP;  We see HP usingNewWave and NewWave Office as a way to get in that door, a first step that HPhopes will quietly lead to its becoming a pervasive business environment andcommunications platform.andP;  Using the desktop/user as a design center may proveto be a key factor in HP's success.andP;  Giving the user easy access toenterprise-wide information and analysis/decision-making tools, while at thesame time helping MIS with its control and security issues, makes for a happycustomer.andM;It turns out that HP, like IBM and Digital, is going after theinfrastructure.andP;  The difference between HP and IBM is that IBM hasn't evenclearly articulated its strategy for AIX, let alone introduced products.andO;Digital has a coherent strategy with a commitment to comparable NAS (NetworkApplications Support) services across VMS and Ultrix, but it hasn't yetvalidated the strategy with an integrated set of products.andP;  When Ken Olsenstates that he doesn't consider Unix an open platform, we have to believethat sentiment filters down through the company, making the Ultrix sell allthe more difficult within Digital, not to mention to the customer.andP;  And thefledgling client software for All-In-1 has a way to go before it can competewith NewWave's functionality and ease of use.andM;HP's solution is based on a powerful RISC/Unix platform for commercialapplications; a commitment to a distributed, cooperative computingenvironment; an appealing desktop metaphor (ultimately customizable);interoperability between HP's proprietary, Unix, and other strategicoperating systems; and a strong set of tools for integrating applications.andO;HP is certainly poised to give both IBM and Digital a run for the money inthe Unix environment.andP;  As for winning the war for the enterprisecommunications backbone, a lot depends on HP's implementation of distributedNewWave, support for workgroups, and the availability of a broad range ofthird-party tools and applications.andP;  Keep a close watch on HP.andP;  We sure will.andM;Can HP Sell NewWave as an Industry  Standard?andM;HP WANTS TO SEE NewWave adopted as a de facto industry standard and has twoprimary efforts underway.andP;  In addition to offering NewWave for licensing toother vendors (see OEMS), HP would like to see the NewWave Object ManagementFacility (OMF) adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG).andO;The OMG also has an agreement with X/Open, allowing X/Open to incorporateOMG-approved standards where appropriate in the X/Open Common ApplicationsEnvironment (CAE), and OMG specs into future versions of the X/OpenPortability Guide (XPG).andP;  As X/Open gains credibility, it will provide a bigboost to the acceptance of the OMG's efforts.andM;Adoption of a standard object management model is one of the primary goals ofthe OMG.andP;  This will provide the foundation for heterogeneous object-sharingand avoid the development of multiple object models in the industry.andP;  Theobject model will include standards for object definition, class libraries,and facilities for managing, accessing, and working with objects.andP;  Althoughthe NewWave OMF does not have any real competitors at this point for what itoffers, it does not yet provide a full object model.andP;  For example, the OMFlacks inheritance and distributed object facilities, features that are ofmajor interest to the OMG.andP;  Therefore, we expect a compromise of some kind,with OMG members in addition to HP contributing to the final standard.andM;COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.andP;  By allowing other vendors to license NewWave, isn'tHP giving up a significant competitive advantage? The answer is no, since HPis not giving its crown jewels, the NewWave source code, to licensees.andM;THE PRESSURE is ON.andP;  The existence of a well-designed, object-oriented userenvironment like NewWave places enormous pressure on other vendors in theindustry once customers understand the advantages NewWave gives them overmore traditional approaches to office systems.andP;  Do these vendors invest inthe time and effort to develop and implement their own object model, or dothey succumb to HP's success and then figure out how to differentiatethemselves from other vendors also using NewWave?andM;One area of leverage for HP is the development time spent on NewWave.andP;  Oneestimate we've heard is 500 man-years.andP;  Although HP has already workedthrough many complex issues, and although the existence of its NewWavesolution would potentially make the development effort easier for someoneelse, the development time concern certainly doesn't become trivial.andP;  UPstates that a large portion of its NewWave development time was devoted tothe OMF.andP;  It would take considerable time and extensive expertise for acompetitor to duplicate this effort.andM;Uniplex Extends OpenMail's HorizonsandM;A MAJOR FACET of HP's strategy is to license OpenMail to other Unix vendorsin an effort to make it the de facto Unix mail system.andP;  Uniplex, with itsstrong integrated office offering, was a natural target and the first to grabthe OpenMail offering.andP;  In January, HP and Uniplex announced an agreementfrom which both will reap significant benefits.andM;Uniplex will integrate OpenMail as the mail transport into its Uniplex Officeproduct by early 1991, replacing its own mail system.andP;  OpenMail will providekey enhancements for Uniplex-improved directory management and systemmanagement, native X.400 capability, and interoperability with other standardUnix mad systems.andM;HP gets the major benefits from this relationship.andP;  First, HP will sell thefull Uniplex Office product line on the HP platform, except the Uniplex DOSsoftware.andP;  Since NewWave Office doesn't address server applications forterminal users, Uniplex Office will fill this gap for HP.andP;  OpenMail on bothplatforms will ensure mail interoperability for all users.andM;Second, Uniplex represents the firs and largest &quot;domino&quot; in the Unix arena inHP's quest to establish OpenMail as a de facto standard on open systems.andO;Since Uniplex Office runs on over 200 Unix platforms, this alone will give HPa strong presence on a wide variety of systems.andM;Third, Uniplex is assisting HP in porting OpenMail as a standalone product tothe top 20 or so Unix platforms-Sun, IBM's AIX, Digital's Ultrix, etc.andP;  Thisgives HP a foot in the door and a great opportunity to compete for theenterprise communication backbone in Unix.andP;  Having a single mail systemaccepted across multiple platforms overcomes the problems inherent in tryingto integrate directory, administration, and file exchange services acrossdisparate mail systems.andP;  An interesting note here is the fact that HP'sOpenMail will arrive on IBM's and Digital's doorsteps (this summer) beforethey introduce their own Unix mail products.andP;  (Digital does have mail withinDECwindows, but this is not its new X.400 offering yet.)andO;</TEXT></DOC>
