(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush, sharing a platform withHouse Speaker Tom Foley at a centennial tree-planting ceremony,prodded the Democratic-controlled Congress on Tuesday to move morequickly on his clean-air proposals.   Bush challenged Democratic leaders to finish work on his proposedoverhaul of the Clean Air Act of 1974 this year _ a target Foley,the nation's top-ranking elected Democrat, had called possible but``unlikely.''   Suggesting his legislation had been languishing in House andSenate committees, Bush declared, ``Every day that passes is anotherday we're postponing progress on clean air.''   To a crowd of several thousand sprawled on the banks of theSpokane River under bright skies in Foley's hometown, Bush said,``We need action on the legislation we've proposed _ now.   ``We've brought people together and put a sound proposal on thetable. Now it's up to Congress to pass this clean-air legislationthis year.''   Bush's proposals call for tougher standards on acid rain, urbansmog and industrial emissions.   In Washington, the president's backers won an important victoryin the envrionment subcommittee of the House Energy and CommerceCommittee. A 12-10 vote turned rejected an amendment to thepresident's clean air package backed by environmental groups thatBush supporters argued would be too tough on cities and smallbusinesses.   The Democratic chairman of the parent committee, Rep. JohnDingell of Michigan, is backing the president's plan.   Meanwhile, the president issued in a statement expressing``concern and sympathy'' for victims of Hurricane Hugo. SpokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said ``all necessary federal resources will bequickly mobilized to help the people of the Virgin Islands andPuerto Rico recover from this disaster.''   In advance of Bush's speech, Foley said that the House planned tomove forward on Bush's clean-air legislation but that action thisyear was ``possible but unlikely.''   ``If I were prudent, I would say early next year,'' Foley toldreporters Monday, also predicting that the House would modify theproposal.   Bush, accompanied by Environmental Protection Administrationchief William Reilly, made the excursion into Foley's congressionaldistrict for a ceremony marking Washington's 100th anniversary as astate. It was the final stop on a two-day swing that includedsimilar centennial observations in South Dakota and Montana.   Foley, who told the crowd Bush's visit was ``a proud moment forthe state of Washington,'' sat impassively through the president'sremarks directed at Congress. But the speaker clapped politely whenBush's call for action this year prompted a wave of applause fromthe crowd.   Despite needling the Democratic leadership, Bush praised Foley inthe speech as ``a man of integrity, decency, fair play. OK, he's aDemocrat. But he's a man I am very proud to be able to work with.''   Flying back to Washington aboard Air Force One, Foley toldreporters, ``I don't think the president really expects that everytime he should send a proposal to the Congress, we would justautomatically say, `Well, this is better than anyone could possibleimprove on, therefore we'll enact it without any question or withoutany additions.'''   Asked about Bush's complaint Monday that the Democrats' responseto his drug strategy and other initiatives is always to ``spend moreand raise taxes,'' Foley replied:   ``Well, with the greatest respect since I'm flying in hisairplane, I don't agree with the suggestion that we are trying totax more or to spend more.''   Foley also said he thinks Bush will eventually lose the fightover reducing the capital gains tax, despite the president's initialvictory in the House Ways and Means Committee.   ``We're going to do our best on the floor of the House and theSenate to defeat the proposal, which I think is unwise andill-timed, unfair. ... This is one in which the president and wehave a very clear disagreement. And we'll have an alternativeproposal to consider when it reaches the House floor.''   Bush, who has planted a tree and stressed environmental themes ateach stop, called for ``a new environmental awareness on the part ofall Americans.''   Saying pollution isn't caused just by power plants and largeindustries, Bush proposed a major volunteer effort on the part ofall Americans to ``generate less wastes and recycle more of thewaste that is generated.''   He said the ``opportunity to renew the environmental ethic inAmerica'' was ``an opportunity we can't afford to miss.''   ``I plan to stay involved, helping to protect our preciousenvironment, as long as I am president,'' he asserted.   Bush's clean-air proposals were announced June 12 but notformally submitted to Congress until July 21.   The package calls for a 10-billion-ton reduction in sulfurdioxide emissions from power plant and other industrial stacks bythe year 2000.   Sulfur dioxide pollution drifts in the atmosphere with prevailingwinds and returns to earth as acid rain.   Bush's plan also calls for a 2-million-ton reduction in nitrogenoxide emissions and a 40 percent reduction in hydrocarbon emissions,which produce urban smog.   Bush, as he has done in other centennial states, planted inSpokane's Riverfront Park _ site of a 1974 world's fair _ a saplingfrom a White House elm planted by President John Quincy Adams in1828.   In Washington, meanwhile, the administration proposed amodification in the provision of its clean-air bill that wouldpermit automakers to average auto emissions to meet anti-pollutionrequirements.   The modification, criticized by environmental groups, would stillallow motor vehicle manufacturers to meet stricter anti-pollutionrequirements by averaging pollution among engine families.   But it would make clear that reductions under averaging mustequal the improvement that would be achieved if each model wereforced to meet the emissions standards. Current law requires eachmodel to meet the standards.</TEXT></DOC>
