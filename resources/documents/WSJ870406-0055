Talk costs less than intervention, and traders say it may be having some effect.    Frustrated by the dollar's recent drop despite a multibillion-dollar effort to support it, Japan's Ministry of Finance is turning to verbal persuasion to try to influence the market, foreign-exchange dealers say.    Traders and news reports from Tokyo say Finance Ministry officials are making personal pleas to Japanese financial institutions to refrain from selling dollars in the foreign-exchange market.    &quot;This is the Japanese equivalent of moral suasion,&quot; Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International, New York, says. &quot;They haven't put their foot down&quot; and said traders can't sell dollars, he says of the officials. &quot;They're just sort of hounding (the traders).&quot;    A Finance Ministry spokesman, however, denies that any such activity is taking place.    Nevertheless, the reports are credited with helping the dollar stay well above the post-World War II low of 144.70 yen that it touched last Monday.    &quot;Just as important as whether or not (the Finance Ministry) is really doing it is the fact that people think that they're doing it,&quot; James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, says.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 146.10 yen, off slightly from 146.44 Thursday.    Since the dollar's two-year slump steepened late last month, Japan has led a $10 billion intervention effort to support the U.S. currency. Together with central banks from five other major industrial nations, it has been selling yen to purchase dollars under a February agreement to stabilize exchange rates.    Although the dollar bounced up from its lows last week, its decline actually steepened during the previous week, which was the time of the heaviest intervention. That led Japanese officials last week to pressure Japanese banks, securities firms and insurance companies not to speculate against the dollar, according to bank sources cited in reports from Tokyo.    The reports also say the Finance Ministry is asking Japanese banks for early disclosure of details about their currency transactions for March, a request seen as subtle intimidation.    Mr. Vick says Manufacturers Hanover's own sources in Tokyo corroborate the reports. &quot;The Japanese government seems to be appealing to patriotism and Japanese honor to do what is right for the country, which of course is not to sell the dollar,&quot; he says.    The dollar's drop against the yen has hurt Japanese industry by making its products more costly to Americans and reducing export revenue. Its drop has been intensified in part by selling pressure from Japanese financial institutions seeking to avoid further losses on dollar-denominated investments.    &quot;Within Japan, there's a tremendous conflict between the savers and investors and the non-financial (manufacturing) companies,&quot; Mr. Brusca says.    But while some traders say the reports of Japanese government pressure have built a short-term base of support for the dollar, most don't believe it will work in the long run.    &quot;It's sort of like intervention; if it goes against the grain, it's likely to fail,&quot; Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel andamp; Co., London, says.    The chief trader in New York for a Tokyo-based bank agrees. &quot;Even if Japanese investors don't sell dollars, somebody else will,&quot; he says. &quot;The trend is inevitable . . . unless the government has authority over the whole world.&quot;    The Japanese trader, who asked for anonymity, doesn't dismiss the government's efforts, however.    &quot;If you are Japanese,&quot; he says, &quot;you quickly understand that to some extent, every company has a relationship with the government. So their request is something we have to think about.&quot;    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar finished mixed against other major currencies. Market sentiment remained bearish, but trading was cautious ahead of this week's meeting in Washington of monetary officials from major industrial countries.    The dollar was under early downward pressure on news that U.S. unemployment for March fell to 6.6%. Traders had been expecting the jobless rate to be unchanged at 6.7%. But the currency rebounded on covering of short, or oversold, positions and reports of intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    Tokyo traders earlier reported apparent intervention by the Bank of Japan.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8248 West German marks, compared with 1.8139 the day before. The British pound firmed to $1.6120 from $1.6070.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery rose $1.70 an ounce to $419.70 in moderate trading estimated at three million ounces.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, April 3, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
