At 90 deg C the strengthof irradiated samples increases by 80% reaching the maximum at the absorbedradiation dose of 0.1 MGr. Such strength increase in irradiated samplesis provided by the formation of a continuous three-dimentional grid containingchemical nodes (of covalent bonds) and physical nodes (supermolecularcrystal formations).</TEXT></DOC>
