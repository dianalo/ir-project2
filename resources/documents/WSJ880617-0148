President Reagan and his counterparts from Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, are likely to spend a lot of their time congratulating one another. They will celebrate the fact that their economies are still growing eight months after the stock market crash, that the trade deficit of the U.S. and the surpluses of Germany and Japan have started to shrink, and that currency markets have been relatively stable for months.    Aware that no new major economic initiatives are likely in a U.S. election year, they will be content to urge the removal of &quot;structural rigidities,&quot; or microeconomic roadblocks to growth. And they will take modest steps toward bolstering economic-policy coordination, keeping trade negotiations moving forward, and chipping away at the Third World debt problem.    It's likely that the leaders will put off until next year major new initiatives on nearly every key international economic problem that economists and business leaders say must be solved soon. These include the U.S. budget deficit, Germany's slow growth and high unemployment, Japanese trade barriers, the plight of large middle-income debtor countries, the oversubsidized world agriculture system, and the problem of injecting more stability into the world monetary system.    &quot;It's all going to be pushed off onto the agenda of the next president,&quot; says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., who was the summit planner for Presidents Ford and Carter and also served in that role during the early Reagan years. &quot;Reagan's at the end of the line, and everybody else knows it.&quot;    Indeed, U.S. officials hope the meeting can be, at least in part, a celebration of Mr. Reagan's presidency. In a string of news briefings over the past week, administration officials have stressed the theme that in 1981, at his first such meeting, Mr. Reagan was scorned for his ideas about tax overhaul, deregulation, and other economic matters. Now, they say, he's staged a record economic boom and is being copied by all the other leaders. &quot;They thought his agenda was quaint and odd,&quot; says W. Allen Wallis, the U.S. undersecretary of state who is the chief American summit planner. &quot;Now, it's all they talk about doing.&quot;    The president also will bask in his recent Moscow summit meeting, briefing the other leaders about his talks with Mikhail Gorbachev. And the summit communique is expected to express strong support for the twin pillars of the Reagan administration's international economic policy: close coordination of economic policies and a cautious, market-oriented approach to the debts of the biggest Third World nations.    Two summit agenda items, agriculture and African debt, are likely to generate much attention, but progress on both will be limited because of fierce differences between the U.S. and European nations.    On agriculture, the U.S. wanted the summit to call for a phase-out of world farm subsidies. But the European Community has dug in its heels against the plan. If anything, the two sides have hardened their positions in recent months, and the summit is likely to adopt only mushy language calling for progress.    On African debt, France and Britain are pressing the U.S. to join them in forgiving many of the loans owed by the poorest sub-Saharan countries. But the Reagan administration has declared it won't do that, and will consider only extending the loans.    The U.S. merely will agree to permit Europe to write off its loans, and to endorse general language encouraging debt relief in Africa. Further, the White House has insisted on summit language making it clear that this approach applies only to the very poor countries, whose debt is mostly to other governments -- not the richer debtors in Latin America, who owe their debts to banks and are the heart of the problem.    On international economic coordination, the summit is likely to approve the use by the countries' finance ministers of a new commodity price index that will include gold. And it will likely empower the ministers, in their periodic reviews of their economies, to deal with structural barriers to growth as well as macroeconomic policy matters.    The nation's finance ministers -- but not the heads of state -- also may begin discussions on the question of Western lending to the Soviet Union. But, again, no policy decisions are likely.    The summit likely will endorse U.S. efforts to put together a major aid package for the Philippines with Japanese help, but no details will be completed.    There will be calls for better cooperation on halting the laundering of drug money and discouraging airplane hijackings and other terrorist acts. </TEXT></DOC>
