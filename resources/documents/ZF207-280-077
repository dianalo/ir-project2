 Anthropomorphism softens technology and makes it easier toaccept, but it also reveals something fundamental: Next to facial expressionand gesture, the most basic form of human communication is speech.andP;  If peopleare ever to communicate freely with their computers, those computers mustrecognize and &quot;understand&quot; the human voice.andP;  Speech recognition is acornerstone of a next-generation human interface, and Articulate Systems'Voice Navigator is the first effective, commercial Macintosh implementationof a key component.andM;Understanding what the Voice Navigator does, however, requires a certainamount of downshifting.andP;  It will be a long time before a computer can hold aconversation the way we've seen it happen in the movies.andP;  It will takecomputing horsepower and artificial intelligence programming well beyond thereach of today's mainframes.andM;Voice Navigator is a combination of hardware and software, simply designed sothat across applications, those functions best suited to voice are in factvoice-driven (selecting menus, commands, tools, and some cursor control).andO;Those operations best suited to the keyboard and mouse (text entry andprecision cursor control) are left to those input devices.andP;  In this way,speech can become an essential part of the human interface long before thetechnological evolution required to create HAL 9000.andM;FIRST NOISESandM;The principals of Articulate Systems, Incorporated (ASI) began investigatingvoice recognition on the Mac in 1986, but even among the design team, whichincluded programmers experienced in the writing of sophisticated Mac code,there was some skepticism about the practical use of such a device.andP;  Othercompanies had tried voice systems before, but the approach had always beenvertical: a specific interface for a specific application.andP;  ASI opted for amore ambitious course, aiming for a general interface that would work withinany application, including the Finder.andP;  Decisions were also made about howthe Voice Navigator would recognize speech.andP;  Dictation was dropped at theoutset, because the Mac isn't powerful enough to make dictation viable (nopersonal computer is yet).andP;  The platform also meant that recognition wouldhave to be based on discrete utterance, that is, commands separated byminimum silences, as opposed to continuous recognition, which poses greaterchallenges still.andM;There was also the question of form -- whether the hardware portion of VoiceNavigator would be a box or a board.andP;  While a NuBus implementation would havebeen cheaper to build, ASI didn't want to limit its market to the Mac II, sothey decided to make it a SCSI box.andM;YOU SAY IT, MAC DOES ITandM;Voice Navigator's work starts with microphone input (from an external mike,its own internal mike, or even a telephone).andP;  This signal passes through ananalog/digital converter and is then sent to an internal digital signalprocessing (DSP) chip for filtering and compression.andP;  This compressed signalis then passed to the Mac for recognition.andP;  As powerful as the VoiceNavigator hardware is, it's actually the Mac CPU that still does most of thework.andM;For recognition to take place, the user must have already &quot;taught&quot; the VoiceNavigator how he pronounces each discrete command (this training can be donefrom within an application, but the majority of commands are recordedbeforehand).andP;  ASI's system is speaker dependent and will work with anylanguage or accent.andP;  The user says the word, and the Voice Navigator'ssoftware creates a template of that utterance.andP;  If a word is repeated severaltimes during the teaching session, the template becomes more generalized,increasing the recognition rate.andP;  Command sets, which are saved like anyother file, are application specific, but they can be transferred betweenprograms that have similar commands (MacDraft and MacDraw, for example).andP;  Tokeep the command files as small as possible, ASI compresses the signal,reducing an average word to 400 bytes and a 1,000-command file to 400K.andM;Once the templates have been set up, the program looks for a best match andthen executes that command.andP;  But since not every utterance will matchperfectly, the user can specify a &quot;minimum confidence level&quot; required for acommand actually to be carried out.andM;Earlier speech-recognition systems often failed because of their limitedvocabularies; ASI's solution is a hierarchical system.andP;  Voice Navigator'scommand vocabulary is only limited by level, so depending on which model youuse, you can have 200 (or 1,000) usable commands at the menu level, another200 (or 1,000) if one of those menu commands has a dialog box or pop-outmenu, and so on.andP;  This approach increases flexibility and lets the user placeany command at any level.andP;  So a frequently used dialog box option, even ifburied three or four levels down, can be placed on the main menu level,making it instantly available.andP;  The unlimited vocabulary also permitssynonyms, so &quot;Undo,&quot; &quot;Scratch that,&quot; and &quot;Forget it&quot; could all do the samething, which, conversationally, is much more natural.andM;The wide vocabulary also permits a certain amount of context sensitivity.andO;For example, in the Finder, saying &quot;Left&quot; can mean &quot;move the cursorcontinuously to the left,&quot; but &quot;Move left&quot; can mean &quot;move the cursor tenpixels to the left,&quot; while &quot;Scroll left&quot; can mean &quot;scroll the window to theleft.&quot;andP;  The modifiers provide the context.andM;TALKING TO THE FUTUREandM;ASI's Voice Navigator is the first commercial example of a voice interfacefor the Macintosh, and its implications are staggering.andP;  For interactivesystems, it could swiftly become the interface of choice, freeing the userfrom the keyboard and even the mouse.andP;  Voice recognition will increasecomputer accessibility among the disabled, and it could even change theconventional notion of what a file is.andM;The Voice Navigator isn't restricted to command execution.andP;  It can also beused as a record and playback device, so voice annotation is now possible.andP;  Adoctor updating a patient's record, for example, could digitize his commentsand save them as an appended file that could be played back with just aclick.andM;While it isn't HAL 9000, the Voice Navigator is a major advance in thehumanization of computer technology -- the ultimate goal of a next-generationinterface.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
