(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of households tuned to theJimmy Swaggart ministry's weekly show dropped by 200,000 inFebruary 1988 compared to the previous year, but it held on to thetop spot among religious broadcasts, according to a televisionrating service.   Viewership for Swaggart's weekly program dropped from 2.161million households in February 1987 to 1.961 million this year,figures released by Arbitron on Saturday indicate.   It was on Feb. 21 that Swaggart admitted to sinning against hiswife and family in a tearful confession from the pulpit at hisBaton Rouge Family Worship Center. Although Swaggart did notspecify his sin, it reportedly involved a New Orleans prostitute.   The Pentecostal minister resigned from the Assemblies of Godchurch on Friday, the same day national church officials moved todefrock him.   He said he was leaving the denomination because his $140 millionper year ministry could not survive if he accepted a one-yearpreaching ban imposed by national Assemblies officials.   Swaggart also said Friday he would stay out of the pulpit untilMay 22nd in accordance with a three-month preaching ban proposed bythe Assemblies' Louisiana elders. He led the choir in his BatonRouge church on Sunday, but did not offer a sermon.   How Swaggart's television ministry has been affected by thescandal will be more accurately measured when new Arbitron figuresfor May are released this summer.   In February's ratings, his daily program ``A Study in the Word''fell from 410,000 households to 323,000 households. It is ratedNo.10 in religious programming, the results show.   Swaggart's audience fell by 200,000 households or 10 percentduring the year for the weekly program and by 87,000 households or22 percent on a daily basis, according to Arbitron.   Most of the top ten television evangelists lost ground duringthe one-year period. No.3 ``World Tomorrow'' was the only Top Tenshow that grew, from 1.14 million households last year to 1.286million this year.   The Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell's show dropped 40percent. The PTL program, once hosted by defrocked Assemblies ofGod minister Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy, did not crack the Top20. It was rated No. 18 in November 1987, when the last ratingswere taken.   Television is the primary source of revenue for Swaggart'sministry and the endeavor on which the most money is spent. Theministry's own figures show it spends twice as much money ontelevision time as on foreign missions.   Ministry literature, which claimed a worldwide viewership of 510million in 1986, now claims 300 million.   In mid-March, Swaggart's wife Frances and son Donnie hosted aweek-long telethon during which they begged viewers to send moneyor use their credit cards to make donations to keep the BatonRouge-based ministry alive.</TEXT></DOC>
