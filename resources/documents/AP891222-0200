The resolution, adopted by consensus, denounces driftnet fishingas ``a highly indiscriminate and wasteful fishing method which iswidely considered to threaten the effective conservation of livingmarine resources.''   Driftnets stretch up to 30 miles, scooping up all fish and othermarine life. Dolphins, porpoises, sea birds and unwanted fish arekilled along with the desired catch.   Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have made extensive use of thenets in the Pacific Ocean to catch squid. More than 1,000 shipsfrom many nations, including France, Spain and Italy, use the netsworldwide.   The U.N. resolution recommends driftnet fishing be scaled downimmediately in the South Pacific and ended there by July 1, 1991.It says a worldwide ban should go into effect on June 30, 1992.   While not binding, the resolution will probably gain widecompliance, diplomats say. Japan, considered the biggest user ofdrift nets, has already announced it will stop.   The ban, the resolution added, could be waived in a region``should effective conservation and management measures be taken.''   Small-scale use of driftnets in coastal waters would beexcluded. The resolution said such fishing is important to theeconomies of developing countries.</TEXT></DOC>
