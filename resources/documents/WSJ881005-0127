The unleashing of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil into the marketplace by the Saudis has already depressed oil prices. As members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries scramble to sell their crude, discounting has become the rule rather than the exception. &quot;It's become a real domino effect,&quot; one OPEC official said.    For instance, Saudi Arabia's offer to cut the price it charges Japanese buyers of large quantities of crude has put pressure on other oil producers to do the same. Iran, in negotiations with some Japanese companies the past three days, has had to reduce its asking price, a person familiar with the negotiations said. The Iranians reportedly made an agreement with a Japanese concern to sell one grade of their crude for 35 cents a barrel less than the spot price for Oman crude. That was 10 cents less than the price charged for that Iranian crude in the third quarter.    &quot;It's a game of chicken, and the Saudis must be prepared to go all the way,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, an independent consultant to OPEC based in Vienna. &quot;Arab light is the cheapest crude in Europe and the Far East; the Saudis are trying to show they can outdo everyone else.&quot;    Nevertheless, oil prices were steady yesterday. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in November finished unchanged at $13.05 a barrel. Most of the buying, however, was by traders who had sold oil in anticipation of lower prices and had to buy some back to cover their needs.    &quot;Every time the market rallied, traders who had shorted the market jumped in and bought,&quot; said John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Mr. O'Dea said he believes that oil prices will continue to skid.    Saudi Arabia's move to &quot;shock&quot; OPEC members into ending their overproduction and honoring the 13-nation group's output quotas is being felt already, according to Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Julio Cesar Gil. At a news conference in Caracas, Mr. Gil said lower oil prices will &quot;undoubtedly&quot; affect Venezuela's ability to service its foreign debt. The output war could cause oil prices to tumble to $10 a barrel, the Venezuelan said. But he predicted that prices wouldn't remain at such a low level for long.    OPEC and industry officials hope the price war can be brought to an end this month when the cartel's price-monitoring committee and its long-term strategy committee meet jointly. Although a date hasn't yet been confirmed by all participants, the group is aiming for an Oct. 20 session, perhaps in Madrid, where the pricing committee met just last week. The joint meeting will bring together eight of OPEC's 13 members, including former war foes Iran and Iraq.    Saudi Arabia's strategy of overproduction is particularly aimed at Iraq, which some say triggered the current price war by refusing to comply with its OPEC production quota after it recently ceased hostilities with Iran. During the nearly eight-year Iran-Iraq war, Iraq was permitted to produce as much oil as it could to finance its war effort.    Saudi Arabia desperately wants to get Iraq and Iran back in a well-disciplined OPEC fold before the two nations can rebuild and gather strength.    OPEC producers fear that &quot;the markets will eventually be awash with oil now that the war is over and installations can be repaired,&quot; said David Mizrahi, publisher of New York-based Mid-East Report.    The Saudis may also be putting pressure on Iran to negotiate an official end to its war with Iraq in good faith. There is some concern, Mr. Mizrahi said, that Iran may be taking advantage of the current cease-fire to rebuild its war capability. &quot;Iran has been trying to hire fighter pilots and reinforce its air force,&quot; Mr. Mizrahi said.    &quot;Iran and Iraq are potentially powerful and threatening, both militarily and economically,&quot; said Frederick Axelgard, an Iraq specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. &quot;The Arab Gulf states must tread cautiously.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
