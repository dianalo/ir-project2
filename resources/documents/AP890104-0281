Perez said Wednesday's visit with new Mexican president CarlosSalinas de Gortari is part of a effort by Latin American leaders tofind a reasonable solution to the debt problem.   ``We seek agreement among Latin American countries to findreasonable solutions with our creditors,'' Perez told reportersbefore speaking to Salinas. ``We seek agreement in search of anunderstanding and not confrontation.''   Venezuela on Saturday suspended payments on a large chunk of its$35 billion foreign debt, claiming it was short of money because oflow prices for crude oil. Mexico is trying to renegotiate paymentson its $106 billion debt, the second largest after Brazil amongdeveloping countries.   Both nations say that debt payments are eating so much money thatthey don't have enough left for investment and economic growth.   Perez and Salinas also discussed oil, a major source of foreignrevenues for both nations.   ``Our countries have suffered the buffeting of the fall inprices, but in my meeting with the president of Mexico, CarlosSalinas de Gortari, I expressed to him my optimism about thepossibilities of a stablization of the petroleum market soon,''Perez told a news conference Wednesday night before leaving thecountry.   He also announced that this week he would travel to Brazil for asimilar meeting with President Jose Sarney.   Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, a 13-nation cartel that has faced trouble inbolstering prices.   Mexico, the world's sixth largest exporter, is not a member ofOPEC but follows the cartel's guidelines. About half the oil thatPemex, the Mexican state petroleum monopoly, sells abroad goes tothe United States.   Perez said if no solution is found to the debt problem, thesevere economic difficulties currently afflicting Venezuela, Braziland Mexico will extend to more countries.   Perez said debt negotiations ``should be bilateral, but thecountries should seek to strengthen our bargaining power through theestablishment of a single Latin American position.''   ``I don't want to turn into a lawyer for the banks, but the banksare tied by the policies established by the (U.S.) TreasuryDepartment and the Federal Reserve ... and that is why it isessential that we ask the U.S. government to change its attitude,''Perez said.   Perez said he was optimistic OPEC will be able to keep pricesfrom falling further, but he described the debt as ``a vise on theeconomy'' of Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
