This morning's commute went ``perfectly,'' said Chris Knapton, aspokesman for Metra, the Chicago-area commuter rail agency thatbuys service from Candamp;NW.   ``All the trains are running on time,'' Knapton said.   Friday's evening rush hour was disrupted by a one-day strike ofthe 2,600 members of the United Transportation Union. The strikewas ended Friday night by a congressionally imposed settlement, butPresident Reagan signed the bill too late to allow usual trainservice to resume.   The Candamp;NW serves about 41,000 commuters in suburban Chicago andhas freight operations in 10 states.   Railroad officials were forced to scramble to put together traincrews because about half the Candamp;NW conductors failed to report forwork once Reagan signed the bill.   ``We told all our members to go back to work when the presidentsigned the emergency board recommendations'' approved by the Houseand Senate, said Robert Reppe Jr., president of UTU Local 577,which represents 382 Chicago-area brakemen and conductors.   Trains began running on schedule Saturday as union members wentback to their jobs, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
