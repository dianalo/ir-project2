The 225-189 roll call reflected a concerted effort by theDemocratic leadership and underscored the continuedvulnerability of major strategic weapons despite the currentcrisis in the Mideast.</LP><TEXT>   The Iraqi threat was invoked by both sides in the debateto bolster their opposing arguments, and a large portion ofthe SDI savings is expected to be reallocated to meetconventional-force needs in the Persian Gulf operation. Anamendment being crafted by House Armed Services CommitteeChairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) would add back an estimated $1billion elsewhere in the bill, including funds foranti-chemical weapons equipment, fast sealift capability, andhospital and ammunition supply ships.   Although the final margin last night was narrower and morepartisan than a comparable vote last year, the cut issignificantly deeper. The $2.3 billion level is less than theHouse approved as early as fiscal 1986, and represents anearly 40% cut from the $3.8 billion authorization for thecurrent fiscal year ending Sept. 30.   Critics argued that the reduced level condemns the programto research forever, and the Senate, which has approved $3.7billion for SDI next year, is certain to demand a higherfigure. In this context, the vote was directed at buying someleverage in the coming negotiations between the two chambers.But even if the House moves more than halfway toward theSenate, the final cut would be the deepest yet sustained bythe program.   The administration's own SDI budget was implicitlyrejected by a 338-83 margin. As much as conservatives citedthe threat of Iraqi arms, opponents countered that thePentagon had failed to give sufficient priority to therelatively small portion of the program devoted to developingsystems that intercept low-flying missiles such as the Scudused by Iraq.   Within SDI, an estimated $125 million is allocated thisyear for these so-called theater defense programs, and whilethe administration had requested $132 million for fiscal1991, it was a Senate Democratic initiative that proposed toraise the level to $180 million next year. Within thisfigure, an estimated $42 million would be provided by theSenate for the Arrow missile project with Israel, andRaytheon Co. has a stake in related work to further upgradeits Patriot missile, which has an anti-tactical missilecapability and is deployed with U.S. forces in the Mideast.   The House SDI provisions are neither as specific nor asambitious as the Senate proposal, but language inserted byRep. John Spratt (D., S.C.) cites the need for suchinterceptor missiles as one of the top priorities for arevamped program.   The debate on SDI came as the House moved toward finaladoption -- likely today -- of the underlying $283 billionauthorization bill for the Defense Department. Unlike theSenate, the measure would stop production of any additionalB-2 bombers beyond the 15 already authorized, but rather thanfight the issue on the House floor, Republican allies of theadministration chose to avoid any vote yesterday that mightinfluence negotiations during the conference between the twochambers.</TEXT></DOC>
