With the dollar continuing to weaken, the mark showed strength against both the pound and the yen. Overall, trading was muted before the partial holiday weekend in the U.S., Canada, and parts of Europe.    Limited intervention by the Bank of Japan in Tokyo trading, when the central bank bought dollars around the 123.85-yen level, and a higher level of rhetoric by the Japan government served to stabilize the dollar-yen exchange rate, which extended to other exchange rates.    During Tokyo trading, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters: &quot;The current currency situation requires coordinated intervention.&quot; He added that present currency movements, &quot;weren't good.&quot;    The statements appear to be the first public appeal by a central bank for concerted, coordinated action by the Group of Seven industrialized nations to halt the dollar's decline since the dollar began its descent in the beginning of October. (The G-7 is made up of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.)    In late trading the dollar was quoted at 1.7531 marks, down from 1.7637 marks late Wednesday in New York, and at 124.03 yen, down from 124.07 yen.    In Tokyo on Friday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 123.80 yen, down from Thursday's close of 124.10 yen.    A later report during New York trading indicating that the Bank of Japan would try to recruit European central banks in its efforts to curb the dollar's slide was interpreted as putting pressure specifically on the Bundesbank to help support the dollar. The Bundesbank has been noticeably absent from supporting the dollar during its recent decline.    Meanwhile, traders remain bearish on the dollar.    &quot;There is dissatisfaction with the {U.S.} deficits,&quot; said John McCarthy, chief dealer with Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank in New York. &quot;Pressure is being put on the new administration {of President-elect George Bush} to see what it can do about the deficits.&quot;    Traders said the market will continue to sell the dollar until there are credible plans from the coming administration or until there is a clear signal from G-7 central banks that the dollar has fallen far enough.    Given the fact the Bank of Japan has had to make a public appeal for help in curbing the dollar's decline, this clear signal seems to be unlikely in the near term, some dealers said.    Referring to the Bank of Japan's appeal, Phillip Eriksen, senior vice president with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco said: &quot;I believe it will be significant if it is ignored, and it will be ignored. The U.S. wants the dollar lower, and the Germans don't want to support the dollar.&quot;    With a lower dollar presenting &quot;easy medicine&quot; for the U.S.'s trade deficit ills, Mr. Eriksen said the coming administration would be more pleased to see the dollar fall before the January inauguration rather than later to avoid the political stigma of causing a weaker dollar.    Nevertheless, not everyone in the foreign exchange market views the dollar's decline as a foregone conclusion.    &quot;The dollar is grossly oversold at these levels,&quot; said Victor Polce, vice president of corporate foreign exchange with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. in New York. Mr. Polce said U.S. interest rates are moving higher and the September U.S. trade deficit, to be announced on Wednesday, will show a marked improvement over the August figures.    With these factors giving the dollar fundamental support, Mr. Polce said coordinated intervention by the G-7 central banks, as asked for by the Bank of Japan appeal, will be successful.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $4.10 to $419.00 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at $419.40 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
