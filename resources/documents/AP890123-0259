The air will be stored in a cavern measuring some 19 millioncubic feet, roughly one-third the space enclosed by Houston'sAstrodome.   When a generating plant to be built above the cavern startsworking in 1991, it will help meet peak power demands during theair-conditioning months of June through August, said John Howard ofAlabama Electric Cooperative.   The $50 million project offers a less expensive way to meetintermittent power demands than the conventional alternative,project officials say.   During periods of slack demand, the plant will compress air andpump it into the cavern, using electricity generated by otherplants. The air will be stored at up to about 1,100 pounds persquare inch, more than 30 times the pressure found in automobiletires.   To generate electricity later, the plant will withdraw compressedair, heat it and run it through its turbines.   In contrast, a conventional plant for meeting periodic peakscompresses air at the time it generates electricity, using naturalgas as fuel, said Peter Totten of Gibbs andamp; Hill Inc., a New York firmserving as architects and engineers for the Alabama project.   The Alabama approach will save money because using electricityfrom the other plants is less expensive than burning natural gas tocompress air, he said.   About a dozen American utilities are seriously looking atcompressed-air power plants, said Robert Schainker, manager of theenergy storage program at the Electric Power Research Institute inPalo Alto, Calif.   Such plants are ``very economically attractive'' for supplyingpower more than four or five hours a day but less than 12 hours aday, he said.   One project has been operating in West Germany since 1978, hesaid. Another is being built in the Soviet Union, and another isplanned in Israel, he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 26</NOTE></DOC>
