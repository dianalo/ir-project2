 That working group was formed in 1985.andP;  It has sinceproduced a draft international standard, which is currently being circulatedfor comments and voting.andP;  The committee hopes that at least the first twoparts of the standard will be approved by mid-1990.andP;  The third part, theshape information, is under development and may be approved by late next yearor early 1992.andM;Where did it come from?andM;In 1983, as an outgrowth of its work on networking, Xerox initiated an effortwith the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) School of Printing todevelop a means of interchanging font information from one system to another.andO;Xerox and RIT asked the leading font suppliers (Merganthaler, Monotype, URW,Compugraphic, Bitstream) to join them in an industry group that became knownas the Typographic Steering Committee.andP;  The committee spent the better partof a year just ironing out a standard vocabulary for describing fonttechnology that all of the vendors could agree on.andP;  Prior to this effort,every font foundry had its own vocabulary (as well as methods and software)for developing its fonts.andM;Once the vocabulary was established, the group decided to make a draft of astandard, vendor-independent format for interchanging font information.andP;  Inorder to make it official, the group presented its working draft to ANSI, theofficial standards body within the U.S.andP;  The draft was adopted as the basisfor a new ANSI work item and led to the creation of Task Group 10 (fontinterchange) within X3V1, which is the committee that works on documentprocessing.andP;  The plan was to take the ANSI standard and propose it to ISO foradoption on an international basis.andM;Instead, in 1985, the task group realized that an ISO effort to define a fontstandard had already been started in Europe.andP;  Realizing the need to reconcilethe two efforts, Ed Smura of Xerox, who chaired the Task Group, joined theISO effort and persuaded many of the font vendors to do the same so that thetask group's efforts could be brought to bear on the work the ISO committeehad begun.andM;The merging of the two groups and their efforts, as might be imagined, wasnot a smooth transition.andP;  The ANSI task group comprised font suppliers wellversed in the intricacies of typography but inexperienced in the politics ofinternational standards.andP;  The ISO group comprised representatives of computersuppliers who were well versed in standards but had little background intypography.andP;  One example of the wrenching changes that took place was thatmore than half of the vocabulary the original committee had ironed out had tobe changed because ISO does not like the same term (e.g., character) to beused in different ways by different standards.andM;In the time since, the project has been assigned to ISO/IEC Joint TechnicalCommittee 1/Subcommittee 18/Working Group 8, the group responsible for SGML,DSSSL and SPDL.andP;  The parent committee, SC 18, is also responsible for ODA,MOTIS and standards related to keyboards and icons.andM;Working Group 8 has moved 9541 past the Draft Proposal stage to the proposalof a Draft International Standard, which is being issued this month.andP;  Thisdraft will be circulated for ballot and comments for six months, after whichcomments are responded to and, if necessary, another draft is issued.andP;  If thedraft is accepted by 75 percent of the members voting, then it will besubmitted for approval as an International Standard.andM;What is it for?andM;The ISO font standard is a format for interchanging font information.andP;  Thereare two general types of information that might be interchanged.andP;  The firstis the font resource, which is the glyph shapes, metrics and other fontdescription information that make up the font data that actually resides onthe disk.andP;  The resource is the information that is transferred if you areactually interchanging font data.andP;  The second type of information is a fontreference, which is a specification of fonts used within a document.andP;  Thefont reference refers to the resource, which both sender and receiver musthave in order to make use of fonts in the document being passed between them.andO;But the reference is only a specification of the fonts used; through it userscan exchange information about fonts without actually interchanging fontdata.andP;  (An example of a reference would be to say the font used in thisdocument is 10-point Helvetica.andP;  Helvetica font data would not beinterchanged; it would be up to the receiving system to plug in the matchingfont or closest available substitute.)andM;Thus, the idea behind 9541 is that in lieu of a single working format allvendors can agree on, we'll use an interchange format that has been agreedupon by consensus.andP;  vendors who wish to support the standard will have toprovide tools for transferring information between their own format(s) andthat of the interchange standard, but by doing so they can protect theirprior investments and still offer users a means to interchange fontinformation among heterogeneous systems.andM;To use the language of the standard itself, the draft of 9541 &quot;specifies theinformation content of font resources--that information which can be used tobuild font references in general document interchange as well as theinformation format for font interchange amongst information processingsystems.&quot;andP;  In simpler terms, 9541 defines the model and possible contents offont resources and then uses the resouces to build references to fontinformation, such as would be used in a word processor or composition system.andM;Although, as we mentioned, 9541 may be used to transfer font data (as whenyou purchase fonts on disk), its most likely first use will be in referencingfonts within interchanged documents.andP;  Thus, 9541 is referenced by both ODAand DSSSL, the first two international standards for revisable compounddocument interchange that deal with formatting information (including fonts).andO;An overview of ODA and a brief summary of DSSSL are featured in the Decemberissue of the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems.andM;Three parts.andP;  The ISO font standard has three parts.andP;  The first two describethe content of a font reference and the syntax for sending such content.andO;This lays the groundwork for including font information in documents beinginterchanged among different systems.andP;  To put it into a practical context,these parts cover what would be in an Adobe AFM file.andP;  The third part definesthe shape representations, which could be used to build a complete fontresource (including scaling hints), as when buying fonts for your system, forexample.andP;  This would correspond to what Adobe supplies in its Type 1 files.andM;To summarize the three parts:andM;* Part 1 specifies the font resource architecture, the overall framework fornaming font resources, describing overall font characterlistics andreferences to font resources within a document.andM;* Part 2 specifies the font resource interchange format.andP;  This is the actualsyntax used to send the information as part of a data stream.andM;* Part 3 will specify the glyph shape representation architecture andinterchange formats.andM;The standard looks beyond English to cover every kind of typesetting in theworld.andP;  This encompasses all text processing systems, from word processors tocommercial composition systems.andP;  ISO has commissioned a nonprofitorganization, the Association for Font Information Interchange (AFII), tocompile a list of all of the glyphs (or character shapes) in common usethroughout the world and to give each a unique number identifier.andP;  The listcontains all languages in common use, including Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese,Hindi, Japanese and Eastern European as well as languages that use the Latinalphabet.andP;  Once this list is compiled, the third part of the standard willdefine how those shapes are represented in a way that all vendors of fonts ortext processing systems may make use of.andM;All fonts are described in device- and resolution-independent fashion.andP;  Thestandard assumes that hardware or presentation medium limitations should bedetermined at the time of imaging, and that no such limitations will be inthe fonts themselves.andM;Glyphs vs.andP;  characters.andP;  It is important to note that the font standardseparates the identification of the glyph (that is, the shape which is mappedto a unique glyph ID) from the semantics, or meaning, of the character it ismapped to.andP;  The font standard provides the means of identifying all uniqueglyphs.andP;  (The registration of the glyphs is being done by AFII.)andP;  But thisstandard does not deal with character sets, which are already defined inother ISO standards.andP;  Nor does it say how glyphs will be mapped to charactersets.andP;  That will be done by standards such as DSSSL.andM;The ISO font standard is concerned only with the unique identification ofglyphs within a font resource, which pertains to the fonts themselves, nottheir meaning in a document.andP;  This makes it possible to have multiple shapesper character and vice versa.andM;Although there is usually a one-to-one correspondence between shapes andcharacters, there are enough exceptions to make this distinction useful.andP;  Forexample, in Arabic, the shape of a character may change depending on itscontext.andP;  A reverse example is the ASCII hyphen-minus, which is usuallyrepresented by one shape but may be mapped to several character codes.andP;  Athird example is the case of glyphs supplied with a font without theircharacter encodings (i.e., shapes that are not mapped).andM;The separation of the font shapes from their meanings provides a way ofstandardizing each without trying to create a format that would premap shapesto character content.andP;  There is some debate within the font and standardscommunities as to whether or not this separation is acceptable for alllanguages.andP;  The font committee decided that, from an abstract point of view,this method was the most practical.andP;  It enabled the committee to focus onfonts, leaving the standardization of character sets to other existing ISOcommittees and industry efforts (see box, below).andM;Part 1: The resource architectureandM;The architecture covers the overall framework of font resources andreferences.andP;  To reiterate, a font resource is a collection glyphs, togetherwith descriptive information and font metrics that are relevant to the glyphcollection as a whole.andP;  (A glyph collection, sometimes referred to as a glyphrepertoire, is usually a font, which may or may not correspond to a characterset.)andP;  A font reference is a description of font information in a documentthat points to a font resource.andM;In other words, when the font standard is used in document interchange, thefonts themselves are not transferred.andP;  Instsead, the transferred documentcontains a font reference, which indicates which fonts were used (ordesired), the metrics and other descriptive information so that the receivingsystem can either plug in the same fonts or substitute the closest fontsavailable.andM;The degree of precision with which fonts are specified in a reference isvariable, from very vague (use a serif face) to very precise (use Linotype'sFrutiger 141 in 11-point x-height).andP;  The more precise the reference, the morerestrictions the receiving system has when plugging in a compatible font.andM;Properties.andP;  The standard describes fonts by means of properties.andP;  It makesuse of three types of font properties--general, modal and glyph shaperepresentation.andP;  The latter type will be defined in part 3 of the standard.andO;The general and modal properties cover most of the descriptive information,including the writing mode (directin) and metrics (width tables) of eachglyph in the font.andM;The following is a list of the different properties the standard provides.andO;They are listed in the order in which they appear in the standard.andM;The font name is the device-independent name of the font resource, asassigned by the data source.andP;  In conjunction with AFII, the RochesterInstitute of Technology is currently compiling a list of all originaltypefaces from all of the world's leading font foundries.andP;  This list will beused internatinoally to identify font resources in a device-independentfashion, so that two applications that make use of the smae fonts--whetherthey be from Linotype, Monotype, Bitstream or whomever--will specify the fontname in exactly the same way, that is, by its ISO number.andP;  The manufacturerof the font will be a prefix to another identifying number.andP;  This will helpdifferentiate, for example, the Times roman of Linotype from the similarfaces from other vendors.andM;The font description is a list of global properties.andP;  In all, there are 21possible properties.andP;  They include the structured name of the supplier; amessage about the copyright information, which names the legal owner of thedigital font data; the design source, the structured name of the typefacedesign; a message on the copyright of the name; the relative rational units,which usually denotes the denominator of those font metrics expressed as aratio of the body size; a message, designed for reading by the user, aboutthe typeface used (usually its name, weight, posture, etc.); the font family;the posture (upright, oblique, back slanted, italic, back slanted italic orotherwise); posture angle; weight; width (amount condensed or expanded); anordered property list of the glyph properties (number of glyphs, referencesto collections); design size; capital height; lower-case height; designgroup; structure (solid, outline, etc.); minimum feature size; nominalcapital stem width; nominal lower-case stem width; and nominal writing mode(the one used if no other is specified in the document).andM;Writing modes.andP;  Part of the descriptive information about a font is itswriting mode.andP;  Writing modes indicate in which direction characters are drawnrelative to a Cartesian coordinate system (an x/y graph, where the origin is0/0).andP;  Examples are left-to-right, top-to-bottom and right-to-left.andP;  It isthis property that allows documents containing mixed languages to beinterchanged.andP;  Subproperties are extensive, covering such items as ligatures,scores (under-, over-, through-and strikeout), anamorphic scaling, pairwiseadjustments (for pair kerning) and other items needed to describe the glyphs.andM;For font suppliers, the important aspect of writing modes is the ability touse the same shapes in multiple writing modes.andP;  The foundry supplies acollection of glyphs that may be mapped to any number of character sets.andP;  ISO9541 also provides a model for developing a computer-based writing systemthat would support multiple writing modes.andP;  This is part of what Xerox did indeveloping multilingual support for the Star (now ViewPoint) editor.andP;  Today,most desktop word processing and page composition programs support only onewriting mode.andP;  The ISO font standard provides a model that might be usefulfor application developes interested in developing multilingual editors (seeillustration).andM;Metrics.andP;  The glyph, or font, metrics are a set of properties that arecommonly known as width tables.andP;  They describe the escapement values of eachglyph as specified by the font supplier.andP;  This section includesspecifications for using sectored as well as paired kerning and tracking ofescapement values based on different font sizes.andM;This part of the standard is fairly straightforward.andP;  For every font, thereis an associated table of widths for the glyphs contained within the font.andO;The ISO font standard sets forth a standard way of describing the widths, sothat all font suppliers can provide their width tables in a consistent mannerthat will make life for developers much easier and will facilitate consistentformatting of documents across different systems.andM;Part 2: Interchange formatsandM;The second part of the standard describes the formats of the data streamsused to transfer font information about a document.andP;  There will be two suchrepresentations.andP;  The first is ASN.1, a binary encoding that is used fortransferring documents on OSI networks.andP;  ASN.1 is used by ODA and X.400, aswell as other ISO standards.andP;  The second syntax will be SGML.andP;  This is aclear-text representation meant for processing by SGML applications and textprocessing systems.andM;The two representations are functionally equivalent.andP;  We hope that vendorswill implement font servers that will be able to read both format, shieldingthe font format from the user, and there is already work within ISO to definea protocol for such products.andM;One advantage of using ASN.1 and SGML for interchange is that parsers arereadily available for interpreting both formats.andP;  Thus, applicationdevelopers can plug in third-party parsers as starting points for buildingsupport for 9541.andP;  In SGML, there is the additional advantage that a fontresource can be treated as a document in its own right--as when publishing afont catalog, for example.andM;Part 3: Glyph shape representationsandM;The thorny issue in the font standard is the way that the underlying fontshape data is represented.andP;  At present, all suppliers have their own formats;most also supply fonts in at least one other format--Adobe's--and somesupport others, such as Folio.andP;  All of the major suppliers have committed tosupplying fonts in Apple's Royal font format, although none have said whenthat will happen.andM;The ISO font standard committee is leaning toward supporting at least twofont technologies--outline and bitmap--but it has yet to decide whichindustry format to use as the basis for either.andP;  Many of the font foundriesare on the committee, which puts them in a position to lobby for the adoptionof their technology.andP;  The most notable absentees are Apple and Sun.andP;  Apple isinvolved with AFII but has yet to join the ISO working group; Sun has notjoined either group.andM;Whatever format is decided upon (and it is likely that the ISO one will be asuperset of one vendor's model), the ISO font format will still support theinterchange of private formats.andP;  All of the information regarding the fontsand glyphs may be transferred with or without the translation key.andP;  If thereceiving system has the key, it can use the same fonts.andP;  If not, thedeveloper could include a mechanism for substituting fonts using the fontlibrary the user has available.andM;Thus, if Adobe Type 1 format is selected as the ISO standard, for example,you'll still be able to send Royal fonts to another system that uses Royalfonts.andP;  Even if your private font format is not resident on the receivingsystem, if the font information is sent using parts one and two of thestandard, the receiving system can substitute fonts using the widthssupplied.andM;The point of ISO 9541 is interchange.andP;  Even if your fonts are different fromthose of the prson you send a document to, if you send all of the fontresource information, they should be able to (assuming they have software thtenables them to) interpret the document and substitute appropriate fonts.andM;Support for the standardandM;System suppliers.andP;  At the outset, the driving force behind this standard wasXerox, which had done considerable research into multilingual processing anddocument interchange and, by the start of the 1980s, decided to pursue itstechnology in a way that would be compatible with other systems.andP;  Xerox wassoon joined by IBM and DEC, between them the driving forces in thelarge-systsem office automation world.andP;  Recently, Hewlett-Packard has offeredits support as well.andM;The computer supplirs continue to be the driving force behind the standard.andO;These companies are the ones that install large global networks forcorporations that have multiple sites around the world.andP;  Such customers areamong the first to deal with heterogeneous systems and thus are most likelyto be the first beneficiaries of vendor-independent interchange standards.andM;From the point of view of a system supplier, part of the task of buildingopen systems in the 1990s will be the ability to cope with multiple fontformats and multiple glyph collections within a single operating environment.andO;Some suppliers see the ISO font standard as a key component of &quot;fontservers,&quot; which will shiled the task of font translation from the user.andO;Their intent is to make it possible to ask for a font from a given list (thefont you want may or may not be resident on your local machine) and have thesystem make any translations for you as the fonts are supplied to yourcomputer's display.andP;  The server would play a similar role when exchangingdocuments across open networks.andM;Font foundries.andP;  All major font foundries of the early 1980s (Linotype,Monotype, URW, Compugraphic, Bitstream) were early supporters of the standardand instrumental in defining its terminology.andP;  Adobe, which entered later buthas emerged as a major font supplier, is actively involved in both thisstandard and the Standard Page Description Language (SPDL, something we'lldiscuss in a future article).andP;  Recently, however, the support from the fontvendors has waned.andP;  According to several sources, Monotype is the only otherfont supplier that continues to send a representative to committee meetingson a regular basis.andP;  Compugraphic, URW and Linotype stopped going some timeago; Bitstream is the most recent drop-out.andP;  Sun Microsystems, which acquiredFolio earlier this year, and Apple, which announced its Royal format onlylast year, have yet to participate at all.andM;In random interviews for this article, there was little consensus from thefont suppliers as to the impact of ISO 9541.andP;  Clearly, the laborious processof hashing out a standard by consensus has frustrated representatives of fontsuppliers, since they also have other jobs to do.andP;  (The computer suppliersare large enough that they have appointed people whose primary role isworking on standards.)andP;  Adobe is currently very active in developing the SPDLand indicated that conforming to ISO 9541 should not be difficult, if marketdemand warranted such support.andP;  Other suppliers indicated that they wouldprobably follow Adobe's lead, since they use Adobe tools to make theirPostScript fonts.andM;Application developers.andP;  It's still too early to really expect applicationdevelopers to make use of the ISO font standard.andP;  (It is, after all, still adraft.)andP;  But we see potential among software developers interested inmultilingual document processing and composition.andP;  The ISO font standardprovides a reference model for writing modes and describes a way for fontinformation in a multilingual document to be referenced by an application.andO;If nothing else, ISO 9541 should at leasat raise the issue of multilingualprocessing for software developers who wrestle with multiple font formats.andO;How easy it will be to develop products that make use of the standard is adifferent matter, one that we'll have to wait a year to address.andM;The upshot.andP;  The case may be made that the font technology the committeeselects will become the one most widely used in the computer industry atlarge by the end of the 1990s.andP;  This is pure conjecture, and there really isno way to predict how the market will evolve.andP;  But no matter which format isselected for the representation of the glyphs, the font standard's realimpact will be in furthering the cause of document interchange.andP;  Asheterogeneous systems become more prevalent in the 1990s, the ISO fontstandard will lay the foundation for future standards that deal with theactual content and formatting of documents.andP;  In so doing, its intent is tomake the dream of system-independent document interchange a reality.andM;If you have opinions about this subject, or are interested in finding outmore, now is the right time to give the committee your input.andP;
