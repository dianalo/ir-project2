Negotiations to form what would be Italy's 49th postwargovernment are expected to take weeks. President Francesco Cossigaasked De Mita, a Christian Democrat, to stay on as caretaker.   After giving Cossiga his resignation, De Mita told reporters theSocialists left him no alternative to resigning.   Bush is to arrive May 26 on the first stop of a European tour.Former President Ronald Reagan faced a similar situation in June1987, arriving in Italy after Premier Bettino Craxi resigned.   Craxi, who leads the Socialist Party, is De Mita's main foe andprompted the resignation by challenging the five-party coalition'sviability.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Dillen, said ``it is too early tosay'' whether there will be a change in Bush's plans, which includemeetings with De Mita and Pope John Paul II.   Bush's nominee for ambassador to Italy, Michigan businessmanPeter Secchia, also has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.   Maxwell Rabb, who served eight years, held a farewell partyearlier this week and planned to fly home on Saturday, but reportsare that he will stay for the Bush visit.   De Mita has led the government for 13 months and the Socialistshave accused him for weeks of not showing leadership.   In a closing speech Friday at the Socialist convention in Milan,Craxi demanded a ``political and procedural clarification'' and anurgent Cabinet meeting. De Mita resigned immediately after thatmeeting.   Besides the Christian Democrats and Socialists, his coalitionincludes the small Republican, Social Democrat and Liberal parties.   Craxi leads Italy's third-largest party, after the ChristianDemocrats and Communists, and is trying to regain the premiership.   He and other Socialist leaders have accused De Mita of failingto implement the coalition's agenda of political and economicreform, including reduction of a deficit projected at $90 billionfor this year.</TEXT></DOC>
