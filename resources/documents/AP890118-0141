SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When President Reagan donned white tie andtails last week to attend a fancy dinner in New York City, heconfided to aides he'd had the elegantly styled suit made 40 yearsago, for the 1948 Academy Awards.   ``It's hard to believe, but it's true,'' said presidentialspokesman Marlin Fitzwater, a man who is well-acquainted with thebattle of the bulge. ``I don't think he's even had it altered.''   Ronald Reagan, who leaves office Friday, bore the burdens of thepresidency for two terms and even weathered a harrowingassassination attempt in 1981 not to mention a 1985 bout with coloncancer and a few other surgeries.   Yet, except for a few more wrinkles _ and some gray hair _ he'sretained a physique that defies the image of a 77-year-oldgrandfather.   Those close to him _ including first lady Nancy Reagan _ say it'sall due to a remarkable discipline, begun as a teen-age lifeguardand honed as an actor, attentive to diet and physical fitness.   ``He's in amazing health,'' said Dr. Larry Mohr, one of thepresident's White House physicians. ``It has to do with genes, butalso with his attitude. He's just always on an even keel.''   Reagan has never been shy about the fact that he's religiouslyfollowed a 9-to-5 office schedule, allowing plenty of time for restand relaxation. Over his eight-year presidency, Reagan has spentsome 457 days in California, mostly on vacation at his ranch nearSanta Barbara or in his old home town of Los Angeles.   Aides point out that Reagan's sense of humor, and an ability toavoid taking himself too seriously, may have helped keep him inshape.   Pictures of Reagan, dubbed ``Rawhide'' by the Secret Service,adorn many White House walls. One favorite shows the president injeans, workshirt and protective goggles, with chainsaw in hand andbiceps bulging, as he mows down wizened scrub oak trees on hisCalifornia ranch.   The president chats often with his aides about his diet and howhe keeps healthy, Fitzwater said.   He is so conscientious about using his body-building equipment ona daily basis that he had it hauled to Moscow last year for thethree-day summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``Heworked out every night, after the meetings and before dinner,''Fitzwater said.   ``I peel down and go into the gym,'' Reagan said in a recentinterview with CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' adding that he uses ``atreadmill and various Nautilus weight equipment.''   Mrs. Reagan, in the same interview, said she's had to temperReagan's enthusiasm for the exercises _ suggested by his physiciansas a way to get back in shape after the 1981 shooting and chestsurgery _ because the president was adding so much muscle he wasthreatening to outgrow his suits.   ``I kept saying, `Stop. Don't increase any more. This is gettingtoo expensive!'' Mrs. Reagan said with a laugh.   Reagan keeps a constant watch on his weight _ hovering at 189 to190 pounds with a 34-inch waistline _ by comparing himself weeklywith his personal physician, Dr. John Hutton, who also tries to holdto the weight level.   ``Every Tuesday we have a weigh-off,'' said Hutton recently. ``Ifwe're a pound or two over, we see who can get it off first.''   Mrs. Reagan, who says she also tries to follow a daily exerciseroutine, recalls that at one time in college she weighed 145 pounds,but now weighs only 105 or 106 pounds.   At a recent luncheon, the first lady pooh-poohed reports that shewas anorexic, contending that the worries over her husband'sshooting, as well as her parents' deaths, had caused her to dropsome pounds while in the White House. With a big smile, Mrs. Reaganeagerly scooped up a dessert of bread pudding.   But the first lady made clear that the president's eating andexercise habits are his alone. ``It's his own thing,'' Mrs. Reagansaid in the interview. ``I just think you have to have awell-balanced, sensible diet. I'm not one for extremes.''   Fitzwater, who has struggled with diets and poked fun at his ownstocky frame, shakes his head in wonderment at the president'sability to be ``a very disciplined eater.''   ``His whole life is very disciplined. ... He just doesn't lethimself go. He drinks a glass of wine at lunch for a state officialor a visiting dignitary. I don't think I've ever seen him take ahard drink,'' Fitzwater said.   The spokesman added that he's watched in wonder as Reagan willconsume a green salad or Jell-O, even if others at the same tableare chowing down on a beef Wellington _ which happens to be hisfavorite.</TEXT></DOC>
