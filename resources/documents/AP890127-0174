The Foreign Ministry said it was told the 5-foot-deep,14-foot-wide ditch was to solve drainage problems on Otay Mesa,along the border, not to control migration.   U.S. Associate Attorney General Francis A. Keating II said themain purpose of the ditch is to discourage drug smugglers fromdriving across the border. The area also is one of the most popularcrossing points for illegal immigrants entering the United States.   The project's engineering and drainage aspects are not whatbothers Mexico, the government newspaper El Nacional said Friday.   ``What causes uneasiness in Mexico is what it symbolizes: theaftertaste of a certain spirit of lack of understanding andintolerance, as a material obstacle to make the entrance moredifficult ... for men and women who in the end are only searchingfor work in a foreign land and frequently suffer bad treatment andeven aggression as a result of the atmosphere of hostility,'' itsaid.   The newspaper Excelsior said: ``The idea of digging a ditch in acertain part of the border between Mexico and the United States canonly be described as unacceptable and worrisome since it signals anew wave of unilateral measures to deal with the problem ofundocumented Mexicans going to the United States.''   El Universal, another major independent newspaper, noted thatPresident Bush just a few days ago talked of the importance ofimproving relations with U.S. neighbors.   ``These affirmations contrast with negative and unfriendlyattitudes, such as that hostile project, which certainly has nothingto contribute to resolving problems and in contrast will increasethe differences,'' El Universal said.   In Tijuana, Roberto L. Martinez, president of the local Pro-Lawand Justice Coalition said the ditch was a waste of money.   ``What is needed is to pay attention to the social problems thatprovoke the migratory movement and create well-paid jobs that allowthose people to stay in their places of origin,'' he said.   ``No physical obstacle will be able to stop the migratory flow tothe United States,'' said Ofelia Woo of the Colegio de la FronteraNorte, a Tijuana think tank. ``The social problem that migrationrepresents needs a bilateral solution from Mexico and the UnitedStates.''   Guadalupe Gomez Maganda, president of the foreign relationscommission of the Chamber of Deputies and a member of the governingInstitutional Revolutionary Party, also attacked the plan.   ``The U.S. government project constitutes an unfriendly and to acertain degree hostile attitude that restricts the possibilities forresolving together the problems of neighboring communities,'' thecongresswoman said.   ``From the point of view of international relations, you canconsider it offensive,'' said Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, leader ofthe leftist National Democratic Front.</TEXT></DOC>
