The conflict, which is costing $10 billion a year, has forcedPresident Saddam Hussein to streamline a bloated prewarbureaucracy, increase efficiency in government sectors and scrapsome of his socialist programs.   Oil prices are firmer and oil exports are climbing. Saddam hassold off inefficient state-owned enterprises in a program aimed atrevitalizing the private sector, long suppressed by socialistpolicies.   All this has helped ease the worries of Iraq's many creditors,who last year had to reschedule the country's debt repaymentsbecause the Iraqis did not have enough cash.   Even so, Iraq is only just managing to keep pace with awar-incurred foreign debt of at least $35 billion, diplomats say.   The government's decision last year to loosen its grip onsubsidized prices and foreign exchange has helped reduceonce-chronic shortages but at a painful cost for many of Iraq's 15million people.   The long lines of shoppers outside stores are fewer now than in1986 because goods are more plentiful.   Some Iraqis grumble about prices, however.   Local meat, which used to cost the equivalent of $7.50 to $9 apound, now sells for $9 to $10.50 a pound, at the dollar's officialrate of exchange against the dinar of $3.30 to one. Exchange housesoutside Iraq, however, trade the dinar at 50 cents for one.   Bread, rice and cooking oil remain subsidized. But a package of30 eggs that once cost $4.30, now sells for at least $8.30.   Even the cost of candy bars has risen, from 25 cents to nearly$1.   These are stiff prices for many workers. Civil servants, forexample, earn 90 to 150 dinars a month.   Many Iraqis have found their incomes squeezed further this yearby increased working hours in essential industries and offices,making the once-common practice of moonlighting nearly impossible.   It's still difficult to find many goods at subsidized prices,forcing Iraqis into the costly black market for such things as carparts or cigarettes.   The variety on the vegetable stands is the most visible sign ofIraq's move away from 20 years of strict socialist controls on theeconomy.   The government told businessmen last year they could importgoods with foreign currency, with few questions asked about howthey got the money.   Planning Minister Samal Majeed Faraj said recently Iraq willallow Arabs from other countries to invest in Iraq with guaranteesagainst government seizure of their assets.   In the last year, the government has sold off bus companies,poultry farms, dairies, gas stations and supermarkets and otherbusinesses and is trying to get outside investors to buy a stake inIraqi Airways, the national flag carrier.   Saddam also abolished labor laws that had guaranteed employment.   Other countries are looking at Iraq with more confidence.   It has won promises of new loans or credit guarantees from theUnited States, France and West Germany.   ``Until the war, it didn't matter if the economy was well run ornot because they had so much money,'' said a European diplomat.   ``This is a country with more than 100 billion barrels of provenoil reserves,'' the diplomat noted. ``They plainly have a way torepay.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, May 17</NOTE></DOC>
