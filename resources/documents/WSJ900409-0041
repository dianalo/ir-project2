At Dec. 31, the total amount of junk bonds held by savingsand loan associations fell to $10.59 billion, or $2.93billion less than the $13.52 billion held at Sept. 30,according to government data collected by SheshunoffInformation Services, an Austin, Texas,financial-institutions research firm. The reduction reflectsoutright sales of junk as well as write-downs to reflecttheir deteriorating market value over the last severalmonths. Such write-downs are in effect required as part ofthe thrift bailout law that Congress passed last August.Under the law, thrifts must also divest their entire holdingsby the end of 1994.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, the reduction is proving increasingly painfuland costly. Of the 198 thrifts holding junk bonds at yearend, 36 have failed, including seven of the top 15, accordingto the Sheshunoff report. Several other junk-bond-holdingthrifts are considered in imminent danger of a federalseizure, including Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association ofBeverly Hills, Calif., the largest Sandamp;L holder of junk bondswith $3.69 billion at year end. Columbia said last week thatjunk-bond losses through February had left it insolvent.   As a result of federal takeovers of troubled institutions,the federal Resolution Trust Corp. is now one of the nation'sbiggest holders of junk bonds, with roughly $3.6 billion, orenough to rival top-rated Columbia, according to theSheshunoff data. Lately, the government has been assembling ajunk-bond team to sell the portfolio, although it says it hasno plans to dump the junk quickly.   Junk-bond losses are also rapidly adding to the estimatedgovernment tab for resolving the Sandamp;L crisis. On Friday, theCongressional Budget Office revised to $325 billion from $257billion its estimate of cleaning up the mess over a 30-yearperiod. Other analysts suggest that amount of loss will occurin the next decade alone. Junk bonds are also accounting fora growing share of the industry's on-going operating losses,according to Kenneth Thomas, a Miami thrift consultant. Mr.Thomas estimated that junk-bond losses alone accounted forabout 17%, or $1.2 billion, of the Sandamp;L industry's $6.5billion aggregate net losses in the fourth quarter. He alsosaid losses could increase because many thrifts have beenselling only their &quot;best&quot; junk bonds lately and holding ontotheir most troubled issues.   &quot;I am sure the regulators rue the day they ever permittedSandamp;Ls to buy junk bonds,&quot; said Allan Bortel, a San Franciscothrift analyst and consultant.   The issue is a bitter pill for some managers of junk-ladenthrifts to swallow, and it is also creating some ratherstrange anomalies. Many such executives believe therequirement to write down their holdings to market prices isarbitrary and unfair because other thrifts and banks aren'tgenerally required to carry their assets at market. They saidthe write-down and sales requirements are further depressingan already weak market for such bonds.   &quot;When you make decisions based on holding assets tomaturity and then the rules change in the middle of theballgame, it is very difficult to be able to react,&quot; said aspokesman for Mississippi Savings Bank, of Batesville, Miss.About 17% of the thrift's $185 million in assets are junkbonds. Recent write-downs left it in violation of minimumfederal capital standards. &quot;We are not optimistic,&quot; thespokesman added.   Government regulators may also have exacerbated thedilemma by allowing new private owners of once-failed thriftsto continue buying junk bonds. Such institutions as AmericanSavings Bank, of Stockton, Calif., and Far West Federal Bank,of Portland, Ore., built up significant junk-bond portfoliosfollowing government-arranged private takeovers. AmericanSavings, which had about $493.6 million in junk bonds atyear-end, couldn't be reached for comment.   Officials of Far West Federal said its roughly $130million portfolio was closely regulated, that its write-downshave approximated only about 5% of the total portfoliothrough March 31, and that it has suffered no actual defaultson any of its holdings. &quot;It is not a junky junk portfolio,&quot;asserted David Nierenberg, Far West's chairman. The thrifthas nonetheless sued the federal government in Portlandfederal court, alleging that it improperly backed out of arescue plan aimed at allowing Far West to rebuild its capitalthrough a series of complicated financial transactions knownas risk-controlled-arbitrage.   By contrast, United Savings Assocation of Texas, hasreduced its junk-bond portfolio to about $129 millioncurrently from more than $500 million at the time the thriftwas taken over in late 1988 by a group including formerSalomon Brothers Inc. executive Lewis Ranieri, a spokesmanfor that thrift said.   But actual losses have been increasing, also. In a filinglast week with the federal Office of Thrift Supervision,Columbia Savings, for example, said its non-accural junkbonds had grown an additional $431.4 million just since Dec.31, or 80% more than the $521.6 million in troubled junk itreported at year-end. Columbia is basing its survival plan ontrying to sell its entire portfolio in a single transaction,possibly as soon as the third quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
