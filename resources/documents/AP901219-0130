A Palestinian strike, which would close all of Bethlehem'stourist shops and restaurants on Dec. 24, ``will make for a gloomy,gloomy Christmas,'' admitted Tourism Ministry spokesman YossiShoval.   But, he added, ``There will be no change in our Christmasevents, with or without their support.''   The main government-sponsored event on Christmas Eve is anevening choir performance in Bethlehem, which is in the occupiedWest Bank. Religious activitis include a procession into theChurch of the Nativity led by the Roman Catholic patriarch ofJerusalem, a Protestant prayer service in nearby Shepherd's Fieldand midnight Mass.   The Israeli army posts hundreds of troops in Bethlehem atChristmas to man roadblocks and metal detectors that visitors mustpass through to reach the church, where Christian tradition saysChrist was born.   It is the fourth consecutive year that the undergroundPalestinian leadership has called a strike in Bethlehem tounderscore the uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bankand Gaza Strip.   The leaflet calling the strike said it was also ``due to thegulf crisis.'' Many Palestinians support Iraqi President SaddamHussein.   Earlier, Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said the municipality wouldcancel traditional Christmas parades and receptions again this yearin solidarity with the uprising.   Bishop Samir Kafity, the Anglican bishop of Jerusalem, told ameeting of visiting American Christian leaders on Wednesday heunderstood the frustration of his fellow Palestinians.   ``How can we celebrate the birth of the prince of peace if wehave no sign of this peace coming?'' he said.   He predicted ``more soldiers than worshipers'' in Bethlehem atChristmas.   Shoval said the Tourism Ministry expects about 7,000 people tovisit Bethlehem this holiday season, one-third fewer than last yearand down sharply from before the uprising began.   ``Considering the gulf crisis, it's an okay number,'' he said.   Several American, Hungarian and German church choirs that wereexpected to perform on Christmas Eve in Bethlehem have canceledtheir trips, apparently out of concern about the gulf crisis, otherministry officials said.   The only two currently scheduled to perform are the chancelchoir of the First United Methodist Church of Oklahoma City andJerusalem's Living Stones Community Choir.</TEXT></DOC>
