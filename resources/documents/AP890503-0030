Rehnquist urgedCongress today to give the nation's federal judges an immediate 30percent pay raise.   Calling inadequate salaries ``the most serious threat to thefuture of the judiciary,'' Rehnquist sought support for legislationproviding the raise and regular cost-of-living adjustments.   ``This is not, in my view, fairly termed a pay raise,''Rehnquist said in a prepared statement to the House Post Office andCivil Service Committee. ``This is instead a partial recapture ofthe tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affectedjudicial salaries over the last 20 years.''   A 30 percent pay increase would boost the chief justice's annualsalary from $115,000 to $149,500. Salaries of Supreme Courtjustices would rise from $110,000 to $143,000; appeals court judgesfrom $95,000 to $123,500; and trial judges from $89,500 to $116,500.   There are about 700 active federal judges. About 300 others areon senior status, meaning they do as much or as little work as theywish. All receive the same raises.   As chief justice, Rehnquist is a member of the Supreme Court,heads the federal judiciary and chairs the policy-making U.S.Judicial Conference.   He said the Judicial Conference recognizes there was``widespread public opposition'' to a defeated proposal for a 51percent pay raise for senior government officials, includingmembers of Congress and federal judges.   ``We believe, however, that a smaller increase of 30 percent forfederal judges is both publicly acceptable and fully justified,''Rehnquist said.   The chief justice also emphasized the importance of routinecost-of-living adjustments in judicial salaries, which he said``could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable `catch-up'increases'' being proposed.   Currently, federal judges receive the periodic raises given tomost federal employees by Congress.   ``Congress' historical reluctance to increase its own pay levelshas often meant that cost-of-living increases for other seniorgovernment officials have also been denied,'' Rehnquist said.   Under the legislation backed by the Judicial Conference,cost-of-living raises for judges would not be tied to similarraises for Congress.   Despite Rehnquist's complaint about infrequent cost-of-livingincreases, federal judges have received them in most years since1975. During that period, district court salaries have risen from$42,000 to $89,500 and appellate court salaries from $44,600 to$95,000.   Last week, five Democratic and Republican members of the Housecourts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that publicprotests would likely block any judicial pay raise unlessnon-working seniors judges were excluded. The judges opposed suchlimits.   The Associated Press earlier this year reported previouslyunpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent ofthe then-306 senior judges did no judicial work, including formerChief Justice Warren Burger.   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and Rep. Carlos Moorhead,R-Calif., chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee,subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other thancost-of-living increases from senior judges who carry less than 25percent of an active judge's caseload.   But they also agreed, at the judges' request, to submit a billcalling for the general 30 percent raise and annual cost-of-livingincreases.   President Bush has proposed a 25 percent increase along with aban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income. Thejudges oppose both the ban and the limit.</TEXT></DOC>
