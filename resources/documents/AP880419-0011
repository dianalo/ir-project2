(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 28-room mansion built as a weddinggift has gained a reputation of bringing bad luck to those who livethere: Three of its residents have faced criminal charges, two havelost their fortunes and one killed himself.   The latest owners of Dunnellen Hall are real estate tycoonsHarry and Leona Helmsley, who were indicted last week on New Yorkstate and federal tax charges.   ``It wasn't the happiest home,'' said Marjorie Rowe, presidentof Preferred Properties Inc., who handled two of the sales of themansion. ``It seems as if some very wealthy people who lived therelost their fortunes. If the walls could talk ...''   The house sits on 26 acres in Greenwich, hometown to suchnotables as Donald Trump and Diana Ross. The average price of ahome here is about $1 million, real estate agents say.   It was built in 1918 at a cost of $1 million for Daniel GreyReid, president of the American Tin Plate Co., as a wedding giftfor his daughter, Rhea. She married Henry J. Topping, son of JohnA. Topping, president of Republic Steel.   The estate, referred to locally as the ``Topping House,'' wasnamed Dunnellen Hall by Rhea Reid Topping for her mother, Ella Dunn.   It was sold for the first time in 1950 to Loring Washburn,president of S.H. Pormeroy andamp; Co., a steel fabricating company. Buthe suffered financial troubles and lost the house in 1963.   Others who have had trouble after they moved into the house were:   _Daniel Moran, a former New York City policeman who was marriedto Gregg Sherwood Dodge, a heiress to the Dodge automobile fortune.Moran shot and killed a busboy who apparently was trying to climbinto the bedroom window of their Florida home in 1968. The slayingwas ruled justifiable homicide.   Moran killed himself in 1977, although a judge would not saywhether the shooting was intentional or accidental.   _Investor Jack Dick. He was indicted by a New York City grandjury on 46 counts of grand larceny and forgery for allegedlystealing $840,000 through the use of false documents to obtain aloan.   He pleaded innocent in 1971. The case was pending when he diedsuddenly in 1974 at the age of 46 while being driven to the estateby his chauffeur.   _Ravi Tikkoo, owner of the one of the world's largest oilsupertankers. He lost the bulk of his fortune during the OPEC oilembargo and petroleum shortages in the mid-1970s.   The Helmsleys, one of the world's wealthiest couples at anestimated $1.4 billion and with a stake in the Empire StateBuilding, bought the estate in 1983 for $11 million.   The Helmsleys pleaded innocent last week to charges in a188-count New York state tax evasion indictment. They are accusedby New York officials of avoiding taxes by claiming about $4million in renovations to Dunnellen Hall as business expenses attheir hotels.   The couple also face a 47-count federal indictment on similarcharges.   Phyllis Parizek, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department ofRevenue Services, said Monday that two auditors had been assignedto examine the Helmsleys' finances.   Last week, Timothy F. Bannon, state commisioner of revenueservices, said his investigators were taking a close look at theNew York charges to determine if any Connecticut taxes were owed onitems at the estate.   One of the Helmsley's attorneys, Stephen Kaufman, said Mondaythat he thought the couple would not fall victim to the curse.   ``I'm sure the Helmsley's have broken the bad luck streak atDunnnellen,'' Kaufman said.   Louis Duff, president of Duff Associates Inc., which handled thesale of the estate for Lynda Dick, widow of Jack Dick, said theproperty had been compared to a famous gem with a bad reputation.   ``She (Lynda) said this place is like the Hope Diamond _everyone who ever owned it and lived here had bad luck,'' Duff saidMonday. ``I argued with Lynda at the time, but I wouldn't arguewith her today.''   According to the book ``Diamonds Eternal,'' by Victor Argenzio,the gem was owned by Louis XVI, who went to guillotine with hiswife. A Dutch cutter who changed the stone's appearance had thestone stolen from him by his own son who later killed himself.   Turkish sultan Abdul Hamid II, lost his throne and had toabdicate shortly after aquiring stone in 1908, the book said.   Later, after Edward and Evalyn McLean acquired the stone, theirfirst son was killed in an auto crash, and McLean was implicated inthe Teapot Dome scandal and died in mental institution.   After Mrs. McLean's death in 1947, the diamond was purchased byHarry Winston, who gave it to the current owner, the SmithsonianInstitution in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
