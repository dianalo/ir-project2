 People are no longersatisfied with just a lock on the front of the fascia.andM;The three PC security aids reviewed here go far beyond password access todata files.andP;  You certainly can't just boot from a floppy disk to get roundthem, and two out of the three use hardware as well as software: a plug-incard in the case of PC Security's Stoplock and an infrared key in the case ofVisitec's PCBootandM;Stoplock IVandM;All Stoplock's functions are controlled by code stored in ROM on the 8-bitcard, so there are no floppy disks to mess around with: this makes it veryeasy to install and use.andP;  The board itself provides three basic forms ofprotection: Xenix-like file and device (serial, parallel, disk) accesscontrol, transparent encryption and user log-ins.andM;All security aspects are controlled by the System Security Administrator(SSA), whose first task is to allocate log-in names and passwords for the 32supported users.andP;  The SSA can also restrict access to specific days andtimes, and set the minimum length for user-generated passwords and thepassword lifetime.andP;  As you might expect, attempts to hack into the PC willmake Stoplock disable the system after the preset number of invalid log-inshave been exceeded, and will alert the SSA with a note in the system audit.andM;The main security feature of the Stoplock board is to allow the SSA tospecify who's allowed to read, write or execute every file on the system.andO;Similar access control can also be applied to directory entries, protectingtheir entire contents at a stroke.andP;  This makes it possible, for example, togive each user their own private directory, and also to provide a commondirectory of, for example, utilities which can be executed but not copied ordeleted.andP;  A nice touch is that if a user doesn't have access permission to adirectory, it won't show up in the DIR listing, so it's very easy to keep theuninvited totally in the dark as to what goodies may be on the hard disk.andM;The Stoplock system also supports the concept of 'groups'.andP;  A group is set upin the same way as a normal user: it has its own file, device and time accesspermissions.andP;  The difference is that normal users can then be put into thesegroups; they then instantly inherit all the group's settings.andP;  This makeslife much easier for the SSA, who can add new users very quickly, or changethe setup for a large number of people just by editing a group'scharacteristics.andM;Access control can also be extended to floppy disk-based programs and data.andO;To do this, the SSA must log the contents of individual disks through themain control program and apply access permissions in the same way as for harddisk-based files.andP;  This process can be a bit tedious, but it does providevery effective control over what can and can't be run on the host PC.andM;Floppy disks can also be protected by assigning them an access password.andO;This allows data to be sent between sites with full protection, because theonly way to get data back off the disk is to know the correct password and touse the floppy disk in a machine with a Stoplock board.andP;  Surprisingly, onlydrive A: seemed to be supported by the reviewed board, so life might bedifficult for users wanting to protect, for example, a different sized floppydisk in drive B:.andM;The second security feature offered by Stoplock IV is a two-tier level offile encryption.andP;  First, there's total encryption of the hard disk using an8-character system key entered and known only by the SSA.andP;  This protectsevery user on the system and makes all files totally unreadable to outsiders,even if they're armed with their favourite disk-hacking utilities or if theyremove the Stoplock board.andP;  Total encryption is transparent to users, exceptfor an additional delay as read files are decrypted on the fly and thenrescrambled when written back to disk.andP;  The second level allows users toencrypt individual files using their own personal key.andP;  This would ensurethat some or all files are still protected if a user's log-in name andpassword is hacked.andM;The stoplock system also provides a utility called 'softhold'.andP;  This allowsusers to temporarily password-protect the PC while they go for a tea break orstop to read their copy of PC User.andP;  Softhold also activates itself if the PCis left idle too long with a user logged in.andP;  In either case, the machine canonly be restored to a usable state by re-entering the password for the usercurrently working on the machine.andM;All the security options available to the SSA (and the limited set providedfor mere mortals) are provided in the form of a pop-up menu-driven utilityprogram that can be hot-keyed at almost any time, even when in the middle ofsome programs.andP;  As well as all the access controls, there are useful optionsfor such things as 'super erasing' files to ensure that even Mr Norton andhis utilities can't get his hands on them.andP;  There's also a separate menu thatallows the SSA to view, print or delete the comprehensive audit generated bythe board for incidents such as illegal file accesses, expired passwords andwho's using the system and when.andM;The Stoplock package comes with two small-format, spiral-bound manuals; onefor the SSA and one for authorized users.andP;  The manuals contain almosteverything that anyone would need to know, but unfortunately they appear notto have kept up with all the card's firmware revisions, as some menu optionsdon't appear in the books and vice versa.andM;My only other niggle concerns the irritatingly slow response of the menusystem.andP;  This is probably because everything is run from ROM, but it doesmean that rapid key-bashing can take you into the wrong sub-menu and you canchange the wrong setting if you're not keeping an eye on things.andO;Nevertheless, despite these two provisos, this must be one of the mostcomprehensive and easiest security systems to install and administer.andM;PCBootandM;The PCBoot protection system does almost as well as the Stoplock system forlack of floppy disks -- there's just one.andM;Not to be outdone, though, this security system compensates by providing youwith your own key-fob in the form of a small hand-held device called an'access key'.andP;  You may be familiar with the Apricot Qi's 'key-card' securitydevice that operates like a one-button TV remote control by squirting a beamof infrared identity code to the base unit that supplements the usual nameand password.andM;The ThumbScan access key turns this idea on its head: it receives encodeddata in the form of flashing white squares from the PC's monitor and usesthis to generate a one-time alphanumeric code on its built-in LCD display.andO;Use of this extra level of security is optional but, if implemented, theever-changing code needs to be typed in as part of PCBoot's log-in procedureand also when running protected programs.andM;The rest of the PCBoot security system is very similar in function, althoughdifferent in implementation, to that of Stoplock's.andP;  It consists of abattery-backed card and a security environment that controls user names andpasswords, auto or manual file encryption and access to the serial, paralleland floppy disk devices.andM;Unlike Stoplock, though, PCBoot offers no specific protection for floppydisk-based programs and data, apart from the ability to completely stop usersfrom accessing the floppy disk drives.andM;Security administrators also have the usual control and audit facilities,allowing them to set time and date restrictions, including for groups.andP;  Italso includes a new feature called 'project codes' -- these allow users tolog not only into the PC, but also into a 'project', for the purposes ofauditing the time spent on a particular undertaking so that you can presentyour customer with the appropriate bill at the end.andM;Installing the security environment is just as easy as Stoplock's, exceptthat first it must be loaded from floppy disk.andP;  Like the Stoplock board,PCBoot's does have some jumpers to configure the ROM and RAM addresses; butunlike the former, there are no interrupts to mess around with.andP;  Softwaresupplied with the system allows you to check that the card is configuredproperly for your PC.andM;One additional step that needs to be completed is the registration of eachaccess key to be used on the system.andP;  The first unit (supplied with the basicsystem) and others purchased later come with a disk-based information filethat tells PCBoot about the key's configuration, so the security shell knowshow to verify that the access codes typed in from the key's LCD displays arecorrect.andM;PCBoot's security features are no less effective than Stoplock's, but theimplementation isn't quite as tidy.andP;  First, the system administrator 'enrols'new users.andP;  At this stage, passwords, log-in time/device restrictions, groupmembership and so on can be specified.andP;  There's no menu-driven utility toallow the system administrator to set up file access permissions.andP;  Instead,these are assigned by the users as they scramble their individual data files;as part of the scrambling procedure, users enter the names or groups whoshould also be allowed to access the file.andM;Obviously, the scrambling can be done by the system manager, but the wholeprocess would be easier if it was a bit more automated.andP;  The same applies toprogram protection -- called 'locking' -- except that locking permanentlyadds code to the start of the program, so an unprotected backup should alwaysbe stored safely elsewhere.andM;Legitimate users who are trying to get at a scrambled file or locked programmust use their infra-red access keys in both cases if they've been assignedone as part of their log-in procedure.andP;  This use of the key obviously adds anextra level of security, but it can be rather tiresome if you're movingrapidly from program to program.andM;The comprehensive manual supplied with this system serves both normal usersand system administrators.andP;  The whole package is very well put together andthe access key is a very novel and useful supplement to the security system.andM;I did, however, discover an obscure but potential flaw that would leave thehost PC totally unprotected unless all the features of this package wereimplemented.andP;  Although a worrying feature, I'd suggest in PCBoot's defencethat anyone taking the trouble of purchasing a security system would want todo the job properly anyway.andM;It's also worth noting that the access key unit is protected to the extentthat attempts to open the moulded case will result in the destruction of theelectronics inside -- let's hope that the case doesn't accidently break insomeone's pocket.andM;PC GuardandM;PC Guard represents the only UK-developed security package of the threereviewed here.andP;  It's also different from Stoplock and PCBoot in that it'ssupplied entirely on floppy disk.andP;  The package can be purchased in twovariants: 'professional' -- for use on a single PC -- and 'corporate', whichallows one system manager to install and administer the product on 10 or morePCs.andP;  For this review, I managed to get my hands on the corporate version.andM;The software is supplied on both 3-1/2-inch and 5-1/4-inch disks, togetherwith a hefty 420-page manual.andP;  Looking at the sheer weight of documentationwrongly gives the impression that installation is going to be a lengthyprocess; although it's clearly not as simple as opening the system unit andfitting a card, it's nevertheless surprisingly straightforward.andM;The installation process allows the administrator to specify one of threelevels of security for the host PC: 'minimum', 'maximum' and 'custom'.andP;  Themaximum option probably speaks for itself -- the PC is treated to the fullworks: user access control, file encryption, resource (directory) encryption,boot protection, low-level disk I/O protection and workstation time-out.andM;The minimum option just installs access control, boot protection andworkstation timeout, while the custom option offers a pick-and-mix approach.andM;Everything, including this part of the package, is menu-driven, and if thesystem administrator decides to add or remove one or more of the securityfeatures at a later date, the installation program can simply be rerun.andM;Like PCBoot and Stoplock, the first thing that the administrator must do isgive names and passwords for all users of the system.andP;  Again, this is allmenu-driven, and includes all the usual options to limit access to the floppydisk drives and serial and parallel ports, and to specify into which filesand directories users can poke their noses.andP;  PC Guard doesn't actuallysupport groups, but it does offer a feature called 'projects'.andM;Unlike PCBoot's projects, which are used for auditing purposes, PC Guard'sapproach is to allow users a second level of log-in as well as the usual nameand password.andP;  By logging in to one of their three allotted projects, usersautomatically gain the access rights given to the project by the systemadministrator, and they effectively become temporary members of a group.andM;The system administrator has command of all the usual features, such as avery comprehensive user auditing facility, as well as the ability to extractfrom the encrypted security database valuable information about the users onthe system.andP;  This information includes their access permissions and securityparameters, and can be compiled into reference lists or used for auditingpurposes.andM;The PC Guard manual devotes a whole chapter to how the extracted informationis formatted, so that it can be easily manipulated by database packages orsoftware written in-house.andP;  Before you even think about it, this informationcan only be extracted by the system manager, who isn't allowed to list thepasswords.andM;Up to now, PC Guard has been fairly conventional, however, there's one verysimple, but useful, option that would make the corporate version of interestto multi-PC sites: the 'deploy' function.andP;  This simply allows the main systemadministrator to create a custom copy of the basic PC Guard package and tocontrol its distribution around the corporate environment, so everysubsequent installation inherits the same specification as the original.andO;This removes the need for the poor, overworked DP manager to visit every PCthat has to be protected and key in the initial settings, names, passwordsand so on of every user allowed access to the machine.andM;The deploy utility also highlights the role of 'local administrators'.andP;  Thesecan be set up during the initial installation.andP;  They have the same controlover the security environment as the main administrator, so they cancustomize the security setup within their own little empires.andM;The manual that accompanies PC Guard is very substantial.andP;  Even so, its400-odd pages are surprisingly easy to navigate, and the clearly-writtenexamples make finding the right section very easy indeed.andM;Overall, PC Guard has been well thought out and offers a good selection ofsecurity tools.andP;  While all three review packages here have offered a verysimilar set of features, PC Guard's deploy option makes it stand out from therest.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
