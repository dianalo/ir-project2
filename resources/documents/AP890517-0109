Elsewhere in Texas, serious flooding in the Dallas-Fort Wortharea forced hundreds of people to evacuate to higher ground, andtwo people were killed when their vehicles were swept away inrain-swollen creeks. Police and firefighters performed severaldramatic rescues as the severe storm system brought a second day oftwisters, hail and heavy rain to the Southwest.   ``I've been standing in water up to my elbows for the lastcouple hours trying to get a couple gals out of a tree,'' saidKennedale Police Chief David Geeslin. Their car had been washed offthe road.   In the Northeast, showers stretched from eastern Virginia tosouthern New England. There was widespread flooding in northern NewJersey.   The pre-dawn tornado caused widespread damage in the little townof Jarrell, 40 miles north of Austin, when it stayed on the groundfor about seven miles, carving a mile-wide path of destruction.   ``There was extensive damage downtown. A 15-unit apartmentcomplex was destroyed,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman for the TexasDepartment of Public Safety. Williamson County Sheriff Jim Boutwellsaid about 15 homes also were destroyed.   ``It looked to me like more than one twister went through therebecause there were some parallel areas'' of damage, he said.   Several homes and businesses and the roof of the high school gymwere damaged, and at least six tractor-trailers were overturned onInterstate 35, causing authorities to temporarily close a six-milestretch of the road.   The body of a 42-year-old woman was found in the debris of amobile home destroyed by the tornado, Boutwell said. A man who wasin the mobile home was uninjured.   Hospitals in Georgetown and Temples said 24 people soughttreatment and at least three were hospitalized. A police spokesmanhad earlier reported 30 people injured, and it was not known ifsome residents were treated at the scene.   The Williamson County Sheriff's Department said at least threeother reports of extensive damage came from the southern andsouthwestern parts of the county, where two more tornadoes weresighted.   In the Dallas area, a woman was killed when she drove around abarricade and her car was swept from a bridge into a creek, and thebody of an elderly man was recovered from a truck in a creekbranch, police said.   From 150 to 200 people were evacuated from south Dallas, 50people from Grand Prairie, and 125 to 150 from Kennedale, policesaid.   A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man whohad gone to check his cattle and was stranded by rapidly risingwaters, Geeslin said.   The tornadoes came as severe thunderstorms unleashed twisters,flash flooding and hail across a vast expanse of Texas from the RioGrande to the Red River.   ``I've been working here since 1973 and this is the worstthunderstorm I've ever seen,'' said Warren Kneis, supervisor forthe Federal Aviation Administration at the Dallas-Fort Worthairport control tower.   In addition to Texas, which got 7 inches of rain in some parts,flood warnings were also issued for parts of Louisiana andOklahoma. A tornado touched down near Westcliffe, Colo., and hugehail pelted Louisiana and Oklahoma.   A weekend storm that damaged more than half of the 190 Apachetank-killer helicopters at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, could cost$500 million, said Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of theHouse Defense Appropriations Committee.   The weather service said 19 tornadoes had been reported in Texassince Tuesday morning.   Gainesville, a city of 14,000 people about 60 miles northwest ofDallas, was among the hardest hit Tuesday. National Guardsmenhelped evacuate about 150 homes in low-lying areas threatened byfloods, said state Trooper M. Dial. Most evacuees were taken out byboat.   Animals at Gainesville's Frank Buck Zoo were taken to a cattleauction barn because of flooding. Eighteen deer were missing, saidMilburn Cravens, Gainesville's director of community services.   Emergency workers sandbagged houses in low-lying areas ofIdabel, Okla., after heavy rains threatened flooding. A flash floodwatch was still in effect today for much of southern Oklahoma.Thunderstorms also pelted the western part of the state.   In northern New Jersey, 11 counties were under flood warnings,after another 2 inches of rain in the past 24 hours drenched thealready saturated area.   There was widespread flooding in the Newark area, with water 2to 3 feet deep clogging entrances to roads and stalling cars. Eightresidents of Westwood, N.J., who live near the Pascack Brook wereevacuated early today.   Area meteorologists said more rain has fallen in the first 15days of May than usually falls in the whole month. Newarkregistered 4.2 inches between May 1 and midnight Monday, before thenew rains began, compared with an average of 3.6 inches for thewhole month.   Similarly, the amount of rain that has fallen in theBaltimore-Washington area in May is well over the average total forthe month.   The National Weather Service reported that a stretch of 13consecutive days of rain in May through today is the longest in 40years of record-keeping at Baltimore-Washington InternationalAirport. The previous record for May was nine days set in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
