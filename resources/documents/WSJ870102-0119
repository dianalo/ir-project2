Canada agreed to the tax in a settlement reached Tuesday in Washington on the longstanding, bitter dispute. If an agreement hadn't been reached by then, the U.S. would have applied a countervailing duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, valued at about $3 billion a year, or about one-third of U.S. supplies.    A.H. Zimmerman, president of Toronto-based Noranda Inc. and chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council, said that a 15% tax would represent more than the entire profit of the Canadian softwood industry.    The two countries agreed to try and reach a settlement after the U.S. Commerce Department, in a preliminary finding Oct. 16, ruled that Canadian softwood lumber exports were being subsidized by an estimated 15%. In return for the Canadian export tax, the U.S. lumber industry dropped its petition for countervailing duties on Canadian softwood.    The pact was welcomed by the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, which respresents most of the U.S. lumber industry. In Washington, a spokesman for the coalition called it &quot;a real, permanent and enforceable solution&quot; to the dispute.    The Canadian softwood lumber industry is opposed to the agreement. Michael Apsey, a spokesman for the Canadian Forest Industries Council, said he was &quot;dismayed&quot; at the settlement &quot;because it imposes an unjustified, heavy financial burden on the Canadian industry.&quot;    The Canadian lumber industry has opposed the Canadian government's negotiating tactics and had pressed for a much smaller levy on Canadian exports.    Among current trade issues, the softwood lumber case was the most acrimonious dispute and was threatening to jeopardize current talks between the two governments aimed at removing trade barriers.    The lumber pact raised fears in Canada that other U.S. industries might seek similar, negotiated settlements to trade disputes with Canada, its largest trading partner. Daniel Romanko, a spokesman for the Canadian Steel Producers Association, said there is concern among Canadian steelmakers that their U.S. counterparts might try to use the lumber agreement as leverage to negotiate cutbacks of Canadian steel exports to the U.S.    A Canadian government official called it a &quot;textbook case&quot; of how a U.S. industry lobby could &quot;get its way&quot; in a trade dispute. Canada negotiated the agreement to avoid a legal precedent and still maintains that Canadian lumber isn't subsidized.    Under the pact's provisions, the export tax will eventually be replaced by increased fees that provinces charge forest companies for standing timber. The calculation of the value of such replacement measures will be subject to U.S. government agreement.    The lumber-producing provinces promoted a negotiated settlement because they are expected to receive all the proceeds from the levy, including the export charge. If the U.S. had applied a countervailing duty, the proceeds would have gone into the U.S. Treasury.    The export charge will apply to the final mill price of all softwood lumber, including cedar, pine, fir, and spruce products. It won't, however, be applied to the value added in manufacturing some softwood products, such as flooring, finish, and most ceiling, siding and paneling.    The lumber agreement may be annulled by either side with 30 days notice. As part of the settlement, Canada won't proceed with its complaint before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. The complaint maintained the U.S. countervailing-duty case represented unfair harassment. </TEXT></DOC>
