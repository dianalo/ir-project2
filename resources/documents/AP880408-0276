Prices on world markets slipped slightly in quiet trading. Brentblend crude from the North Sea traded in London for May delivery at$15.60 a barrel, down 10 cents from Thursday's close. At the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, May contracts for West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, stood at $16.88 per barrel,down 18 cents.   Indonesia's oil minister said on his arrival that the meeting,set to start Saturday, was unlikely to produce any changes in theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' current oil policy.   ``I don't think we'll decide anything that will change the pastdecision of OPEC,'' the minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, toldreporters as he prepared for his first OPEC session since takingover his country's top oil post in March.   In the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, the official Saudi pressagency quoted King Fahd as calling on OPEC to display greatersolidarity. It said he accused some unidentified cartel members ofcheating on OPEC rules by offering price discounts.   Last December, OPEC agreed to retain existing oil productionquotas for the individual member countries in hope of holdingprices at $18 a barrel. A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons.   Since then, however, open-market prices for OPEC oil haveslipped to levels between $15 and $18 a barrel, despitestronger-than-usual efforts by the key producers to abide by theirproduction quotas.   Paul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant, said OPEC oilproduction in March probably was not much above its officialceiling for 12 members of 15.06 million barrels a day. Iraq, the13th member, is not included in the December agreement and isbelieved to be pumping about 2.5 million barrels daily.   Thus total OPEC output is thought to be about 17.6 millionbarrels daily.   ``It beats me what they can do'' now to drive prices back up to$18 a barrel, McDonald said in a telephone interview.   The five OPEC ministers, representing Saudi Arabia, Nigeria,Venezuela, Algeria and Indonesia, are expected to assess oil marketconditions and recommend action for the next full meeting of thecartel, which is set for June 8 here.   Ginandjar told reporters he saw little chance that a specialconference of all 13 members would be called before June.   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister and chairman of theweekend meeting, said OPEC was not satisfied with the current levelof oil prices.   ``We wanted a price of $18; we haven't got it,'' he toldreporters Thursday. He declined to discuss possible actions toraise the price.   The five OPEC ministers, constituting the cartel's recentlycreated price-monitoring committee, also are to review a Dutchauditing firm's report on January and February production levels byindividual OPEC members.   One of OPEC's biggest problems in seeking to influence oilprices through production controls is a lack of timely and reliableinformation about the production of its own members. Some,including Persian Gulf war rivals Iran and Iraq, consider such datato be state secrets.   Some analysts said OPEC had to cut its production further inorder to reverse the decline in prices.   ``The market is signaling that this is what is needed, but Idon't see it happening,'' said Graham Andrews, an analyst at theinvestment firm of Wood, Mackenzie and Co. in London.   Andrews said there was not much Saturday's meeting could do,given the continuing worldwide oversupply of oil and OPEC'sinability to agree on new output cuts.   ``I suspect it's going to be brave words but not anything morethan that,'' he said.   Andrews said he believed oil prices in the open market werelikely to decline by as much as $1.50 a barrel over the next twomonth before stabilizing.   Although this weekend's talks may not influence the short-termdirection of prices, they may provide clues about shifts in OPEC'slong-term strategy.   A key question for OPEC now is whether to resort to itstraditional tactic of cutting production in an effort to bolsterprices.   Some analysts think a consensus among key OPEC members may beemerging that the cartel should draw a line on sacrificingproduction, since non-OPEC producers such as Mexico and the SovietUnion are only taking up the production slack that OPEC hascreated. As a result OPEC has been losing on both volume and price.</TEXT></DOC>
