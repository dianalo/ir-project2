These exams cannot only detect the presence, but also suggest the histologic diagnosis,of polypoid lesions of the colon. An Olivetti M24 Personal Computer wasused to create a software to study the results obtained by double contrastenema, and to compare them with endoscopy and pathology. The data baseis formed by 7 files: one anagraphic, 3 collecting the characteristicsof the diagnosis - namely the radiologic, the endoscopic and the pathologicone - and 3 multiple files featuring each lesion, as defined by the threediagnostic techniques. The software allows to evaluate the differentlesions that can be detected by three techniques in the same patientand to compare the diagnosis of presence to the morphologic featuresof each lesion. False negatives and false positive of each techniqueare easily recognized. It is also possible to characterize the singlemorphological feature leading the radiologist and/or the endoscopistto express an opinion about the histologic diagnosis of each lesion andto compare them with pathological features. The first experience in clinicaluse of the software, in the analysis of the characters of 336 lesionsin 218 patients, is described.</TEXT></DOC>
