The plaintiff, Terri Sabol, sought the rights of a parent andeven offered to pay child support.   Ruling Friday after a non-jury trial, Superior Court Judge DanaHenry said the case ventured into uncharted legal ground, andadded, ``it is absolutely imperative that the Legislaturere-examine its laws.''   ``I'm shocked, really shocked,'' said Sabol, 33, owner of a LongBeach hair salon and the only party in the case who was publiclyidentified.   The child was referred to as Baby B and her mother wasidentified only as Susan. The trial was conducted behind closeddoors, as is usual in cases determining parental rights, but thejudge ruled in open court.   Sabol will appeal, said her attorney, Gloria Allred.   ``We believe that persons who are gay and lesbian have the rightto be parents,'' Ms. Allred said. ``Ms. Sabol became a parent inthe only way that she could.''   Allred argued that her client deserved parental rights under alegal doctrine that recognizes a parent-child bond between a childand person who acts as a parent but is neither the biological oradoptive parent.   Henry ruled Sabol failed to prove such a bond existed.   The mother's lawyer, Glen Schwartz, said the ruling wasconsistent with state law.   Testimony showed Susan was the mother and Steve Sabol was thebiological father.   Sabol and her ``life partner'' decided in March 1985 they wanteda child. Part of the decision was that the other woman would carrythe baby because Sabol ``was in a better position to be the breadwinner,'' Allred said.   Sabol's brother, Steve, donated sperm for the artificialinsemination procedure, which was performed by Sabol.   The other woman became pregnant in April 1986 and a girl wasborn Dec. 16, 1986. The child's parentage made Sabol the girl'saunt.   Allred said Sabol supported her partner through her pregnancyand served as a parent until the women's relationship broke up inJuly 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
