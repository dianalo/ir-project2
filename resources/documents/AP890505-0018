North and the disposition of each charge:   Counts 1-4: Obstruction and making false statements in Septemberand October 1985 in connection with letters to Congress denyingthat the National Security Council staff was assisting the Contras.   Count 1, obstruction. Not guilty: Former National SecurityAdviser Robert McFarlane testified that North was the source offalse information in the letters. But McFarlane blamed himself, notNorth, saying the aide ``was probably trying to protect me.''McFarlane signed the letters and later pleaded guilty towithholding information from Congress.   North testified that he unsuccessfully sought to have the Reaganadministration invoke executive privilege and refuse to answer thecongressional inquiries.   The letter to then-House Intelligence Committee chairman LeeHamilton said that ``we did not solicit funds or other support. ...We did not offer tactical advice'' to the Contras.   A fund-raiser for the Contras, Carl ``Spitz'' Channell,testified that on Sept. 11, 1985, North, after describing therebels' military needs, told billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, ``Idon't care if I have to go to jail for this. I don't care if I haveto lie to Congress about this.'' Hunt later contributed more thanhalf a million dollars to the Contra cause. The conversation wassix days after the letter to Hamilton and a day before anotherfalse letter was sent to then-Rep. Michael Barnes denying the NSCwas assisting the Contras.   North testified he never solicited money for the Contras, thatinstead he gave numerous talks to prospective donors and then wouldleave before Channell asked for money.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 2, false statements to Congress in connection with theSept. 5, 1985, letter to Hamilton. Not guilty:   North testified he prepared only two innocuous paragraphs of theletter to Hamilton. North acknowledged under cross-examination thathe edited the letter but said he had no authority to makesubstantive changes.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 3, false statements to Congress in connection with theSept. 12, 1985, letter to Barnes. Not guilty:   North testified he had nothing to do with the Barnes letter. AnFBI agent testified that a draft of the response to Barnes wasfound in North's office.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 4, false statements to Congress in connection with aletter responding to congressional followup questions from Hamiltonon Oct. 7, 1985. Not guilty:   North testified that his answers were based on informationMcFarlane provided. A note by the NSC's legal counsel said thatMcFarlane was taking complete charge of the job of responding tothe inquiries.   Daniel Conrad, the liaison between North and a privatefund-raising operation for the Contras, testified that North voicedirritation in a meeting in the fall of 1985 about having to answer``asinine questions'' from Congress.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 5, obstructing a proposed congressional inquiry on Aug. 6,1986, by denying giving military advice to the Contras. Not guilty:   North admitted he told lies in his meeting with the HouseIntelligence Committee. After the meeting, then-National SecurityAdviser John Poindexter sent him a note saying, ``Well done.''North said he told Poindexter beforehand it would be unwise to meetwith the committee but that Poindexter insisted he do so.   The key question was whether North lied to prevent a pendingresolution of inquiry into the Contra matter from passing in theHouse. Only sketchy notes were taken at the meeting in the WhiteHouse, and no transcript was kept. The judge told the jury to notethat ``there is conflicting evidence as to whether or not theresolution was or was not pending'' and that jurors had to decidewhether the meeting with North was designed to gather material forthe resolution.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 6, aiding and abetting obstruction of Congress in November1986 in the preparation of a false and misleading chronology sayingthat no one in the U.S. government knew until January 1986 that aCIA-assisted shipment from Israel to Iran in November 1985contained Hawk missiles. Guilty:   The jury found North not guilty on the charge of obstruction ofCongress in this count, but then found him guilty of the subsidiarycharge of aiding and abetting that obstruction.   Testifying in his own defense, North blamed McFarlane, who byNovember 1986 had been out of the government for a year, forformulating the false chronology.   North also testified that Poindexter and then-CIA DirectorWilliam Casey knew that missiles were aboard the plane and thatother top U.S. officials knew because intelligence agencies trackedthe shipment hour-by-hour. Despite that, he said, Poindexter andCasey helped prepare false testimony for Congress saying that noone in the government knew the true cargo until January 1986.   North testified that it was necessary to maintain a false coverstory about the shipment in order to protect the lives of U.S.hostages held in Lebanon. The Iranians were not satisfied with theshipment, and North said the U.S. government needed to distanceitself from the transaction.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
