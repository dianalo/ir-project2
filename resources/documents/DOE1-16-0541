It decays to radioactive daughters, which if breathedin, irradiate the lungs, and may increase the risk of lung cancer. TheBoard recently recommended that exposure to radon daughters in the homeshould be limited. The essence of the recommendations is that there shouldbe an Action Level of 20 mSv per annum for existing dwellings and anUpper Bound of 5 mSv per annum for future dwellings, the values referringto the effective dose equivalent. The recommendations, which are qualifiedin a number of important ways, were published as formal advice on standardsof radiation protection. Additional guidance on the background informationand evaluation underlying these standards is given in this document.</TEXT></DOC>
