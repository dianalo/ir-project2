Light sweet crude oil for December delivery was down 81 cents to$29.60 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in earlytrading. January and February delivery contracts were also lower,but later months were higher.   Today's mixed prices appeared to put at least a temporary haltto oil's recent rapid decline, which resulted in a record fall of$5.41 per barrel on Monday. The big drop came as November contractswere traded for the last time and pushed those contracts to $28.38at the close.   December contracts had not fallen that far on Monday because oftrading limits imposed by the exchange, so the spot price of oilwas actually higher this morning.   The big falls have come as traders determined a peacefulsolution in the Persian Gulf seemed more likely than war. They havestripped away more than half of the ``war premium'' that sharplypushed up prices to the $40-per-barrel range in the weeks followingIraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.   Refined petroleum products were also moving in differentdirections today amid the confused trading.   Home heating oil was up 3.37 cents to 79.35 cents per gallon onNovember contracts. Winter and early spring delivery contracts wereall lower, while late spring and summer contracts were higher.   Unleaded gasoline was up 4.20 cents to 80.70 cents per gallon onNovember contracts. Winter and spring delivery contracts weretrading lower, while contracts for next fall were moving up.   Earlier today, oil prices had moved up more than $1 per barrelin London, where European traders said some doubts had arisen aboutthe market's perception on Monday that a negotiated peacefulsolution was close in the Gulf crisis.   The London market's rebound appeared to be a combination of acorrection from drop on Monday of more than $5 a barrel and areassessment of how likely the Gulf crisis is to be resolvedpeacefully.   ``Prices just went down too fast'' over the past couple oftrading sessions, one London trader said.   Traders said that comments by Saudi Arabian governmentofficials, including King Fahd, suggesting that the kingdom hasn'tabandoned its hard-line position against Iraq helped turn themarket around. Oil's big plunge on Monday was largely attributed tocomments from another ranking Saudi official that were seen as anindication Iraq might be able to keep some Kuwaiti territory in anegotiated settlement.   Traders in New York said that despite the later Saudistatements, it would likely take a renewed threat of war to pushprices up very far.</TEXT></DOC>
