Meanwhile, the federal Environmental Protection Agencyannounced yesterday that it will re-evaluate the risks ofexposure to dioxin, a highly toxic chemical believed to causesome cancers. The agency said it will complete the review inabout a year and re-examine its current dioxin disposalguidelines.</LP><TEXT>   North Carolina State University researchers working withthe EPA found that when the chlorine process used to bleachpulp in papermaking is stretched into a slow and continuousstep, dioxin and other chlorinated byproducts are halved fromlevels associated with current paper mill processes. Thebyproducts are reduced as much as 75% if chlorine dioxide, amore expensive bleaching agent, is substituted for purechlorine.   Some paper manufacturers familiar with the research saidthat the findings prove that the technique can be adoptedquickly and at little cost. It would also allow companiesmore time to explore chlorine-free bleaching processes thateliminate the byproducts altogether. &quot;The industry can stepback and evaluate the best alternatives,&quot; said Ronnie Hines,who heads pulp and bleaching operations at Westvaco Corp.,the New York paper manufacturer.   In recent years, paper mills have reduced discharges ofdioxin and other chlorinated pollutants to levels well belowthe EPA's recommended limit, which is 0.013 parts perquadrillion of effluent. While it is unclear how the EPA'sdioxin-risk re-evaluation would affect that limit,environmentalists are demanding that paper mills totallyeliminate chlorine as a bleaching agent. Some papermanufacturers are concerned that chlorine may one day becomea &quot;customer issue&quot; as plastic has become in packaging,whereby consumers demand an end to its use in papermaking.   Dioxin is one of 340 chlorinated byproducts formed whenchlorine is added to wood pulp. Added continuously in smallportions, chlorine acts more to break down the double bondsin the pulp's polymer, changing its color, than to form thehazardous chlorinated organic compounds, said MichaelOvercash, who heads the EPA's pollution prevention center atthe university. &quot;So most of the chlorine goes into doing thegood part of the job,&quot; he said.   Josef Gratzl, professor of wood and paper sciences at theuniversity and one of the researchers, said the techniquecompletes the bleaching process in about the same time asdoes combining the chlorine with pulp all at once. But JohnRenard, manager of chemical process technology atInternational Paper Co., based in Purchase, N.Y., said theslow, continuous chlorination &quot;wasn't feasible&quot; in a factory.&quot;But we aren't writing it off,&quot; he said. &quot;It's of tremendoustheoretical interest.&quot;   Westvaco's Mr. Hines, however, was more enthusiastic. Hiscompany recently adopted a similar bleaching process in whichchlorine is added in three batches. &quot;We have reduced dioxinto levels to where we can't detect it,&quot; he said, and addedthat the North Carolina State findings offer scientificsupport to the company's new approach. Westvaco is alsoexperimenting with a non-chlorine agent, ozone, among otherapproaches to deal with the dioxin issue. &quot;But allnon-chlorine technologies are very expensive,&quot; he said.   There are other problems with non-chlorine bleachingprocesses, said Mr. Renard of International Paper. He saidthe resulting pulp doesn't have the required strength nor isit clean. &quot;It is not to say that one day we won't be able todevelop chlorine-free alternatives, but these technologiesaren't developed well enough for use at the present time,&quot; hesaid.   Paper manufacturers, nevertheless, acknowledge that in thelong run they face the challenge of eliminating dioxinaltogether. &quot;Dioxin has developed a bad reputation,&quot; saidWestvaco's Mr. Hines. In December 1990, International Paperand Georgia-Pacific Corp., based in Atlanta, were nameddefendants in a $2 billion lawsuit that alleged that the twocompanies dumped dioxin and other pollutants into staterivers. They denied the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
