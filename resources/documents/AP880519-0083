The 1988 State of World Population Report, released in London onWednesday, says increasing human demands and population aredamaging the natural resources on which all life depends.   The report says world population, now at more than 5 billion, isexpected to reach 6.1 billion by the year 2000.   ``All countries must face the fact that the combination ofpopulation and industrial growth could destroy the land, water andair on which everything else depends,'' Dr. Nafis Sadik, executivedirector of the United Nations Population Fund, told a newsconference.   The Pakistani physician expressed hope that action bygovernments, individuals and international organizations to curbpopulation growth and encourage conservation will ``safeguard thefuture of our planet.''   But ``population and resources could become more seriously outof balance unless we do something about it today,'' she said.   Every year, the world adds a nation the size of Mexico to thepopulation _ about 80 million people _ with nearly all the growthoccurring in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin Americathat are least able to absorb it, the report says.   It says that though most developing countries are trying toreduce population growth, their needs are increasing and theirattempts to find new land and increase food production aredestroying the environment rapidly.   ``There is urgent need for action ... In the poorest areas, the`scissors effect' of poverty and increasing population is slicingaway at their ability to sustain human life.''   The report encourages slower growth and more even distributionof population to take pressure off agricultural land, forests andwater and energy sources.   Tropical forests are shrinking at a rate of 27 million acres ayear. Topsoil is being lost at the rate of 26 billion tons a year.About 13 million acres of deserts are being created each year andabout half the world's irrigated land is in danger, it says.   By the end of the century, half the world will be living inurban areas and one-fifth of the urban population will live in``mega-cities'' of 4 million or more, the report says.   It says population growth will not stop ``for perhaps anothercentury, when world population may be over 10 billion, twice itspresent level.   ``Part of this dramatic rise in numbers is the result ofwidespread improvements in basic health care which have contributedto lower infant mortality ... and longer life spans. But the verysuccess of these interventions now threatens the future.''</TEXT></DOC>
