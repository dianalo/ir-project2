In surface waters, strong acids can causea lowering of the pH to a level where aquatic species cannot grow orreproduce. In some waters basic solutes, e.g. those in equilibrium withcalcium carbonate, are present so as to buffer the water and maintaina relatively constant pH as the acid pollutants are being deposited.However, an end point may eventually be reached, beyond which the pHdrops abruptly, and the ecosystem may suddenly change, resulting, forexample, in dieoffs of fish. Deposition of acid onto moist forest soilsmay be responsible for the death of trees, perhaps by a mechanism basedon microbiological processes in the soils on which the survival of thetrees depends. Toxic metal pollutants, deposited on soils, may be leachedby the deposition of acids, leading to an increase in the concentrationsof these elements available for uptake by plants or animals. In addition,the acid deposition may partly solubilize the soil minerals and organicmatter so as to release to solution naturally occurring metals that wouldnormally be bound and not be available to the organisms. Aluminum anabundant constituent of clay minerals, is a metal of special concern,since its aqueous phase concentration rises in acidified waters and issuspected to be a major factor in the dieoff of fish and the upset ofmicroflora necessary for the growth of trees. This article discussesthese pollutants and the results of several studies to see how the environmentis affected.</TEXT></DOC>
