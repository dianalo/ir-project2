S.A.    Fyffes &quot;has no further recourse under law in this matter,&quot; the highest legal authority in Ireland said.    Pernod is involved in a takeover battle for Irish Distillers against British food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan PLC.    The Fyffes stake, which would give Pernod 52.8% of Irish Distillers, was the center of a controversy that began in September, when Pernod said it made a binding oral agreement to buy the shares from Fyffes the day before Grand Met made a higher offer for Irish Distillers.    The Irish Distillers board has suggested that its shareholders take the lower, 450 Irish pence ($6.75) a share offer from Pernod because the French group has vowed to maintain the integrity of Irish Distillers. Grand Met's offer stands at 525 Irish pence a share, valuing Irish Distillers at 332 million Irish punt ($497.9 million).    Grand Met had no comment.    Britain's takeover panel is expected to rule today whether Irish Distillers shareholders may escape from agreements made to sell shares to Pernod. Analysts say it may be possible for Grand Met to prevail if shareholders are allowed to reconsider their positions. Grand Met claims to hold 33.24% of Irish Distillers. </TEXT></DOC>
