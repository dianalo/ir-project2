A 1986 immigration law authorized the State Department andImmigration and Naturalization Service to approach up to eightcountries to see if they were interested in participating in apilot project to determine if visa requirements could be waived insome cases.   Britain announced earlier this week that it is interested intaking part in the program, and U.S. spokeswoman Ruth van Heuvenconfirmed that Japan also has been asked to participate.   Current rules require all visitors, except Canadians, Bahamiansand some Mexicans, to obtain a visa to come to the United States.The normal process is for U.S. embassies to rule on visaapplications and check the names against lists of people barredfrom entry.   Visitors from some nations are required to prove they have themeans and the intention to go home again.   The pilot program would allow tourists and business people fromthe two countries to come to the United States for 90 days or lesswithout going through that process.   Among those for whom visas are required, Britons and Japanesetop the list of visitors to the United States. Last year, the StateDepartment issued nearly 1.2 million visas to citizens of Japan and496,000 visas to Britons.   Those two countries also are high up on the list of countrieswhere visa applications are rarely rejected.   Van Heuven said the program would not go into effect until theImmigration and Naturalization Service completes the installationof an automated arrival and departure system that would permitauthorities to monitor people coming and going from the UnitedStates. A completion date for the system has not been announced.   Under the 1986 law, the program would permit entry by peoplewith round-trip, non-transferable tickets, valid for a year or lessand not refundable in the United States.   Carriers also would be required to certify that they willprovide return transportation for the visitors.   Participating countries also would have to waive visarequirements for U.S. visitors. Britain does not require visas forAmericans, but Japan does.</TEXT></DOC>
