Last week, the count increased by eight to total 930; the countincreased by 17 in the previous week. A year ago, the number of rigstotaled 1,145.   Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge said the year-end surgecapped an otherwise disappointing quarter.   ``We normally would see a considerably greater increase than wehad in the fourth quarter,'' Kerridge said Tuesday. ``Normally, wesee an increase in drilling because companies are spending what wasleft in their drilling budgets. That didn't happen this year.''   The count averaged 922 working rigs in the fourth quarter,usually the strongest of the year, compared to 999 in the first, 901in the second and an average 924 rigs in the third quarter, Kerridgesaid.   ``It will probably be down again next week if it follows thenormal seasonal pattern,'' Kerridge said.   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activityand it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as oflast Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the number of working rigs since 1940.   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig countreached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in therig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes begancompiling figures.   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.   Among major oil producing states, the biggest gains were postedby Texas with 12 additional rigs, followed by Oklahoma, seven;Wyoming, six; Ohio, four; and Louisiana, two.   North Dakota had the biggest decline with six fewer rigs,followed by California, four; Colorado, three; Michigan, two; andNew Mexico, one. Kansas and Pennsylvania were unchanged from theprevious week.</TEXT></DOC>
