Much of this gas comes from upstreamgas field plants and has already been processed to recover products otherthan ethane. Recent demand for ethane in the oil fields has increasedthe field plants' interest in recovering the ethane themselves, thuscreating a dispute around the ownership, or at least the right to extractethane from, the gas produced in Alberta. In August 1987 a policy statementwas issued that established certain rules intended to ensure that industriesusing ethane would have access to adequate, competitive sources of supply.The basis of this new policy is the setting of a guaranteed thresholdvolume of ethane that could be extracted and supplied to the PetrochemicalProject from its straddle plants. A public inquiry was conducted to hearthe views of interested parties, and considered issues such as whichethane facilities should be affected, the principles involved in determiningthe threshold volume, and determination of procedures relating to applicationsfor ethane extraction at field plants. The key issues as seen by theinquiry participants related to where the threshold volume should bedefined, its magnitude, and the terms of reinjection or supply of ethaneto the Project to maintain the threshold volume. Recommendations weremade by the Energy Resources Conservation Board and were influenced byits conclusion that potential ethane supply is substantially higher thanthe expected Alberta demand. 5 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
