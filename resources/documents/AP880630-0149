(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists today began innoculating anacre of corn stalks in the first field test of a geneticallyengineered microbe designed to combat the European corn borer, oneof agriculture's most destructive pests.   Although researchers have conducted other experiments ofgenetically altered materials in the environment, the tests ofCxc-Bt at the federal experimental station here are the firstapproved of a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,'' scientists andfederal officials said.   Proponents of the Crop Genetics International project call thetesting a step toward an era of chemical-free pest control.   The company's chief scientist, Peter Carlson, said today hehoped Cxc-Bt will have the effect of making the corn borer sick.But he said the main purpose of the test is to determine whetherthe pesticide will spread from plant to plant, an undesireableeffect.   The microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of cornborers, giving them ulcers. It doesn't affect humans becausepeople's stomachs are acid and are unaffected by the Bt protein,according to researchers. In previous experiments in petrie dishesand in a greenhouse, the microbe killed the borers in the petriedishes and sickened them when tested in the greenhouse.   The pest costs American farmers $400 million annually.   Critics worry that Cxc-Bt experiment could set a precedent andare concerned that genetically engineered materials could spreaduncontrollably once released into the environment.   Environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society andthe Environmental Defense Fund, did not oppose the limited fieldtests begun today.   Environmental experts said if their questions about spreadingare answered with more tests, they may support the final product.   The crucial question for environmental groups is whether therewill be adequate testing and regulation because Cxc-Bt is just thebeginning of a rush of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of similiarproducts, said Maureen Hinkle, the Audubon Society's director ofagriculture policy.   Only one other genetic crop protector, a microbe altered tofight frost, has been approved for field testing by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency.   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation onEconomic Trends, said the pesticide hasn't been shown to work ingreenhouse tests.   Rifkin said today his organization did not oppose today's testbecause ``this product doesn't work. It does not kill corn borers.(The company's) evaluation data supplied to the EPA shows theproduct does not kill the insects. It poses no immediate threatbecause it doesn't work.''</TEXT></DOC>
