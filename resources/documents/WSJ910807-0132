The Fed acted after a telephone conference yesterdaymorning among members of the central bank's policy committee,officials said. The move lowers the Fed's target for thefederal funds interest rate to 5 1/2% from 5 3/4%, where ithad been since late April. The federal funds rate is the rateon overnight loans between banks. Other interest rates areexpected to fall as a result, giving a modest boost to theeconomy.</LP><TEXT>   The cut in interest rates underscores growing concernsabout the health of the U.S. economy. Fed officialsapparently continue to believe, as they evidently have sinceApril, that the recession is over and that an economicrecovery is under way. But their action yesterday shows theyare far from certain the recovery will be a strong one.   In particular, top Fed officials are increasinglyconcerned over the behavior of the nation's money supply,which has grown very slowly in recent months and actuallyposted a decline in July. Some fear that slow money growthmay signal a stagnant economy in the months ahead.   &quot;I don't think there is any member of the committee whodoesn't place some weight on the money numbers,&quot; RogerGuffey, president of the district Federal Reserve Bank ofKansas City, said in a telephone interview yesterdayafternoon. &quot;It varies from those who feel {the figures} haveimportant informational content to those who feel there isless.&quot; The slow money growth of recent months has caused someworry even among those who are most skeptical of the numbers.   In addition, Fed officials have been confronted in thepast few days with signs that economic growth remains anemic.A report released by the Labor Department Friday showed thatbusiness payrolls declined by 51,000 in July. A survey ofeconomic conditions in the 12 Federal Reserve districtsscheduled for release today also paints a picture of arecovery that is uneven at best, officials say. The surveysuggests that many business executives see no clear signs ofan upturn.   Fed officials say their willingness to ease credit alsoreflects continued good news on the inflation front. Friday'sunemployment report, for instance, showed a modest decline inaverage hourly earnings of workers, suggesting there islittle reason to fear wage inflation.   A rally in the bond markets Friday also helped encouragethe Fed's action. Some policy makers had been reluctant tocut short-term rates for fear that such a move would fuelinflation fears in the bond markets and thus have theperverse effect of causing long-term interest rates to rise.But the bond markets' actions over the past few weeks, andparticularly the rally that began Friday after the employmentfigures were announced, made it clear that the bond marketswould welcome action by the Fed. Both bonds and stocksrallied yesterday after the Fed's move, while the dollartumbled. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds ended the day at8.17%, down from 8.22% Monday.   The Bush administration has been publicly and privatelyleaning on the Federal Reserve in recent weeks to easecredit. Michael Boskin, the president's chief economicadviser, told reporters recently that unless the moneynumbers &quot;turned up very, very soon&quot; the Fed should &quot;moveseriously to get the money supply up.&quot;   In addition, presidents of the 12 district Fed banks --who have generally been more reluctant to cut interest ratesthan the Reserve Board's governors -- have come under someunusual political pressure. Four Democratic lawmakersintroduced a bill last week that would remove the presidentsfrom the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy panel thatmakes most major interest-rate decisions. The fourlegislators argued that the Fed presidents weren't appointedby the president or confirmed by the Senate and thereforeshouldn't be making such important government decisions. Byeasing credit, the Fed could undercut some of the support forsuch legislation.   Fed officials have argued recently about both the meaningand the makeup of the money-supply figures. The most closelywatched money measure, which is known as M2 and is made up ofcurrency, checking accounts and certain time deposits, hasbeen growing sluggishly for months. But some Fed policymakers had been taking comfort in the fact that a narrowermeasure -- M1, which includes only currency and checkingaccounts -- was growing much more rapidly.   In July, however, both M1 and M2 put in a poorperformance, increasing concern at the central bank andprompting yesterday's easing move.   Over the long run, many economists contend, growth in themoney supply is closely related to the rate of economicexpansion plus the rate of inflation. That's because themoney ultimately goes either to buy new goods and services orto bid up the cost of existing ones. While Fed officialswould like to see inflation come down, they worry that recentslow money growth could have an inordinate effect on economicgrowth.   At its new target level, the federal funds rate now isequal to the Fed's discount rate. The funds rate is thecentral bank's main policy tool; the discount rate -- therate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions -- isa largely symbolic rate that changes less frequently.   Fed officials have avoided sending the funds rate belowthe discount rate, for fear of confusing the financialmarkets. Thus, if money growth remains slow and the economyremains sluggish, the Fed could eventually have to lower boththe discount rate and the funds rate. Further Fed action,however, is unlikely until September at the earliest.</TEXT></DOC>
