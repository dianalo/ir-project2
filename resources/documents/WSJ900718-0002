The resolution of the Polish border issue came during aseven-nation meeting just a day after the Soviet Unionwithdrew its objections to a united Germany's membership inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviet shift cameas a surprise to both U.S. and West German officials, whosaid they hadn't expected Soviet acquiescence untilSeptember.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There is no obstacle for a united Germany to bere-established, with its sovereignty, by the end of theyear,&quot; said French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. U.S.Secretary of State James Baker said &quot;the advent of a united,democratic and sovereign Germany&quot; would occur by the firstanniversary of last February's agreement to launch theso-called two-plus-four unification talks.   The border deadlock was broken when the two German statespledged to sign a treaty recognizing the current Polishborder very quickly after unification is achieved. Inaddition, they promised to conclude later a second treatycovering other aspects of relations with Poland, includingeconomic guarantees. Poland's foreign minister, KrysztofSkubiszewski, said the treaty pledge, and related promises,were &quot;entirely satisfactory.&quot;   This week's events have eliminated the need for furtherhigh-level bargaining on German unification. All that remainsfor the creation of a &quot;final settlement&quot; on Germany -- ineffect, a treaty ending World War II -- is for second-levelofficials to draft the document for review by the foreignministers in Moscow in September and its adoption at a35-nation summit set to be held here on Nov. 19.   Approval of the treaty, coupled with an internal Germanagreement to merge, would set the stage for all-Germanelections Dec. 2, which would give birth to the new nation.   The Polish border agreement was overshadowed atyesterday's talks by Western pleasure -- and wonder -- at thesuddenness of the decision Monday by Soviet President MikhailGorbachev to clear the way for the West to claim all ofGermany in its military alliance. His move culminated anine-month series of Soviet retreats in central and easternEurope that largely have undone the territorial and politicalmoves of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in the years afterWorld War II.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze explained thatchanges in the nature of NATO had allowed the Soviets to&quot;take a new look&quot; at German membership in the alliance. Heand West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher bothheatedly denied that Bonn had purchased Soviet approval withpromises of large amounts of economic aid.   &quot;One cannot buy approval,&quot; Mr. Genscher asserted. Said Mr.Shevardnadze, &quot;There is no trade.&quot; German officials toldreporters that no specific new aid totals were pledged in theGerman-Soviet talks, but would be laid out later in twotreaties.   Both U.S. and German officials scrambled to counter theimpression that the historic events of the past few days tookplace largely without the involvement of Washington.Officials of both nations stressed repeatedly that all theGerman positions were discussed in advance with the Bushadministration, though they hadn't expected them to beaccepted for months.   Nevertheless, in contrast to previous &quot;two-plus-four&quot;meetings, Mr. Baker was a lonely figure at the crowded finalpress conference. He was asked no questions until late in thesession, when an American reporter asked him whether the U.S.was losing its clout. He stressed that the U.S. had longsupported the terms of the agreement now emerging.   As a result of the German promise to honor Poland'sborders and the Polish government's reaction, a StateDepartment official said, Mr. Baker felt it unnecessary tocarry out a threat he made Monday to propose that the fourvictorious World War II powers -- the U.S., Britain, Franceand the Soviet Union -- retain some rights over Germanborders until a treaty is signed.   That means that all of the World War II victors now haveagreed to relinquish their powers and rights in Germany atthe time of unification. U.S. officials said a treaty on thePolish border could be signed within days of unification andratified immediately after the new German parliament isorganized following the Dec. 2 vote.   The State Department official told reporters that Mr.Baker, after conferring with Messrs. Genscher andShevardnadze, is satisfied with the German-Soviet agreementthat led to Mr. Gorbachev's acceptance of German membershipin NATO.   Under the pact, according to German, Soviet and U.S.officials, NATO's mutual security umbrella would be extendedto protect East German territory even during the three tofour years that it will take for Soviet troops to withdraw.After they leave, NATO would be barred from stationingnon-German units there, though it could post German armyunits that are integrated into NATO's war plans.   Nuclear weapons would be barred on former East Germanterritory, though the question of nuclear weapons in formerWest Germany territory would be settled at previouslyannounced talks due to start this fall.   Despite fear in Europe of a powerful German state, theunderlying theme of yesterday's meeting was that the newGermany will live in peace with its neighbors. &quot;We can trustthe German people,&quot; Mr. Shevardnadze said. Mr. Genscher citedthe Soviet foreign minister's praise and said, &quot;This is atrust which is shared by all.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
