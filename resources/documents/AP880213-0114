(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dennis Clouthier is a conservativeRepublican _ pro-Star Wars, pro-Contra aid and opposed to theU.S.-Soviet nuclear arms treaty. Yet in 1986, he voted for aliberal Democrat for governor solely because the GOP incumbentchampioned the Seabrook nuclear power plant.   The stalled, $5.2 billion project on New Hampshire's seacoasthas been a leading state and regional issue throughout much of its16-year history. Now its foes hope voters like Clouthier will makeit an influential factor in the first presidential primary of the1988 season _ possibly ruining the presidential bid of VicePresident George Bush.   All seven major Democratic presidential candidates are to someextent opposed to Seabrook, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakisplaying a key role in blocking a license for the completed reactor.But there are some sharp distinctions among the five Republicanaspirants.   Seabrook opponents criticize pro-nuclear Republicans at thebottom of the polls _ former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and formertelevision evangelist Pat Robertson. But their chief target isBush, whose front-runner status in New Hampshire polls has beenjeopardized by his third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses.   Bush views on Seabrook have echoed those of his state campaignchairman, Gov. John Sununu: Its fate should be left to the NuclearRegulatory Commission, not state governors.   ``George Bush is going to do terribly on the seacoast amongRepublicans because of Seabrook, and it could end up costing himthe presidency,'' said Kurt Ehrenberg of Search '88. He noted thata little-known, anti-Seabrook challenger to Sununu in the 1986gubernatorial primary won 22 percent of the vote statewide, and upto 45 percent in some seacoast towns.   To try to help fulfill that prophecy, Ehrenberg's group lastweek began airing radio ad on seacoast stations that concluded:``If you don't want Seabrook, you don't want George Bush.''   Bush campaign aide Andrew Card disputed Ehrenberg's prediction.   ``I don't think (voters) are that parochial,'' Card said. ``Itwill be an issue, but one of many, many issues in the primary _ nota cutting issue.''   ``Electing a governor and electing a president are two differentthings,'' said Paul Young of New York Rep. Jack Kemp's campaign.But he also speculated that Seabrook could have an impact if itcosts Bush support on the seacoast.   Kemp, a strong proponent of states' rights, has asked federalregulators to hold up a low-power license for Seabrook beforeevacuation plans are developed that win the confidence of peoplewithin the plant's 10-mile emergency planning zone.   ``I want to make clear, he is not against nuclear power _ justfor the health and safety of the people,'' Young said.   However, the Kemp camp has not been trumpeting its positions onSeabrook.   ``I understand that. That's politics,'' said Mimi Fallon of thegroup Republicans Against Seabrook Station. ``They're afraidthey're going to lose the people they already have on the otherside'' who support the plant, said Fallon, who supports Kemp.   Another Republican hopeful, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, hassuggested that the non-partisan National Academy of Sciences reviewSeabrook's evacuation plans because of a perception that the NRCfavors the industry it is supposed to regulate. In December, Dolealso asked the NRC to hold up low-power testing until evacuationissues are settled.   ``I'd like to see Senator Dole go a little further, but I'm notknocking what he's done,'' Ehrenberg said. ``He's a tough guy tomove on some issues, that's clear. He's a very careful politician.''   What irks the anti-Seabrook activists is Dole's insistence thatgovernors should not have veto power over nuclear plants. But in aninterview this month, Dole also said a governor ``has got to becertain that the rights of his people are protected.''   On the Democratic side, Dukakis is fighting in federal courtagainst an NRC rule change that would allow approval of evacuationplans developed by utilities when governments balk. Dukakis triedto reinforce his standing with anti-Seabrook voters last week byholding a news conference with the reactor in the background.   Ehrenberg speculated that Dukakis' action against Seabrook mayhave gained him some early organizational support in neighboringNew Hampshire, but that hasn't stopped the other Democrats fromwooing the anti-Seabrook vote _ in some cases, in spite ofgenerally pro-nuclear records.   Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt said he served on thepresidential commission that investigated the 1979 Three MileIsland accident and recommended the evacuation-planning rules thathave become Seabrook's major obstacle.   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart said he sat on a congressionalpanel that helped write those recommendations law.   Jesse Jackson favors a rapid phase-out of all the nation'snuclear power plants and notes that he opposed Seabrook in his 1984preidential campaign, before the Chernobyl disaster in the SovietUnion.   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois calls Seabrook a ``white elephant''that should not operate, and he held a news conference last week inthe same place Dukakis did to criticize pro-nuclear votes by Rep.Richard Gephardt of Missouri.   Simon noted that a nuclear industry lobbying group said lastyear that Gephardt voted with the industry 53 percent of the timein recent years. But Gephardt says his votes came under a morevigilant NRC and he has learned since Chernobyl.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee voted with the nuclearindustry 55 percent of the time when he was in the House, but hastaken a low-key position on problems at the Tennessee ValleyAuthority nuclear reactors.   Clouthier, the New Hampshire voter who is a quality-controlmanager, said he doesn't see Seabrook as an overriding issue in theprimary.   ``But I think they're all avoiding it like a hot potato becauseit is so controversial,'' Clouthier said.</TEXT></DOC>
