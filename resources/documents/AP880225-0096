Jerry Falwell against Hustlermagazine has dashed a legal argument that could have stifledpolitical satire, constitutional lawyers say.   The unanimous decision Wednesday held that even pornographicparodies about public figures are protected by the First Amendmentas long as the satire could not be reasonably interpreted asfactual.   The decision was greeted with relief by First Amendmentspecialists.   ``I've been telling my class, if that one makes it, we're introuble, the First Amendment is in serious difficulty,'' saidProfessor C. Thomas Dienes of the George Washington UniversityNational Law Center.   Falwell had successfully argued in lower courts that he hadsuffered emotional distress as a result of an ad parody inHustler's November 1983 and March 1984 issues. The``advertisement'' had a photograph of Falwell and purportedlyquoted him discussing a sexual encounter with his mother anddescribing himself as a habitual drunkard. At the bottom in smallprint, readers were told that the ad was ``not to be takenseriously.''   The jury in the original Falwell suit found that there was nolibel, but awarded Falwell $200,000 after finding the magazineparody had intentionally caused him emotional distress.   Falwell stood by his arguments Wednesday.   ``I fully appreciate the deep concerns the court has shown forthe sacredness of the First Amendement,'' Falwell said in astatement. ``However, I respectfully disagree with their ruling.Just as no person may scream ``Fire!'' in a crowded theater whenthere is no fire, and find cover under the First Amendment,likewise, no sleaze-merchant like (Hustler publisher) Larry Flyntshould be able to use the First Amendment as an excuse formaliciously and dishonestly attacking public figures as he has sooften done.   ``I believe the Supreme Court has given the green light to LarryFlynt and his ilk to print what they wish about any public figureat any time with no fear of reprisal.''   But First Amendment lawyers said Falwell's claim of distress asthe basis for a libel judgment invited such chaos in the libelfield that even such Supreme Court justices as William Rehnquistand Antonin Scalia, not considered steadfast supporters of pressrights, could not accept it.   The high court also rejected Falwell's claim that the parody waslibelous because of its ``outrageousness.''   ``The concept of outrageousness is so ambiguous that it is justnot viable as a basis for First Amendment standards,'' said Dienes.``If they allowed that, it would have opened an incredible amountof litigation against the media. Just imagine the number ofparodies that cause humiliation, embarrassment.''   Don Gillmor, director of the University of Minnesota's SilhaCenter for the Study of Media Ethics and Law, said the language inFalwell's argument actually dates back to an 1897 case in England,Wilkinson vs. Downston, which held that a statement could belibelous if it was ``extreme and outrageous exceeding allreasonable bounds of decency, leading to emotional distress that issevere and is intentionally reckless.''   Gillmor said the high court apparently rejected that theorybecause it ``opened up indefinition, confusion and even judicialchaos, and (the Supreme Court) just didn't want to deal with it.Even if they didn't like the press protections, this doctrine wasjust too complex an alternative.''   ``I think rough-and-tumble should be the rule,'' said A.E. DickHoward, a University of Virginia law professor. ``I think theopinion is right on.''</TEXT></DOC>
