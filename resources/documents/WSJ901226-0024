The case of AST Research Inc. suggests otherwise.</LP><TEXT>   While high-tech mergers are back in the news with AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s attempt to take over NCR Corp.,and with a raft of aging computer concerns retrenching, someyounger computer manufacturers are growing rapidly, reapingthe rewards of building relatively inexpensive computersaround standard designs and powerful microprocessors.   The performance of AST, an up-and-down company that latelyhas hit its stride, illustrates why the ranks of computermakers will probably remain thick for some years. The companyis a textbook case of how to build market share quickly bydeveloping a variety of computers that blend the latestme-too features with appealing variations, then pricing themaggressively.   AST's growth, meanwhile, suggests that InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and CompaqComputer Corp. may not have the elite segment of the personalcomputer industry to themselves forever.   &quot;AST has pulled away from the pack of second-tier&quot;personal computer companies and, in some corporate accounts,is challenging the top trio, said Andrew Neff, an analyst atBear, Stearns andamp; Co.   Indeed, AST said last week that earnings for its fiscalsecond quarter ending Dec. 28 will nearly double, exceedingexpectations and driving the stock up 21% to close at $32 ashare, a 52-week high. AST stock closed Monday at $33.50,down 25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.   It isn't likely AST can find a home in the top ranks ofthe PC industry any time soon. Its future depends on thereception given various new computers. And the company hasstumbled in the past, posting a loss less than two years ago.Yet AST seems to have shed its image as a &quot;clone maker,&quot; apejorative reference to those bare-bones PC suppliers whomerely knock off the most popular features of brandnamemakers and sell them cheap.   AST has won the business of many large purchasers of PCsthrough a string of skillful moves such as the following:   -- It introduced in July 1989 a line of PCs withreplaceable microprocessors, allowing customers to benefitfrom improvements in processing speeds without discardingtheir entire machine. The feature is such a hit that evenrivals such as IBM are adopting it.   -- It began selling in Japan this fall a machinecompatible with NEC Corp.'s personal computer, whichdominates Japan's market but is incompatible with the IBM PC.Some observers consider AST's effort the most ambitious byany U.S. concern competing in Japan's tough PC market.   -- It introduced in October a PC powered by Intel Corp.'stop 486 chip for $4,000, less than half the price ofcomparable machines from IBM and Compaq.   -- It unveiled last month its first notebook computer,with features similar to Compaq's model but at a price taghalf the size. Neither Apple nor IBM offer notebook models atall.   By such steps, &quot;AST has demonstrated they are not a clonecompany; they are an engineering firm with the resources toproduce quality products,&quot; said William O'Kelly, aninformation manager for Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures unit,which has bought hundreds of AST models in the past 18months.   AST opened it doors 10 years ago, the brainchild of threeimmigrant engineers who saw a chance to make a fortuneselling add-ons to IBM's original PC. The company beganmaking devices that connected the PC to mainframe andminicomputers, then in 1983 hit it big with a product calledSixPakPlus, which expanded the number of peripherals thatcould plug into the PC and increased its memory, allowingusers to run larger programs on their machines. Over the nextthree years, AST's revenues went from $12.7 million to $138.6million.   But just before the add-on business began to deterioratebecause IBM and others started shipping PCs with greateramounts of memory and more slots for peripherals, AST optedto build its own PCs.   &quot;We realized the writing was on the wall (for add-oncompanies) and that we were vulnerable,&quot; said Albert Wong, acofounder who left the company two years ago. &quot;We knew we hadto go into (PCs) or face the consequences of slowing growth.&quot;   The company got off to a strong start, offering PCs withIntel's lastest microprocessor and &quot;matching Compaq (thepacesetter among IBM-compatibles) machine for machine,&quot; saidStewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter.   But AST stumbled in late 1988 because of an initialfailure to match a new Compaq feature and because of coststied to its departure from much of its board business. Forits fiscal year ended June 30, 1989, it posted its first lossand laid off 6% of its work force.   The reversal caused soul-searching among AST's threefounders. Mr. Wong departed, leaving the company in the handsof its other two founders, Safi Qureshey and Thomas Yuen.Rather than continue trying to match Compaq stride forstride, Mr. Qureshey and Mr. Yuen decided to launch a newproduct line that would allow customers to simply plug in thelatest, fastest microprocessor while retaining the rest oftheir machine.   The move was a hit with customers and the new line helpedAST hold down costs, another key to its current strength.Executives now boast that the company can undercut pricessignificantly on IBM and Compaq machines because its costsare low.   Indeed, AST's spending could be too low in some areas. Inits latest complete fiscal year, ended June 30, AST spent amere $18.4 million on research and development, or 3.4% ofrevenue. But while many other computer makers spend twice, oreven three times as much, AST appears to be getting plentyfor its money.   AST has hit some snags along the way. In April, thecompany won kudos for planning an assault on the heart ofJapan's PC market. It had designed a machine compatible withthose sold by market-leader NEC and planned to sell it underthe brand name of a major Japanese electronics concern suchas Sharp. Eight months later, AST still intends to compete inJapan with its products, but powerful Japanese companies haveshunned it and now AST must peddle its wares using its own,largely unknown label.   According to Mr. Yuen, AST's greatest strength lies in itsties to a cadre of sophisticated computer resellers in theU.S. While most other second-tier PC makers have left theirfortunes in the hands of traditional storefront retailers,AST gets a hefty slice of its sales from so-calledvalue-added resellers, which often are chosen to outfitcorporations with PCs.   That tie-in puts AST in position to exploit the weaknessesof such ailing minicomputer makers as Wang Laboratories Inc.and Data General Corp. Networks of PCs are increasinglyreplacing older minicomputers that support a number of dumbterminals. As that shift occurs, resellers who havespecialized in minicomputers are scrambling to adopt PCmakers.   Still, AST almost lost the loyalty of its value-addedresellers a few years back. &quot;In 1987-88, we made some majorblunders&quot; by slighting smaller dealers in a misguided bid towin points with major retail chains, Mr. Yuen said.   &quot;A lot of (retailers) told us they could make us,&quot; addedMr. Qureshey. &quot;You don't build a company that way.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
