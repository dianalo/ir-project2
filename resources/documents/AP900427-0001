(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Connecticut Senate on Friday approveda bill guaranteeing a woman's right to choose abortion even if theU.S. Supreme Court overturns its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decisionlegalizing abortion.   The bill effectively codifies into state law much of Roe vs.Wade, making Connecticut the first state to take such action. Itnow goes to Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, who has said hewill sign it.   ``Even if the Supreme Court were to reverse Roe v. Wade ... thisstatute would be the governing standard for the state ofConnecticut,'' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Democraticvice-chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a co-sponsor of thebill.   ``I think what the Supreme Court is saying in effect to thestates ... is we're going to turn this issue over to you.Connecticut has taken the gauntlet and said we're ready to facethat issue and we're going to be pro-choice,'' he said.   The legislature was spurred to address the issue in part becauseof last summer's Supreme Court decision in Webster vs. ReproductiveHealth Services of Missouri, which gave states greater latitude torestrict abortion.   The measure, which also repeals the state's unenforcedanti-abortion statutes, requires girls 15 and under to getcounseling before an abortion and encourages them to tell theirparents.   Because the bill contains the counseling provisions, thePro-Life Council of Connecticut as well as pro-choice activistshave claimed victory with its approval.   A similar bill approved by the New Hampshire legislature wasvetoed earlier this year by Gov. Judd Gregg, and an effort tooverride the veto failed last week.   Proponents argued the New Hampshire measure merely wrote intostate law the guidelines of Roe vs. Wade. But Judd said the measurewould have gone farther, allowing abortions until the point awoman's doctor determined the fetus could survive outside the womb.   The Connecticut bill, in a slight variation on the Roe vs. Wadedecision, allows abortions late in pregnancy _ when the fetus iscapable of living outside the womb _ only when the life or healthof the mother is in danger.   ``Now that we've placed Roe vs. Wade in Connecticut's law books,we need to fight hard to protect it,'' said Betsy Wacker of theConnecticut branch of the National Abortion Rights Action League,which lobbied for portions of the bill.   A NARAL statement said last summer's Supreme Court decision``sounded an alarm which woke up the pro-choice majority.''   The Senate vote came after about 45 minutes of debate and waswitnessed by numerous House members, who had endured five hours ofdebate on the bill last week.   The Senate easily rejected three Republican amendments, one ofwhich would have restored criminal sanctions against anyoneperforming an abortion and permitted the father or grandparent ofthe fetus to sue for $10,000 in damages. That was rejected 31-4.   Another amendment, rejected 27-8, would have required minors tonotify parents before an abortion could be performed. The bill asapproved requires girls 15 and under to get counseling before anabortion; but it only encourages them to talk with their parentsbeforehand.   ``It's a sad day in the state of Connecticut when we wouldintervene to deny parents' fundamental rights,'' said Sen. ThomasScott, Republican sponsor of the parental notification amendment.Allowing a child to make such a decision on her own, Scott added,``is unconscionable.''   But Sen. Lee Scarpetti, also a Republican, said that ``all thelaws in the world won't change'' family relationships.</TEXT></DOC>
