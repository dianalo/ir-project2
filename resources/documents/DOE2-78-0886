It was found that the addition of small amounts of ZrO/sub2/ improves their magnetic properties to a great extent. Magnetic lossesat 10MHz decreased by a factor two with no significant change in permeabilitywhereas the flexural strength of the material can be improved by thesame factor two while adding 0.5 wt% of dopant. It is hypothesized thatthe microstructural changes, and, consequently, the change in the electricalconductivity influence the magnetic losses. The interface changes allowthe explanation of mechanical properties improvements.</TEXT></DOC>
