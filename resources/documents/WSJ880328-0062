Red tape and bickering within state governments over which agencies will receive the federal funds may hurt the programs that could best boost immigrants' chances for permanent legalization, some activists and public officials fear.    Without well-funded educational programs, for example, immigrants who have qualified for temporary residency under the 1986 law still may see their dreams of staying in the U.S. vanish.    In addition, state officials, who have had to design spending programs to satisfy the sometimes vague federal guidelines concede the allocations are for a phantom population whose characteristics and needs are only now beginning to come into focus.    While praising the efforts of some state officials, many social workers and activists fear immigrants' long-term assimilation needs may be ignored. They worry that too many congressmen and state legislators see the federal funds more as a sop to chronically overburdened local governments than as a way to ease immigrants into society.    &quot;Congress wanted to pass the bill, and they weren't thinking about implementation,&quot; says Arnold Torres, a Sacramento, Calif., consultant who is advising various service providers on the federal grants. &quot;A lot of people reluctantly went along with it. They aren't thinking about how to put (the immigrants) in a position to compete once the funds are gone.&quot;    So far, slightly more than one million people have applied under the general-amnesty program, and another 326,000 under a special agricultural-worker program. Those who qualify for temporary residency have 18 months to apply for permanent legal status, which requires that they pass English-proficiency and civics tests or prove they are studying to do so.    California, which accounts for more than half of all the applicants, stands to receive about 55% of the $3.4 billion available to the states during the next four years. Texas will get about 13% of the grants, followed by Florida with 7% and Illinois and New York with about 5% each.    California officials already are fighting about how the state's share will be apportioned, and other states are watching closely to see if California's proposals will be challenged by the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency overseeing the grants.    &quot;It's a problem Congress set up for the states to fight over,&quot; says Eliza May of the American Public Welfare Association, a group of state human-service officials that is working with the government on the program. She says that if programs to get immigrants into the mainstream of society aren't sufficient, &quot;these will be our second-generation casework people.&quot;    Federal guidelines recommend that the states allocate at least 10% of the money to the categories of health, welfare and education, with the remaining 70% to be divided as the states see fit. The problem, critics say, is that it means most of the funds will be allocated based on political or bureaucratic strength rather than on the true needs of the immigrants.    In California, for example, an ongoing and unrelated feud between the governor's office and the state Department of Education contributed to that agency being allocated only about 9% of the total funding under an initial budget proposal. Following some closed-door wrangling, education will now get about 20%, or $351 million, mostly for administering English and civics courses to help applicants qualify for permanent residency.    &quot;Initially, there was a big fight&quot; that was only partly won, concedes Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction. The department has put off its crusade for even more funding to concentrate on getting the first wave of adult-education courses under way.    &quot;This really is urgent,&quot; Mr. Honig says. &quot;If they don't get past a certain level of performance, these people may become subject to deportation.&quot;    In California, 75% of the state's projected $1.74 billion allocation is earmarked for public assistance, with public health accounting for the remaining 5%. Advocacy groups contend that educational funding is getting short shrift.    &quot;It's not enough to even meet the current need for ESL (English as a Second Language) classes,&quot; says Michael J. Zamba, an administrator with the National Association of Latino Elected Officials. &quot;And many of these people who applied for amnesty are illiterate in their own languages.&quot;    Clearly, the clock already is ticking for the immigrants. &quot;In the (existing) naturalization program, 30% fail the test or withdraw from the program,&quot; Mr. Zamba says. &quot;If that happens in the legalization program, these people will revert to their illegal status. Then what's happened to all the money that was spent?&quot;    The majority of amnesty applicants are Latino, and administrators say Latino adults have traditionally shied away from participating in adult-education and other programs. School districts and other agencies will be reimbursed for each applicant they serve.    One dilemma of welfare agencies is whether to fund benefits that could end up jeopardizing an immigrant's chance for permanent residency. The law requires applicants to prove they're economically self-sufficient, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service considers some forms of state aid evidence that a person would become a public charge. Thus, immigrants may be disqualified for legalization for accepting funds designed to help them.    Officials say they are aware of the paradoxes and loopholes. They also note that the states' funding proposals haven't been approved. They say they expect constant adjustments in the program at the state and federal levels.    The deadline for submitting state proposals to the federal government has been extended to May 16 from April 1; some officials say they don't expect the grants to begin rolling into state coffers until July. In California, legislators are scrambling to pass measures to provide emergency funding and otherwise patch over problems left unaddressed by the general guidelines.    A major stumbling block for service providers is a lack of information on the numbers and needs of the amnesty applicants, who have spent years as an invisible community.    &quot;When it comes to what the population needs, I'm the first guy to admit that the allocations are going to change,&quot; says Mark Helmar, a senior official in California's health and welfare agency, which is overseeing the program. &quot;A lot of what we have now is guesswork, but it'll get easier when we get experience.&quot;    ---                      Amnesty Applicants                     As of March 4, 1988    California               55.1%            740,700    Texas                    13.3             179,100    Florida                   6.7              90,200    Illinois                  5.5              73,500    New York                  5.2              70,500    Arizona                   2.2              29,900    Note: Numbers combine the general amnesty and seasonal agricultural worker programs and are rounded to the nearest hundredth    Source: INS</TEXT></DOC>
