The United States, Japan, France, and Denmark have imposedsanctions ranging from trade embargoes to refusing to extend loans,and many foreign corporations have sold off their South Africaninterests.   South African companies looking to expand or move outside thecountry may be particularly attracted to Britain, because of PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher's steadfast opposition to sanctions.   But if the case of mining giant Minorco SA is any indication,South African companies that make publicly disclosed offers arelikely to face growing resistance from the courts and regulators aswell as anti-apartheid campaigners.   The British government has delayed the firm's $4.7 billion bidfor Consolidated Gold Fields PLC pending a monopoly review. Othercountries have also thrown up roadblocks.   South African companies are nonetheless intent on protectingtheir financial interests. They ``can see day in and day out thatthe turmoil of what they describe as the worst kind comes closer andcloser,'' said Brian Bolton, an England-based writer on SouthAfrican topics who supports the anti-apartheid movement.   ``At some stage they have to act,'' Bolton said. ``What thatmeans at some point is putting up the shutters and hoping they haveput away enough overseas to keep them in the style to which they areaccustomed.''   South Africa's Rembrandt Group Ltd., a major tobacco and consumerproducts company controlled by the wealthy Rupert family, elected inSeptember to spin off its Richemont Group of non-South Africaninterests.   Richemont has listed its shares on Swiss stock exchanges and ithas no operational ties to South Africa, but still is effectivelycontrolled by the Ruperts.   The Ruperts say they want to establish a presence in Europebefore 1992, when the European Economic Community becomes a single,barrier-free trading bloc.   In a telephone interview, Jan du Plessis, Richemont's financedirector in Zug, Switzerland, also cited South African governmentrestrictions, which made it difficult to raise funds publicly, aswell as the impracticality of having headquarters far away in SouthAfrica.   Other South African companies setting up footholds abroad include:   _Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd., an insurance group,which recently set up First International Trust in Europe.   _FSI Corporation Ltd., an industrial group that holds AAFInvestment Corp. in London.   _Malbak Ltd.'s Abercom, which recently bid for MY Holdings PLC, aBritish sporting goods and games manufacturer.   Unlike some smaller deals, Minorco's bid has attracted unusualattention because it would link two of the world's largest goldmining groups in what would be the largest ever takeover in Britain.   Minorco is a Luxembourg-based investment company controlled bythe wealthy South African Oppenheimer family's Anglo American goldand De Beers diamond mining interests. It describes its hostile bidfor Consolidated Gold Fields as part of a strategy to become aworldwide natural resources group with direct operating control ofits activities.   But aside from raising monopoly questions, the bid has sparked arow over the extension of South African control to gold productionin the United States and the Pacific region.   Nearly 45 percent of the non-communist world's gold production of1,361.7 metric tons in 1987 was mined in South Africa, according toShearson Lehman Hutton Securities in London.   Minorco is now 60 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. and DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd. Although that would drop to 41 percentafter the takeover, with shareholders owning the remainder, analystssay even a 41 percent holding assures Anglo American and De Beerseffective control.   Minorco says that if the bid succeeds, it would sell ConsolidatedGold Fields' South African interests, namely its 38 percent stake inGold Fields South Africa, which accounts for 15 percent of thetarget's pre-tax profits. Consolidated Gold Fields also controls49.7 percent of U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp.   The British government blocked the bid on Oct. 25 for up to threemonths by referring it to its Monopolies and Mergers Commission toinvestigate its effect on the public interest, particularly oncompetition in strategic metals of titanium and zircon.   In addition, the federal judge in New York issued a preliminaryinjunction against the deal on the grounds it would reducecompetition in the world gold market.   Elsewhere, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Rabbie Namaliu, haswarned he would require Minorco to divest itself of ConsolidatedGold Fields' Papua New Guinea interests, saying: ``We cannot allowthis apartheid regime to benefit from our rich resources.''   Consolidated Gold Fields has lobbied the White House to block thedeal for national security reasons, raising concerns about SouthAfrican control of the supply of metals.   ``Minorco is South African-controlled and this would inflictgreat damage on our operating companies,'' Rudolph Agnew, chairmanof Consolidated Gold Fields, told the annual shareholders' meetingin early November.   Minorco countered in a letter to President Reagan thatConsolidated Gold Fields was engaging in ``lurid rhetoric''intending ``to smear Minorco with the taint of apartheid and therepressive policies of the present South African government.''   With South African interests of its own, Consolidated Gold Fieldshas attracted criticism from some of its own shareholders.   South African industrialist Harry Oppenheimer told the SundayTelegraph: ``I find it unbelievable to be attacked on the grounds ofSouth African connections, particularly by a group which has beenvery active in South Africa and which certainly has not been in theforefront of opposition to apartheid policy.''   Minorco has indicated a willingness to sell pieces ofConsolidated Gold Fields to satisfy regulatory concerns.   However, Chris Pearson, an analyst with the London investmentfirm Smith New Court Ltd. pointed out that because of objections indifferent countries, Minorco might be asked to sell off a number ofpieces of the target.   ``What are they really going to be left with at the end of theday?'' Pearson asked.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
