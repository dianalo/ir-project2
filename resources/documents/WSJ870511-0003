It marks the first time the Chicago-based carrier has allowed Airbus to make a serious sales pitch.    &quot;United has tended to buy American,&quot; said one source close to the company. &quot;In the past, senior management consistently refused to talk to (Airbus). The fact that they are (talking) today is significant.&quot;    United, a unit of Allegis Corp., began informal talks nearly a year ago with its usual suppliers -- Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. -- for as many as 40 wide-body aircraft, sources said. These planes would replace the 17 long-haul airplanes United inherited in late 1985 when it bought Pan American World Airway's Pacific division, and would meet expected growth in that market.    But a few months ago, sources said, United broadened the talks to include the possible purchase of as few as 50 and as many as 150 short-range aircraft for its domestic routes. These aircraft would replace some of the carrier's 154 Boeing 727s and expand its short-haul domestic fleet.    The major engine and aircraft makers are being asked to make &quot;package&quot; offers to meet both requirements, sources said.    &quot;This could be one of the biggest overall fleet buys ever,&quot; one source said. &quot;But we don't know whether this will be one big sale or several split sales. United is talking to everybody.&quot;    A United spokesman said the company doesn't comment on such matters. United's senior executive in charge of fleet planning wasn't immediately available for comment.    The three aircraft makers would confirm only that they are involved in &quot;sales campaigns&quot; with United. Industry sources stressed the talks haven't reached the stage of formal negotiations, and that no decision is expected from United until at least the fall.    Three-way competition can only serve to benefit United. Industry sources speculated that Airbus's entry in the talks is United's way of stepping up pressure on the U.S. manufacturers, particularly Boeing, to sweeten their offers.    The European consortium, which is trying to build up its market in the U.S., is known to offer lower prices and more generous finance and contract terms on important sales.    But it is also possible the recent pressures on United -- including a bid by the pilots' union to buy the airline, talk of possible takeovers of Allegis, a financial loss in the first quarter and shareholder dissatisfaction with Allegis's long-term strategy -- are forcing the airline to look twice at Airbus's offers, said one source close to the airline.    It is believed that in the initial stage of these talks, United is looking at a combination of 747 jumbos or long-range 767s and small 737s from Boeing; a package of McDonnell Douglas's new MD-11 long-haul trijets, and perhaps its small MD-80s; and finally, from Airbus, a mix of the Europeans' new 150-seat A-320 and the A-340, a 280-seat long-distance jetliner now in the planning stage.    But it is entirely possible United would break up the order between aircraft makers. American Airlines, an AMR Corp. subsidiary, did that recently when it ordered Airbus and Boeing planes.    United is a big Boeing customer; its most recent order, in late 1985, was for as many as 110 Boeing 737s and six 747s for a total of $3 billion.    But the carrier has only exercised its orders for 41 of the 110 planes. The remaining 69 aircraft could be exchanged for other Boeing models, a spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing said. Ostensibly, they also could be counted in any new transaction.    McDonnell Douglas confirmed that it is pitching its new MD-11 wide-body to United, but a spokeswoman in Long Beach, Calif., said she wasn't familiar with any discussions over the company's small MD-80 aircraft.    Airbus would say only that it is trying to win United as a customer.    &quot;The fact that Airbus may have a chance with United is a big plus&quot; for the consortium, said one European insider. But he and others speculated Airbus may be trying to heighten this impression in order to win the government funding it needs to go forward with its new aircraft projects for the 1990s.    As previously reported, the consortium is awaiting decisions from the governments of France, West Germany and Britain about whether to award it more than $3 billion in subsidies. The money would cover the bulk of the development costs of building the long-range A-340 and a shorter range sister aircraft, the A-330.    Funding decisions are expected later this month or next month.    Airbus consists of Aerospatiale of France, Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., British Aerospace PLC and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A.    If United did break with the past and place an order with Airbus, longstanding trade tensions between the U.S. and the European community over civil aircraft sales and subsidies probably would escalate, a U.S. trade specialist said.    But with U.S. engine manufacturers and subcontractors likely to benefit from those Airbus sales, the issue wouldn't be clear-cut. </TEXT></DOC>
