Take a look at municipal bonds.    For investors in high tax brackets, many munis offer yields equivalent to 10% or more, when the value of these bonds' tax-exempt status is taken into account.    &quot;If people have been waiting and have missed a lot of the rate declines this year, then this is an especially attractive time to consider buying munis,&quot; says Neal Attermann, vice president and manager of municipal research at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    That's because yields on municipals haven't fallen as much in recent months as those on taxable securities such as Treasury bonds. &quot;It really makes sense for high-tax bracket investors to select municipals right now instead of Treasurys,&quot; says Marshall B. Front, executive vice president at Stein Roe andamp; Farnham Inc., a Chicago-based investment-counseling firm.    Some of the highest yields now are on long-term municipal revenue bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the municipality issuing the securities, revenue bonds are backed by the revenue generated by the bridges, airports and other special facilities they are sold to finance.    The yield on a group of 25 revenue bonds compiled by the Bond Buyer, a trade publication, now stands at 7.39%. For an investor in the 33% federal income tax bracket, 7.39% tax-free is the same as earning 11.03% on a taxable investment. That's a taxable-equivalent yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.    While not all municipal bonds offer double-digit taxable-equivalent yields, they can still be very attractive compared with yields on taxable investments. For investors in the 33% bracket, some three-year general obligation municipals now offer about one percentage point more than three-year Treasurys do, after adjusting for federal taxes, according to calculations by Stein Roe.    The one area where muni yields don't offer a clear advantage for high-bracket investors is money market mutual funds. Returns on taxable funds beat those on tax-exempt funds after adjusting for federal income taxes.    Even with money funds, however, munis may have the edge for some investors when state and local income taxes are considered. But investors in high-tax states, such as New York or California, may find it advantageous to keep their money in single-state municipal bond money funds, which are free from all federal, state and local income taxes for in-state investors.    Muni specialists say municipal bond yields are likely to hold steady or possibly increase slightly in coming weeks, even if Treasury bond yields drop further. The reason is a large wave of new municipal issues that will soon hit the market.    All this new financing &quot;should slightly raise yields, thereby increasing the attractiveness of municipal bonds,&quot; says S.E. Canaday Jr., vice president at John Nuveen andamp; Co.    Municipal bond yields haven't fallen as fast as those on Treasurys for several reasons. The risk that a municipal bond may be called, or redeemed, before its stated maturity is one important factor.    While most Treasury issues can't be redeemed before their final maturity date, municipals usually don't have such &quot;call protection.&quot; Moreover, even veteran bond traders sometimes have trouble understanding the complex provisions in municipal bond offerings that spell out the circumstances under which the bonds may be called.    This is particularly important at a time when interest rates are declining. It is in times of falling rates that issuers call their high-yielding bonds, typically replacing them with new, lower-yielding securities as a way to reduce their borrowing costs. The market demands a bit higher yield to compensate for this call risk.    Concern about the economy is another factor. Signs of slower economic growth this summer sent many investors rushing to buy Treasury issues for safety and liquidity reasons. In addition, interest on Treasury issues isn't subject to state and local income taxes.    The municipal market has been hurt by reduced purchases by property and casualty insurance companies and by an increase in the volume of new issues.    Municipal bond specialists advise investors buying munis to concentrate on high-quality issues and to stay away from lower-rated bonds. That's because the difference in yields between high and low-quality munis is relatively small. &quot;So you're not getting adequately compensated for buying lower-quality paper,&quot; says Donna Avedisian, vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    In addition, with the economy slowing and some forecasters even predicting a recession, &quot;some of the weaker credits might experience some stress,&quot; says Ms. Avedisian. &quot;So investors should pay a lot of attention to quality.&quot; Calculating the taxable-equivalent yield on municipal bonds is easy, once investors know their &quot;marginal tax rate.&quot; That's the rate that applies to a taxpayer's last dollar of income.    To find the taxable equivalent yield on a tax-exempt investment, simply divide the municipal bond yield by one minus your marginal tax rate. For example, an investor in the 33% bracket would divide the municipal bond yield by 0.67. </TEXT></DOC>
