O'Boyle@  Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 08/31/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><DATELINE> BONN  </DATELINE><TEXT>   West Germany is bracing for the possible influx of thousands of additional East German refugees who are expected to pass through the Austro-Hungarian border this weekend.    West German government spokesman Hans Klein confirmed yesterday that Bonn was preparing for the &quot;rapid, sudden arrival of a very large number&quot; of East German refugees in the next few days. Earlier, West German press reports had said that Hungary will soon allow thousands of vacationing East Germans to leave that country, breaking a diplomatic standoff between the two German states over how to deal with the vacationers.    Mr. Klein declined to estimate how many additional refugees Bonn was anticipating. But diplomatic sources estimate that perhaps as many as 10% of the 150,000 East Germans vacationing in Hungary will seek passage to the West. An estimated 6,000 East German citizens have fled through Hungary since May, when the Hungarian government, in an unprecedented move, dismantled the barbed wire that marked its border with the West.    In all, East Germany is expected to lose at least 100,000 citizens this year as people flee a nation whose leaders continue to resist the democratic reforms introduced throughout much of the Soviet bloc.    The tide of refugees, who under West German law are eligible for automatic citizenship, has forced Bonn to open up new processing camps to handle the overflow. To prepare for the latest influx, Mr. Klein said Bonn had requested that the state government in Bavaria prepare four additional tent camps there, each of which would handle 1,000 refugees.    For most of this summer, Bonn and East Berlin have been locked in a diplomatic standoff over how to resolve the crisis. Diplomatic sources say, however, that the impasse probably will be broken this weekend, mainly through the intervention of the Hungarian government. Because most of the vacation visas expire this weekend with the resumption of school in East Germany, those citizens wishing to emigrate will be forced to either return to their country or cross through the loosely controlled Austro-Hungarian border. Once the vacationers have left the country, East Germany is expected to impose tougher restrictions to limit the number of its citizens traveling to Hungary.    Just how the new influx of East Germans might pass to the West is unclear. The exodus has put the Hungarian government in a bind.    Although it wants to avoid mass defections to keep from further angering East Berlin, it also has pledged not to force the East Germans to go home.    In an effort to find a compromise, Hungarian Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth and his foreign minister, Gyula Horn, flew to Bonn last Friday for four hours of private talks with senior West German officials. The Hungarian government yesterday issued a statement denying that it was opening its borders to all East German citizens who want to emigrate.    But Bonn officials are apparently convinced that while Budapest might not be prepared to issue exit visas, it may instruct its border guards to look the other way when emigres seek passage.    Meanwhile, the exodus has confronted the East German regime, led by its ailing and unyielding leader Erich Honecker, with a crisis unparalleled since the building of the Berlin Wall. Mr. Honecker, who as security chief presided over the wall's construction in 1961, heads a ruling Politburo that is dominated by old, conservative and sickly men.    Mr. Honecker himself has been hospitalized twice this summer with a gallbladder ailment and wasn't seen publicly on his 77th birthday last Friday. The Associated Press, quoting West German security officials, reported yesterday that a gallbladder operation on Mr. Honecker had failed, indicating that he remains seriously ill. The communist leader won't attend the Leipzig trade fair, opening Sunday, as had been his custom, East German government sources said yesterday. Two high-ranking deputies, Willi Stoph and Guenter Mittag, were also said to be sick and unable to attend the fair. Mr. Honecker's prolonged absence has contributed to the impression of a government unable to cope with the crisis. </TEXT></DOC>
