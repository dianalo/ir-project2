London shares closed mixed after asluggish day.</LP><TEXT>   In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index dropped through the23000-point level as selling pressure from margin calls wentuncontested on the first day of a traditional summer holidayweek in Japan. Though selling across all sectors was light,the lack of buying amplified the effect.   The Nikkei, which slipped 47.84 on Friday, plummeted448.95 points to 22985.67.   In trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei rose 97.26 pointsto close the morning session at 23082.93.   On Monday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst-section issues, which fell 10.45 points Friday, lost28.64, or 1.59%, to 1776.17. First-section volume wasestimated at 180 million shares, compared with 178.3 millionshares in the previous session. Losers swamped winners,896-70.   The majority of stock-market participants had gone onvacation for this week's &quot;obon&quot; festivals in Japan. Thoughfundamental factors hadn't changed, with Japanese currencyand bond markets generally steady, stocks fell sharply astechnical selling pressures were triggered. Meanwhile, buyingsentiment continued to sour because of stock and bankingscandals as well as poor corporate earnings outlooks. In theafternoon session, selling picked up, linked to unwinding ofmargin positions. More than one trillion yen ($7.32 billion)of margin positions face margin calls this month and nextmonth, and concern is growing that many investors will eitherliquidate other shareholdings, to raise cash for additionalcollateral, or sell their margin positions.   In London, share prices finished at intraday peaks, thoughlittle stimulus emerged to spur the market in any firmdirection. And with the Bundesbank council meeting Thursday,traders in London weren't staking out any big positions, incase the German central bank decides to boost interest rates.London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index lost1.2 points to 2569.4. The FT 30-share index added 2.0 pointsto 2007.5. Turnover was 280.7 million shares, compared with421.4 million the previous session.   In Frankfurt, the DAX index fell 6.15 points to 1626.06.Market participants don't expect major stock-price swingsbefore the Bundesbank council meeting, and the effects of apotential German rate increase already have been built intomost stock prices in Frankfurt. Still, the central bank'sscheduled meeting kept activity light on most Europeanbourses, which posted declines or ended mixed.   Across Asia, stocks tumbled. Sydney shares fell 1.2%,their third consecutive decline. Wellington prices were off1.3% on weaker trends in New York Friday and in Tokyo andAustralia Monday. Seoul registered a 2.2% drop. Singapore'smain index sank 1.5%. Taipei shares weakened on profit-takingand on government plans to tax stock dealings ofinstitutional investors. Among the bigger Asian bourses, onlyHong Kong gained, propelled by a cut late Friday in bankdeposit rates and the halt in rumor-driven bank runs that hitthe colony last week.   Among corporate developments, in London, Pearson fell 12pence, or 1.6%, to 750 pence ($12.71). The publisher'sfirst-half pretax profit dropped 58% to #40.5 million ($68.6million), under pressure from weak consumer spending andlower advertising revenue at its newspaper operations. Theresult was slightly below analysts' expectations. Pearsonsaid that most of its annual earnings are generated in thesecond half because of the seasonality of its book, finechina and entertainment operations. The company said it willkeep its interim dividend unchanged at 10.75 pence a share.   Standard Chartered Bank dropped 8, or 2.1%, to 372.Unsubstantiated rumors in Hong Kong last week caused a briefrun on the bank's operations in the colony, where aninitiative was begun to try to restore confidence in thebanking sector.   British Telecommunications rose 1 to 383 in heavy trading,with more than one million shares changing hands. Britain'sTreasury unveiled a plan to give discounts to those who buyshares in the government's November sale of part of its stakein British Telecom, the former state telecommunicationsmonopoly. Terms of the offering, which is expected to raiseabout #5 billion, weren't disclosed.   In Paris, Lafarge-Coppee slipped 2 French francs to 336francs ($57.11).
