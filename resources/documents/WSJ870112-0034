The securities firm hopes that the operations up for sale will fetch a price in excess of $800 million.    PaineWebber, which led last month's leveraged buyout of the car rental concern, said it is seeking a buyer for National's Lend Lease car leasing and truck renting and leasing operations. Those operations had estimated billings last year of $360 million and pre-tax operating profit of $57 million.    Billings, a larger sum than the revenue entered on the books, represent the amount of money that customers send in.    Lend Lease accounts for about one-third of National's revenue but more than half of pre-tax, pre-interest profit.    The PaineWebber group acquired National Car Rental for $459 million and the assumption of more than $1 billion in debt.    PaineWebber said it decided that the leasing business had less room for improvement than the rental businesses being retained. &quot;It's a good operation,&quot; a company spokesman said, and an opportune time to sell because of the lower cost of money and because of consolidation in the industry.    In a statement, Vincent A. Wasik, National chief executive officer, said that selling the Lend Lease businesses &quot;will enable us to achieve maximum value for our investors, while permitting us to concentrate on operating the National car rental business.&quot;    The car leasing operation leases fleets to corporations from 14 locations in the U.S. and Canada. It has 55,418 cars, estimated 1988 billings of $219.4 million and pre-tax operating profit of $38.3 million. The truck sector rents and leases trucks from 65 locations in the U.S. There are 8,790 trucks in its fleet, with estimated 1986 billings of $140.9 million and operating profit of $18.8 million.    PaineWebber, a subsidiary of PaineWebber Inc., acquired National in a leveraged buyout with an investment group including Fidelco Capital Group, a private investment company based in Milburn, N.J., and Ardshiel Inc., a private investment banking concern in New York. In a leveraged buyout, an acquisition is financed largely with borrowed funds, which are repaid with cash generated by continuing businesses or by selling assets. </TEXT></DOC>
