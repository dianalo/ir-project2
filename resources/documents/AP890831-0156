(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An unusual mix of Ivy Leaguers andwestern cowboys, the band of volunteers who formed the Army's WorldWar II mountain division, holds a unique place in American militaryand skiing history.   More than 44 years after their victories, the veterans of the10th Mountain Division still get together regularly to reminisce andenjoy the fellowship of the men they once fought against.   ``The division's record was most phenomenal _ never defeated,never pushed back,'' said Earl E. Clark, a retired Denverbusinessman and founder of the 10th Mountain Division Associationholding a reunion here this week.   ``It was something that happened once in our military history,''he said. ``After the war, the German commanders labeled the 10thDivision the elite unit of the U.S. Army.''   The division was the only American unit of infantry-divisionstrength ever trained specifically for high altitude and coldweather fighting.   ``You had quite a conglomeration _ men from Dartmouth, Williams,Princeton and Yale, because that's where the skiing was, and Montanacattle ranchers,'' said Clark.   Made up of skiers, mountain climbers and survival experts _supported by a group of cowboys, mule skinners and blacksmiths _ the10th captured key German strongholds in the Apennine Mountains innorthern Italy in early 1945. That paved the way for the finalAllied thrust into the Po River Valley and the Dolomite Mountains.   Inspiration for the division came from Finland's ski troops in1939, Clark said. Russian invaders ``were literally stopped for thewinter by a very small unit of men on skis,'' said Clark. ``That wasa graphic example of how a skilled unit of men on skis could stop aninvasion force.''   Finding skilled skiers wasn't easy.   ``There weren't many in the United States at that time,'' saidClark, who still skis at age 70. ``There were more skiers at Vail(Colo.) during Christmas week than there were in the United Statesin 1939.''   Veterans of the division helped create the nation's post-war skiindustry.   The division, which had 14,000 troops at one point, was sent inmid-1944 to fight its way up the mountains of northern Italy.   More than 2,000 mules carrying supplies and howitzers accompaniedthe division, which took heavy casualties, with 992 men killed andmore than 4,100 wounded.   Many members of the division were also first-generation Austrianand German immigrants, who had been given the option of fighting theJapanese rather than having to face soldiers from their oldcountries, said Clark.   The white ski suits, cold weather tents and mountain skis thedivision used are on display this week at the division's reunion.   ``You'd be soaking in sweat if you were in one of those tents andit wasn't 20 below,'' said Felix Church of Seattle, a rock-climbingspecialist who lost his left leg in combat and won the Silver andBronze stars and the Purple Heart.   The 10th veterans also have forged ties with mountain fightersfrom West Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Japan. Participantsfrom those countries were in southern Indiana this week and will beat the International Federation of Mountain Soliders congress thatstarts Friday in Vail.   ``There's very little refighting of the war that goes on atthese,'' said Clark.   ``In addition to the war experience, you had another great lovethat binds us all together _ the love of the mountains.''</TEXT></DOC>
