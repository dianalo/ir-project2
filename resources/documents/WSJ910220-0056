Consumers feeling squeezed often forgo brand loyalty andare less willing to pay premium prices for the products theyusually prefer. So companies will crank out millions morecoupons as they &quot;scramble to compete in a shrinkingmarketplace,&quot; predicts a new study by D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp;Bowles, a New York-based ad agency.   But there's a downside. D'Arcy says couponing already mayhave become too much of a good thing. Redemptions have hit aplateau in recent years, perhaps due to market saturation. In1989, the latest year for which figures are available,manufacturers distributed an estimated 267.6 billion coupons-- or 2,910 per household -- with a total potential savingsof nearly $132 billion. The average coupon face value rose to49.2 cents. Still, less than 3% of the coupons were redeemed.   The typical coupon shopper, according to the study, is amiddle-aged married working white woman who has a householdincome of $29,000 and who knocks $6 off her weekly $74grocery bill by using coupons. Lower-income families aren'texposed to as many coupons, the study says, in part becausethe vast majority of coupons are distributed throughnewspapers and magazines and such families spend less thanaverage for reading materials.   D'Arcy says that among coupon clippers' greatestsatisfaction is the belief they're somehow &quot;beating thesystem.&quot; Others say using coupons relieve the boredom ofshopping by creating a game-like situation.                                                                                                          Supermarkets Increase   Share of Retail Sales                                                                                                          THE ONE-STOP shopping concept is paying off for thenation's supermarkets.   With their delis and druggists, photo developers andfloral departments, big supermarkets put nearly 21% of allconsumer retail dollars in their tills in the first half of1990. That was one percentage point higher than in 1988, saysNielsen Marketing Research.   Some of this increase reflects food inflation, but Nielsenreports that the convenience of the one-stop store has helpedreverse a decline in food stores' share of retail salesduring the 1980s.   Nielsen's latest review of the U.S. supermarket industrysays the average shopper spends $94 a year on health andbeauty aids and $60 on general merchandise at the same storewhere the shopper buys groceries.   In other findings, Nielsen says more consumers areshunning generic items in favor of branded goods. In thefirst quarter of 1990, generic sales fell 15% from theyear-earlier period -- which in turn was 12% lower than the1988 first quarter, the research firm says.   In-store product displays remain powerful merchandisemovers, the study found. Supermarkets average about two dozendisplays a week, according to the report. Soft drinks get themost prominent space, followed by cookies, potato chips andother snacks, cereals and paper towels. And more than a thirdof the nation's large grocery outlets have a live lobstertank.   Supermarkets still favor newspapers as their primaryadvertising medium. But Nielsen predicts direct mail willbecome popular as stores learn how to apply all the salesdata they are gathering with their checkout scanners.                                                                                                          Just the Facts, Ma'am --   But Skip the Fax                                                                                                          NEWSPAPERS that publish abbreviated facsimile editionsfind that most readers are content to wait for the realthing.   At one time, more than a half-dozen morning papers in theU.S. were experimenting with afternoon summaries of the news,which they faxed to subscribers wanting a sneak preview ofthe next day's news. Now, like earlier ventures intoelectronic newspapering, most fax editions have beenunplugged.   The News-Sentinel, Knoxville, Tenn., killed its faxedition last October after six months. &quot;It was a luxury item&quot;that a few chief executives at local firms took for a while,a spokesman says.   Fax editions typically go heavy on business news -- thoughthey don't run stock prices. A spokeswoman for theMinneapolis Star Tribune, which folded its effort inDecember, says, &quot;Readers preferred to wait for completeinformation in the morning&quot; paper.   Others that have pulled out recently include the ChicagoTribune, which had hoped to sell Tribfax subscriptions for$400 a year. Fax papers can cost four times as much as aregular newspaper, and publishers found few advertiserswilling to help defray production costs.   But a few newspapers press on. The New York Times sends afacsimile paper of six to eight pages to Japan, Caribbeancruise ships and the Saudi Arabian war front -- all areaswhere its regular daily product isn't available.   The Hartford Courant finds a limited but loyal audiencefor its fax sheet, especially at local businesses. &quot;We use itas an early-warning notification about news of the company orof the opposition,&quot; says a spokesman for Travelers Corp.,Hartford, Conn.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          WORD-OF-MOUTH works. When the two Germanys reunited, somany East Germans bought multipack boxes of its chewing gumthat Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. reported a wad of extra profits.&quot;Our advertising obviously got across the Iron Curtain,&quot; aWrigley spokesman says, adding that the company now isputting up billboards in the former East Germany. . . .
