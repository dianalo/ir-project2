From 1979 to 1983, the FMP was amended annually.In 1984, a framework amendment to the FMP was implemented which provideda mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments in the regulationswithout annual FMP amendments (49 FR 43679, October 31, 1984). Amendmentsto the framework FMP were also implemented in 1987 and 1988. Development of Amendment 9 began in September 1987 when a ``scoping session''was held by the Council. Subsequent Council discussions identified sixissues requiring further analyses and possible modifications to the FMP.A draft amendment was prepared and distributed to interested persons forreview on October 14, 1988. Comments were invited, and five public hearingswere held on November 2 and 3, 1988 (53 FR 41222, October 20, 1988).After considering the comments received on the draft amendment at publichearings and Council meetings, and from its Salmon Technical Team (STT),Salmon Advisory Subpanel, Scientific and Statistical Committee, and EnforcementConsultants, the Council made its final selection of preferred alternativesfor the amendment at its November 16-18, 1988 meeting in Portland, Oregon.The Council selected non-status quo alternatives for the six issues.The major purposes of Amendment 9 are to (1) replace the long-term spawningescapement goal and rebuilding schedule for Klamath River fall chinookwith fixed annual spawning escapement and harvest rates which will allowa fixed percentage from each brood of natural spawners to escape the fisheriesand spawn, subject to a minimum escapement floor for naturally spawningadults; (2) modify the ocean harvest allocation of coho and chinook betweennon-Indian commercial and recreational fisheries north of Cape Falcon,Oregon; (3) revise the coastwide notice procedures for inseason managementactions; (4) conform Federal and State regulations regarding the incidentalharvest of steelhead by recreational fishermen; (5) authorize inseasonreporting requirements for commercial fishermen to provide timely accountingof catches from any regulatory area subject to quota management; and (6)remove the limitations on commercial and recreational season beginningand ending dates. These issues, their impacts, and the rationale for theCouncil's recommended changes are summarized below.Amendment Issue 1_Klamath River Fall Chinook Escapement GoalThis part of the amendment replaces the current escapement goal for KlamathRiver fall chinook established in 1984 by the framework FMP. The currentescapement goal begins with an interim rebuilding schedule to increaseocean escapements and culminates in a long-term spawning escapement goalby 1998 of 97,500 naturally spawning adults and 17,500 hatchery adults.The amendment would establish fixed annual spawning escapement and harvestrates which will allow a fixed percentage of the potential adults fromeach brood of natural spawners to escape the fisheries and spawn, subjectto a minimum spawning escapement floor for naturally spawning adults. Thus,the optimum spawning escapement goal, expressed as a fixed spawning escapementrate, will be determined by the annual productivity of the stock. The annualharvest, expressed as a fixed harvest rate, is expected to approximatemaximum sustainable yield (MSY) over the long term.A number of concerns regarding the appropriateness of the current long-termspawning escapement goal and rebuilding schedule have been raised in recentyears. The current long-term spawning escapement goal was based on estimatesof spawning escapement in the early 1960s and was first adopted by theCouncil in 1978. Parties seeking a larger harvest argue that the productivityof the Klamath River basin may have been reduced since the early 1960sby habitat degradation, and that placing larger numbers of spawners inthe river will not increase the future production of chinook from the river.They offer as evidence the fact that run sizes decreased in the early 1980sdespite greatly reduced ocean fisheries. Others point to the lack of spawningchinook in areas of the basin with apparently good habitat which formerlysupported chinook as evidence that there needs to be an increase in spawningescapement. They argue that the current long-range spawning escapementgoal may not be sufficiently large to produce MSY from this resource.Interim escapement goals for Klamath River fall chinook are currently expressedin the rebuilding schedule as ocean escapement levels to the mouth of theriver. Under the framework FMP, a specific spawning escapement goal isnot provided for until after 1998. The framework FMP states that spawningescapement goals will be set when ocean and in-river allocations are agreedupon. Beginning in 1986, ocean and in-river harvest allocations have beennegotiated. A permanent negotiating forum consisting of harvesters andmanagers of Klamath River fall chinook now exists, the Klamath FisheryManagement Council (KFMC). The KFMC was established under the Klamath andTrinity River Basins Restoration Act (Pub. L. 99-552) to, among other things,establish a long-term plan and policy for managing the ocean and in-riverharvest of Klamath River salmon, and recommend ocean harvesting regulationsto the Council. (The KFMC was preceded by the Klamath River Salmon ManagementGroup (KRSMG) which was formed in 1985 under the auspices of the PacificFishery Management Council.)The current stock rebuilding schedule relies on an increase of 20 percentin average ocean escapement every four years until the long-term goal isachieved between 1994 and 1998. When ocean escapements are well above therequired rebuilding level during any four-year period, the framework FMPallows escapement for the remaining years in that period to be reducedto a level which may be below that necessary to maintain minimal production.Therefore, the current rebuilding schedule does not adequately preventpotential underescapement and subsequent harm to the resource. Amendment 9 addresses all these concerns. It establishes fixed spawningescapement and harvest rates to provide optimum spawning escapement basedon stock productivity and harvests which will better achieve MSY. Implementingharvest and escapement rates, rather than a fixed escapement level, allowsthe magnitude of landings and escapement to vary in proportion to stockabundance. This reduces the possibility of having complete fishing closuresin any one year. At the same time it allows for natural variation in thespawning escapement to provide information or productivity from which toassess optimum spawning escapement and ultimately determine a more appropriatefixed spawning escapement goal. The amendment also establishes a spawningescapement floor for naturally spawning adults to prevent extremely lowspawning escapements in any one year which might lead to extended periodsof depressed natural production and failure to meet hatchery escapementneeds.This management approach was developed by the Klamath River Technical Team(KRTT), the KRSMG, and the KFMC, and was used during the 1986-1988 oceansalmon fishery seasons. The Council adopted initial spawning escapementand harvest rate percentages based on the 1986 recommendation of the KRSMG(i.e., a 35 percent natural spawning escapement rate and a 65 percent harvestrate for each brood (year class) of fish). These specific rates are basedon the best available assessment of the measurable biological parametersfor the stock and the selectivities of the ocean and in-river fisheriesacting upon it. The Council intends that Klamath River fall chinook bemanaged as a unit wherever they may be in the ocean. Therefore, the spawningescapement and harvest rates are overall rates which apply over the entirerange of the stock. However, harvest rates on Klamath River fall chinookstocks may differ greatly between geographic areas as long as the overallharvest rate does not exceed 65 percent.Under Amendment 9, the STT may consider annually information on the appropriatenessof the 35 percent natural spawning escapement rate goal and provide itsdetermination to the Council before preseason management options are developed.Upon recommendation of the STT and approval by the Council, the recommendationto change the spawning escapement and harvest rates will be forwarded tothe Secretary for implementation under existing procedures. The proceduresfor modifying escapement goals are described in the framework FMP and theimplementing regulations (50 CFR 661.22 and Appendix section IV.B.)  The amendment also provides a framework within which compatible harvestallocations can be determined. However, it does not establish harvest ratesfor specific fisheries and, thus, does not allocate the resource betweenuser groups. The harvest allocations negotiated by the users groups arepart of the Klamath River Salmon Management Long-Term Harvest Sharing Agreementsigned by KFMC members in July 1987.  The Council adopted a minimum escapement floor of 35,000 naturally spawningadults as recommended by the KRTT. This decision was based, in part onthe fact that a 35,000 fish floor was a higher escapement level than forany year since 1978, and was about 30 percent higher than the 1979-85 averageescapement of 26,800. The STT considered the 35,000 fish floor to be toolow and recommended an escapement floor of 43,000 naturally spawning adultsbased upon their analysis of two stock recruitment curves and the judgmentof biologists regarding the spawning capacity of individual spawning areas.The KRTT responded by questioning the spawning capacity of an area withouttaking into account the interaction of juvenile chinook salmon in mainstem rearing areas. Furthermore, the KRTT expressed little confidence inthe stock recruitment curves developed by the California Department ofFish and Game and relied on by the STT.  The Council considered the contradictory recommendations of both the KRTTand STT and adopted the 35,000 fish floor because it provides a level ofprotection for natural spawners at very low levels of production that ishigher than during the 1976-85 period, and prevents additional hardshipsto fishermen that would result from foregoing additional harvests at the43,000 fish floor. The Council concurred with the KRTT in its conclusionthat additional spawners from a 43,000 fish floor would not greatly assistthe achievement of significantly higher escapement levels. Major improvementsin escapement will most likely occur as a function of improved juvenilesurvival.  The KRTT tested the effectiveness of the 35,000 fish floor by modelinga 40-year time series of data which included three consecutive years ofpoor recruitment. The resulting yield to the fishery was about 17 percentgreater than the floor in place than in the absence of a floor. Thus, theCouncil concluded that the requirement for a 35,000 fish floor will protectspawning escapement in years of low production while at the same time improvinglong-term yield to the fishery. The 35,000 fish floor is also expectedto protect sufficient numbers of hatchery fish to meet hatchery productionneeds in most years. Any subsequent modification of the spawning escapementfloor must be by FMP amendment.  The fishery model upon which the Klamath River natural spawning escapementrate is based will be continually under review as new information on thestock and the fisheries become available. The parameters of the model willbe reviewed by the KRTT, the STT, and the Council's Scientific and StatisticalCommittee. Changes in the model parameters may be approved by the Council,based on the best scientific information available. As productivity measurementsbecome available for a wide range of escapement levels of naturally spawningadults, the ultimate objective is to derive the optimum spawning escapementgoal, expressed as a fixed spawning escapement level or a fixed spawningescapement rate, and to incorporate it into the framework FMP by the amendmentprocess.  Amendment Issue 2_Harvest Allocation of Non-Indian Fisheries North of CapeFalcon, Oregon  This part of the amendment modifies the ocean harvest allocation of cohoand chinook salmon between non-Indian commercial and recreational fisheriesnorth of Cape Falcon, Oregon, originally established in 1984 by the frameworkFMP. Specifically, it changes the current allocation schedule to increasethe number of salmon allocated to recreational fishermen at all levelsof coho and at low levels of chinook salmon abundance; establishes clearallocation objectives for the Council to follow; provides greater flexibilityto deviate from the allocation schedule, if necessary, to achieve the Council'sobjectives more effectively; and establishes allocation priorities to guidethe Council's actions when recommending such deviations.  For the past three years, the Council has recommended harvest allocationsfor the non-Indian commercial and recreational ocean salmon fisheries northof Cape Falcon which have deviated from the framework FMP's allocationschedule. The Secretary has implemented these recommendations each yearby emergency rule.  Significantly reduced allowable harvests for both commercial and recreationalfisheries since the mid-1980's have greatly shortened seasons, resultingin negative socio-economic impacts within the coastal communities whichdepend on the recreational and commercial fishing industries. Recent totalallowable ocean harvest quotas have been consistently below those anticipatedat the time the framework salmon FMP amendment was proposed and approved.At these chronic low stock abundance levels, the present allocation scheduleestablishes allowable commercial and recreational harvest quotas whichhave not provided for the fisheries most beneficial for both the commercialand recreational users.The current allocation schedule has resulted in extremely short recreationalseasons which have been particularly damaging to local community businesseswhich depend on attracting recreational fishermen from many different geographicalareas. Not only have recreational fishing seasons been extremely short,but they have been continually disrupted by numerous inseason regulatorychanges in an effort to achieve more closely full utilization of the remainingcoho and chinook salmon quotas. Both of these factors have made it difficultfor coastal communities to attract and sustain large numbers of charterand private boat fishermen and have significantly reduced community income.The Council believes that determination of the base recreational allocationwhich provides more stablility to the local communities is an inappropriatedetermination to make annually during the Council's short preseason process.Thus, the Council has proposed a new long-term allocation schedule whichreflects the Council's emphasis on increased stability for the recreationalfishery.  The failure of the present allocation schedule has (1) required extensivepreseason transfers of fish and emergency action to achieve more optimalcommercial and recreational fisheries; (2) contributed to the inseasonloss of significant percentages of allowable harvest by both commercialand recreational fisheries, resulting in failure to attain fully the optimumyield (OY); (3) required extensive use of inseason management changes,particularly in the recreational fishery, to try to achieve reasonableseason length and more fully utilize available harvests; and (4) exacerbatednegative socio-economic impacts of the reduced seasons on local communities. Not only have the allowable harvests been greatly and consistently reducedin recent years, but large percentages of the allowable harvests have goneunharvested, due in some part to the limited flexibility in the allocationschedule of the framework amendment. In 1986, the commercial fishery harvestedonly 76 percent of its chinook quota and 85 percent of its coho quota.In 1987, the commercial fishery exceeded its chinook quota by 9 percentbut was only able to harvest 43 percent of its coho quota, forfeiting over80,000 coho. The 1986 recreational fishery harvested 103 percent of itscoho quota while landing 84 percent of the chinook quota. In 1987, therecreational fishery was unable to harvest 26 percent of its coho quotawhile landing 100 percent of its chinook quota.  There are several reasons for the reduced non-Indian ocean salmon fisheriesnorth of Cape Falcon. Certain weak chinook and coho salmon stocks havelimited the ocean harvest rate in recent years. Other constraints and adjustmentsunder the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty, Treaty Indian and non-Indianallocations requirements under <T3>U.S.</T3> v. <T3>Washington</T3> and <T3>Hoh Indian Tribe</T3> v. <T3>Baldrige</T3>, and inside/outside sharing have all had a part in theharvest changes. Managers and users are working with these issues on anannual and long-term basis to assure increased allowable harvests for thefuture. However, significant increases in available non-Indian ocean harvestare not likely for some years. The present total allowable ocean harvestis simply not sufficient to provide more than near minimal needs of therecreational and commercial fisheries. Modifying the present allocationschedule to allow more flexibility for commercial and recreational userswill not resolve this problem, but it is expected to allow for more efficientuse of the available harvest quotas for both fisheries. It should alsosignificantly reduce the need for annual emergency regulations.  The problem of incompletely harvesting quotas results from the tremendousfishing power of the commercial fishery, the unpredictability of its harvestpotential in one- and two-day seasons, the variability in relative chinookand coho abundance, and the inflexibility of the present allocation scheduleregarding fish which may be transferred between commercial and recreationalfisheries both preseason and inseason. Coho and chinook are caught concurrentlyin this area and fishermen have only limited ability to target on one specieswithout impacting the other. When the quota of one species is taken, thefishery must close for both species. The present allocation does not allowfor adjusting quotas inseason between recreational and commercial fisheriesto take advantage of possible variations in species harvest rates betweenthe two fisheries. Therefore, both fisheries may be closed with a considerableportion of quota unharvested. The limited inseason management measures,such as area closures and recreational bag limit changes, which have beenimplemented to correct for imbalance in quota attainment have been largelyineffective. They have served only to increase confusion and dissatisfactionamong fishermen.  In April 1987, the Council asked the States of Oregon and Washington toreview the harvest allocation schedule north of Cape Falcon. Beginningwith a user group meeting in October 1987, followed by numerous meetingsand extensive discussions among fishery representatives making up the Northof Cape Falcon Allocation Work Group, this process resulted in the allocationalternatives presented to the Council.  In January 1988, the Council requested the Secretary to modify the allocationschedule by emergency regulation (53 FR 8234, March 14, 1988). The Secretarydenied the Council's request and recommended that the Council pursue implementationthrough the FMP amendment process (53 FR 19771, June 1, 1988). In April1988, the Council requested the Secretary to implement a modified allocationfor the 1988 fishing season which again deviated from the current allocationschedule. The Secretary approved the request and the 1988 regulations werepublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 4, 1988 (53 FR 16002).   The proposed new allocation schedule is the result of the information andexperience gained during the Council's review process. In adopting theamendment, the Council is recommending overall allocation objectives, amodified harvest allocation schedule, more flexibility to deviate fromthe harvest allocation schedule by preseason and inseason trades and transfersof chinook and coho salmon between fisheries, and fishery allocation prioritiesto guide the Council's actions when it deviates from the allocation schedule.The Council believes an increase in the recreational harvest allocationfor chinook and coho salmon is required to achieve OY north of Cape Falcon.Overall allocation objectives recommended by the Council are as follows:(1) Provide recreational opportunity by maximizing the duration of thefishing season, while minimizing daily and area closures, gear restrictions,and daily bag limits; and (2) maximize the value of the commercial harvestwhile providing fisheries of reasonable duration.Initial allocations each year will be based on the revised allocation schedule.This schedule provides to the recreational fishery an increased coho allocationat all levels of total allowable coho harvest and an increased chinookallocation at levels below a total allowable harvest of about 150,000 chinook.At current low levels of total allowable coho and chinook harvests, theincrease in the recreational allocation will increase recreational seasonlength while maintaining a portion of the available harvest for the commercialfishery.Because the rate at which the recreational fishery utilizes its quotasis much slower than the commercial fishery, the number of coho harvestedby the commercial fishery in one day may provide a week or more of recreationalfishing. The transfer to the recreational allocation will thereby resultin an extension of the overall period of fishing activity. This shouldgenerally distribute the economic benefits to local communities over alonger period of time, resulting in more economic stability in those localcommunities. While the transfer to the recreational fishery is a directloss to the commercial fishery, a portion of that loss is offset by theability and historic practice of some commercial fishermen to move to otherfishing areas. Although recreational fishermen also can relocate theirfishing effort to some extent, many local community businesses which dependon recreational fishing seasons for peak summer income are not able torelocate. Also, the greater recreational chinook allocation will allowfor a longer season through a chinook-only recreational fishery in yearsof low allowable coho harvest. Having these factors built into the allocationschedule, rather than depend on preseason trades, provides additional assuranceto local communities for the base recreational seasons that can by expected.This should further benefit the social, cultural and economic stabilityof the region and reduce annual uncertainty over the duration of recreationalseasons.Preseason and inseason deviations from the revised schedule which establishfinal allocations will be guided by the following fishery allocation priorities.(1) At total allowable harvest levels up to 300,000 coho and 100,000 chinook,provide coho for the recreational fishery for a late June through earlySeptember all-species season; provide chinook to allow access to coho and,if possible, a minimal chinook-only fishery prior to the all-species season;and adjust days per week and/or institute area restrictions to stabilizeseason duration. For the commercial fishery, provide chinook for a Mayand early June chinook season and provide coho for hooking mortality and/oraccess to a pink salmon fishery, and ensure that part of the chinook seasonwill occur after June 1. (2) At total allowable harvest levels above 300,000coho and above 100,000 chinook, relax any restrictions for the recreationalfishery in the all-species fishery and/or extend the all-species seasonbeyond Labor Day as coho quota allows; provide chinook for a Memorial Daythrough late June chinook-only fishery; and adjust days per week to ensurecontinuity with the all-species season. For the commercial fishery, providecoho for an all-species season in late summer and/or access to a pink salmonfishery; and leave adequate chinook from the May through June season toallow access to coho.To increase the likelihood that both fisheries catch their allowable harvests,preseason and inseason species trades will be allowed using the exchangeratio of four coho to one chinook as a guideline, but not a specific constraint.Inseason transfers between the commercial and recreational fishery quotaswill allow fish deemed ``uncatchable'' in one fishery to be reallocatedto the other fishery. Such actions will require consultation with usergroup representatives before implementation.This part of the amendment decreases the commercial share of coho froma range of 31 to 69 percent under the present allocation to a range of25 to about 55 percent (the percent increases as coho abundance increases).For chinook, the amendment changes the commercial share from a range of54 to 63 percent under the present allocation (the percent increases ascoho abundance decreases). The amendment reallocates coho and chinook primarilyto assure more stable recreational seasons at moderate to low total allowableharvest levels. The primary negative impacts of this reallocation are (1)a greater probability of no commercial all-species season rather than theone- or two-day seasons which may occur under the present allocation whencommercial quotas are in excess of 30,000 coho, and (2) a decrease in thecommercial chinook quota primarily at low allowable harvest levels of bothchinook and coho. The reallocation under the amendment diminishes, butdoes not eliminate, the commercial fishery. Conversely, it enhances therecreational fishery, but still leaves it at levels well below the historialaverages. Only a significant increase in total allowable harvest northof Cape Falcon will allow aboth commercial and recreational fisheries toapproach average historical seasons.The overall benefits from the amendment are primarily the result of gainsin the recreational sector exceeding losses to the commercial sector. Modifyingthe framework allocation schedule will not resolve the problem of reducedallowable ocean harvest levels, but it is intended to allow for more productiveuse of the available harvest for both commercial and recreational fisheries.Therefore, the Council adopted this alternative as the best approach tomeeting its allocation objectives for each fishery while improving theoverall socio-economic impacts of the ocean fisheries on local communities.Amendment Issue 3_Inseason Notice ProceduresThis part of the amendment revises the notice procedures for inseason managementactions. Specifically, inseason actions taken under both fixed and flexibleinseason management provisions may be effective and enforceable by announcementin designated information sources before a notice is filed for public inspectionwith the Office of the Federal Register (OFR).Current federal salmon regulations require that notice of inseason actionsbe filed with the OFR prior to becoming effective. This requirement hasresulted in logistical problems when management decisions are made latein the day and insufficient time exists to file a notice with the OFR thesame day, or if it becomes necessary to take action when the OFR is closed,e.g., during a three-day holiday weekend.Two primary problems have resulted from delayed implementation of inseasonactions. First, quotas have been overharvested if fishery closures cannotbe made effective at the time quotas are projected to be achieved. Quotashave also been underharvested. In one instance, delays in implementingadjustments to recreational management measures to slow the harvest ofchinook, which was approaching its quota, caused the chinook quota to bereached and the season to be closed before the majority of the coho quotacould be caught.The second problem is the uncertainty in forecasting when actual filingwith the OFR will occur, which makes it difficult to provide fishermenadequate prior notice of the actual effective time of an action. Becausethe actual time of filing is not known beforehand, announcements of inseasonactions through public media are often made relatively late and are oflimited effectiveness. This increases the possibility that fishermen mayunintentionally violate new regulations and possibly by subject to enforcementaction. Conversely, if NMFS announces an inseason action before the noticeis filed with the OFR, fishermen may be under the mistaken assumption thata legally enforceable action has occurred when it has not.The Council has addressed these problems by recommending that effective,enforceable notice of an inseason management action be provided by makingactual notice of the action available to fishermen. The communication channelsby which actual notice will be given will be specified in the preseasonannual regulations, and will include: (1) Broadcast by the U.S. Coast Guardon the ``Notice to Mariners'' broadcast (VHF Channel 16 will announce theclear channel or frequency over which broadcasts are made); and (2) stateand federal telephone hotline numbers to be specified annually in the preaseasonregulations. Notices of inseason actions will also continue to be filedwith the OFR.Actual notice by means of ``Notice to Mariners'' broadcasts and specifiedhotlines will make inseason changes effective even if they occur priorto filing with the OFR. All the normal channels currently used by stateagencies to inform the public of regulatory changes will also remain inuse.Amendment Issue 4_Steelhead Management IntentThis part of the amendment conforms federal and state regulations on theincidental harvest of steelhead by allowing such harvest by recreationalfishermen while retaining the prohibition against such harvest by commercialfhshermen.The current framework FMP and federal regulations prohibit non-Indian commercialand recreational fishermen from taking and retaining, or possessing, anysteelhead. Current regulations of the States of Washington, Oregon, andCalifornia, however, allow the incidental harvest of steelhead by recreationalfishermen and prohibit such harvest by commercial fishermen.The Council adopted the alternative that makes federal and state regulationsconsistent by allowing legally licensed recreational fishermen, but notcommercial fishermen, to harvest steelhead. Ocean harvest of steelheadin the recreational fisheries off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, andCalifornia is rare, and results in an insignificant impact on the steelheadresource. Because the harvest of steelhead in the ocean is such a rareoccurrence, adoption of this alternative has no measurable impact on eithercommercial or recreational fishermen, but will reduce confusion resultingfrom incompatible federal and state regulations and from recreational fishermenbeing unable to distinguish steelhead from salmon.Amendment Issue 5_Radio Reporting Requirements for Commercial Salmon FishermenThis part of Amendment 9 authorizes inseason radio reporting requirementsfor commercial fishermen to provide timely accounting of catches from anyregulatory area subject to quota management. It involves a collection-of-informationrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act and to OMB review andapproval. A request to collect this information is being submitted to OMBfor approval and the issuance of a control number. Because of the timerequirements associated with OMB's review and approval, this part of theproposed rule will be published separately (as a proposed rule) for publicreview and comment. It is intended that after receiving and consideringpublic comment, the regulatory text will be combined with the rest of thefinal rule when published.Amendment Issue 6_Limitations on Season Beginning and Ending DatesThis part of the amendment removes the current limitations on commercialand recreational season beginning and ending dates.The framework FMP contains five specific prohibitions governing seasonbeginning and ending dates. For example, currently no commercial coho fisherynorth of the Oregon-California border may open prior to July 1. With therecent creation of the Klamath management zone (KMZ) (Orford Reef Red Buoy,Oregon, to Horse Mountain, California) and the development of all-speciesfisheries in the KMZ during June, this prohibition has been an issue inthe Council's preseason process. In 1988, emergency action was requiredto allow a uniform fishery to occur throughout the KMZ in June.Another current prohibition states that no commercial chinook or coho fisherywill extend after October 31. The Council and NMFS have approved commercialand recreational chinook-only fisheries in Oregon state waters (0-3 nauticalmiles off shore) after October 31 to target on abundant local fall chinookstocks and avoid impacts on weak stocks.Given the demonstrated need for more flexibility in shaping seasons, theCouncil recommended removing the specific limitations on season beginningand ending dates. The increasing complexity of management requires morelatitude in setting seasons to avoid impacts on weak stocks, optimize harvestof abundant stocks, and maximize socio-economic benefits.Technical CorrectionsTwo technical changes are implemented by this rule. A typographical errorin the scientific name for steelhead, <T3>Salmo gairdneri, </T3>is corrected. All references to the Salmon PlanDevelopment Team are changed to reflect the group's new name, the SalmonTechnical Team.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>Section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary, upon receivinga fishery management plan or plan amendment prepared by a Council, to makea preliminary evaluation for purposes of deciding if it is consistent withthe national standards and sufficient in scope and substance to warrantreview. The Secretary has decided Amendment 9 does warrant review. Undersection 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Act, the Secretary is to publishproposed regulations by the 15th day after the statutory receipt date forthe amendment. The Secretary has not yet determined that Amendment 9, whichthese regulations would implement, is consistent with the national standards,other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary,in making that determination, will take into account the data, views, andcomments received during the comment period on the proposed rule.The Council prepared an environmental assessment for this amendment whichindicates that there will be no significant impact on the environment asa result of this rule. The environmental assessment has been publishedin a booklet with Amendment 9 and may be obtained from the Council at theaddress listed above.The Under Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere has determined that this proposedrule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis underExecutive Order 12291. This determination was based on analysis of theregulatory impact review (RIR) prepared for this rule which demonstratesthat the rule will not result in (1) an annual major increase in costsor prices for consumers, individual industries, or government agencies;(2) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or (3) significantadverse effect on competition, employment, productivity, innovation, oron the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. This proposed rule, if adopted,will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallbusiness entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thusrequired preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA).The RIR/IRFA may be obtained from the Council at the address listed above.A summary of the economic impacts evaluated in the RIR/IRFA are set forthbelow and all apply to small business entities because this industry consistsonly of small entities.Amendment Issue 1_Klamath River Fall Chinook Escapement GoalUnder the Council-adopted alternative, escapement and harvest rates willallow higher landings when ocean abundance is low compared to the fixedescapement goal. Thus, more year-to-year stability in the fishery is expected.Conversely, escapement and harvest rates will allow lower landings whenocean abundance is high, thus limiting the potential for very large catchesrelative to the status quo. However, given that these rates may be modifiedeach year during the preseason regulation development process, the harvestrate could be increased in a year of particularly high abundance. Sincethe actual capacity of the Klamath River basin is not certain, the frequencythat such high levels of ocean abundance will be achieved is unknown. The35,000 fish minimum spawning escapement cannot be changed except by FMPamendment and thus provides the necessary margin of safety.Amendment Issue 2_Harvest Allocation of Non-Indian Fisheries North of CapeFalcon, OregonBoth alternatives to the status quo show improvement in net economic value(NEV) in most of the relevant ranges of the quotas in addition to negativevalues over different areas of the ranges of quotas considered. Neitheralternative appears to be clearly superior to the other, or to the statusquo, over all areas of the relevant ranges. For the Council-adopted alternative,the estimated changes in NEV over the likely range of harvest levels (50,000to 600,000 coho and 50,000 to 300,000 chinook) are between ^$149,000 and$710,000. Negative values are generally found at combined allowable harvestlevels below 100,000 coho and below 250,000 chinook. However, at theselevels, the assumptions of the analysis are violated by the proposed chinook-onlyrecreational season. The impact of this season would be to increase theNEV's for the Council-adopted alternative over those generated by the analysis,and reduce or eliminate the negative values. The estimated changes in personalincome generated in coastal communities over the likely range of harvestlevels are between ^$47,000 and $1,198,000.Amendment Issue 3_Inseason Notice ProceduresThe Council-adopted alternative could provide positive impacts by allowingmore timely utilization of certain management actions.Amendment Issue 4_Steelhead Management IntentBy reducing confusion over conflicting Federal and State regulations andallowing recreational fishermen to retain steelhead, the impacts of theCouncil-adopted alternative are positive.Amendment Issue 5_Radio Reporting Requirements for Commercial Salmon FishermenThe economic effects of this amendment measure will be summarized in aseparate proposed rule.Amendment Issue 6_Limitations on Season Beginning and Ending DtesAlthough the impacts of the Council-adopted alternative depend on whatactions are taken annually which depart from the current prohibitions,the impacts could be significantly positive by allowing the Council tobe more responsive to annually identified socio-economic needs. In someprevious years, commercial fishermen have argued for earlier seasons totake advantage of better prices.This proposed rule is exempt from the procedures of Executive Order 12291under section 8(a)(2) of that order. Deadlines imposed under the MagnusonAct, as amended by Pub. L. 99-659, require the Secretary to publish thisproposed rule by the 15th day after an FMP amendment is received. The proposedrule is being reported to the Director, Office of Management and Budget,with an explanation of why it is not possible to follow procedures of theorder.The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management programs of the States of Washington, Oregon, and California,and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. NMFShas submitted this determination for review by the responsible state agenciesan the San Francisco Bay Commission under section 307 of the Coastal ZoneManagement Act.This rule does not contain an information collection requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.

For example, fora total allowable ocean harvest of 150,000 chinook, the recreational allocationwould be equal to 50 percent of 100,000 chinook plus 40 percent of 50,000chinook or 50,000+20,000=70,000 chinook.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The initial allocation may be modified annually in accordancewith paragraph (iii) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Total allowable ocean harvest will be maximized to the extentpossible consistent with treaty obligations, State fishery needs, and spawningrequirements. Every effort will be made to establish seasons and gear requirementswhich provide troll and recreational fleets a reasonable opportunity tocatch the available harvest. These may include single-species directedfisheries with landing restrictions for other species.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Fishery allocation priorities. Deviations from the allocationschedule must be structured to achieve, to the extent practicable, thefollowing fishery alloction priorities when establishing final harvestallocations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) At total allowable harvest levels up to 300,000 coho and 100,000chinook: For the recreational fishery, provide coho for a late June throughearly September all-species season; provide chinook to allow access tocoho and, if possible, a minimal chinook-only fishery prior to the all-speciesseason; and adjust days per week and/or institute area restrictions tostabilize season duration. For the commercial fishery, provide chinookfor a May and early June chinook season and provide coho for hooking mortalityand/or access to a pink fishery, and ensure that part of the chinook seasonwill occur after June 1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) At total allowable harvest levels above 300,000 coho and above100,000 chinook: For the recreational fishery, relax any restrictions inthe all-species fishery and/or extend the all-species season beyond LaborDay as coho quota allows; provide chinook for a Memorial Day through lateJune chinook-only fishery; and adjust days per week to ensure continuitywith the all-species season. For the commercial fishery, provide coho foran all-species season in late summer and/or access to a pink fishery; andleave adequate chinook from the May through June season to allow accessto coho.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Allocation flexibility. To provide flexibility to meet the dynamicnature of the fisheries and to be consistent with the fishery allocationpriorities in paragraphs 2(a)(iii) (A) and (B), deviations from the allocationschedule will be allowed as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Preseason species trades (chinook and coho) may be made basedupon the recommendation of the commercial and recreational Salmon AdvisorySubpanel representatives for the area north of Cape Falcon. The socio-economicimpacts of any such recommendation will be compared to those of the standardallocation schedule. This analysis will be made available to the publicduring the preseason process for establishing annual management measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Inseason transfers, including species trades of chinook and coho,may be permitted in either direction between commercial and recreationalfishery quotas to allow for uncatchable fish in one fishery to be reallocatedto the other. Fish will be deemed uncatchable by a respective commercialor recreational fishery only after considering all possible annual managementactions to allow for their harvest which meet fishery allocation prioritiesincluding single species fisheries. Implementation of inseason transferswill require consultation with the pertinent commercial and recreationalSalmon Advisory Subpanel representatives from the area involved and theSalmon Technical Team, and a clear establishment of available fish andimpacts from the transfer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) Preseason trades will use an exchange ratio of four coho to onechinook as a guideline. Inseason trades or transfers may vary from theguideline ratio to meet the fishery allocation priorities in paragraphs2(a)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) The percentages presented in the allocation schedule are averagesfor the entire area between Cape Falcon and the U.S.-Canada border. Thegeographic distribution of the allocation percentages may be varied bymajor subareas, i.e., north of Leadbetter Point and south of LeadbetterPoint, if there is need to do so to protect the weak stocks. Deviationsfrom the overall percentages in each major subarea will generally not exceed50 percent of the allocation of each species which would have been establishedin the absence of the transfer.</ITAG>10.
