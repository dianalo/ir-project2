Now, traders and economists are trying to figure out what kind of message the central banks were attempting to send. And they're still asking themselves: Where's the U.S. Federal Reserve?    Suspicion is growing that major central banks are resigned to a continuing decline of the dollar but are reluctant to acknowledge it. Their major task now, in the view of several analysts, is to see that the U.S. currency's retreat stays orderly.    &quot;Without some sign of a really determined, concerted effort to hold it, (the dollar) is going to go to new lows,&quot; the head of foreign exchange operations for a major U.S. bank said. &quot;The Bank of Japan must accept the inevitability of a stronger yen. The Fed's interest . . . is just to make sure (the dollar) doesn't drop so fast that nobody buys their bonds.&quot;    Friday, the Bank of Japan sold yen to buy dollars in Tokyo trading, as it had been doing all week. Then during European activity, traders said, the West German Bundesbank, Banque de France and Swiss National Bank all intervened to support the dollar when it was trading at 1.8110 to 1.8130 West German marks. Market estimates were that the four central banks combined spent a moderate $400 million to $500 million.    The Bank of Italy also reportedly sold marks to buy Italian lire. The transactions may have been directed mainly at defending the sagging lira in the European Monetary System, in which eight European currencies float within specified limits. But they also had the effect of helping the dollar by increasing the supply of marks in the market.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar was marginally higher at 1.8115 marks and 141.90 Japanese yen, compared with 1.8085 marks and 141.73 yen late Thursday.    As has been the case since the dollar's latest fall began Aug. 14, the Federal Reserve, the U.S.'s central bank, wasn't in the market, according to traders.    There were differing interpretations of the European banks' motives. James T. McGroarty, a vice president at Discount Corp. of New York and a former trader at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said he thinks the central banks were testing the Fed.    Others said the banks were mainly trying to calm the European Monetary System amid growing speculation that the Italian, Danish and Belgian currencies might have to be devalued.    Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said senior European monetary officials are scheduled to meet next week to discuss French proposals for changes in the way the EMS works.    &quot;They want stable exchange rates going into the meetings and probably afterward as well,&quot; he said.    But many analysts suspect that central banks are resigned to the view that persistently high U.S. trade and budget deficits will lead to a lower dollar. Rather than trying to resist the trend, they say, the banks should focus on tempering it.    Friday's interventions &quot;weren't triggered by the level of the dollar, but the speed with which it came down,&quot; David Morrison, chief international economist for Goldman Sachs International Corp. in London, said.    He and other analysts noted that 1.80 marks and 140 yen are psychologically crucial levels.    &quot;Without a preventive strike, the central banks were concerned that if 1.80 or 140 had been broken decisively (last) week, it may have generated a bandwagon&quot; move against the dollar, Mr. Morrison said.    That's what happened in April, when the dollar tumbled through 150 yen and accelerated to 138 yen, while U.S. bond yields increased more than one percentage point. Once markets build momentum against a currency, it becomes expensive, if not impossible, for central banks to stem the tide.    &quot;The central banks are very keen that they still show their responsibility for the market and that they not let the dollar fall too much,&quot; Martin W. Huesner, a senior vice president at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, said. At the same time, he said, &quot;The market needs some room for breathing, and the central banks are prepared to give it.&quot;    Nonetheless, some analysts are puzzled by the lack of comment from U.S. Treasury officials and by the Fed's inactivity.    &quot;Three to six months ago, the only people you heard from in the U.S. were (former Fed Chairman) Paul Volcker and (Treasury Secretary) Jim Baker,&quot; Mr. Morrison said. &quot;Volcker's gone now, and Baker seems to have all but disappeared; he's not said a thing about exchange rates since the Venice (economic) summit in June.&quot;    So now, he said, the central figure is new Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has yet to speak about the dollar &quot;in an official capacity.&quot;    Mr. McGroarty of Discount Corp. said the U.S. silence means Washington &quot;is accepting the gradual depreciation of the dollar.&quot; Although no one in the government wants it to fall sharply, he said, the Reagan administration is eager to ease the protectionist sentiment in Congress that was probably strengthened by last week's report of a record $39.53 billion U.S. second-quarter trade deficit.    Some analysts say there's little danger in a dollar decline as long as foreign capital keeps flowing to the U.S. to finance the budget and trade deficits.    &quot;If we went to 120 or 130 yen, I don't think anyone would disapprove if it were in an orderly fashion and didn't have an adverse impact on stock and bond prices,&quot; Mr. McGroarty said. He said that &quot;the bond market's been OK and the stock market's been great&quot; while the dollar has fallen from record highs in early 1985 to its current levels.    Both Mr. Bianchi of Union Bank in Zurich and Mr. Morrison said the Fed has quietly allowed U.S. interest rates to drift upward to slow the dollar's descent without halting it.    &quot;It's a better way than for the Fed to go in and buy dollars itself,&quot; Mr. Bianchi said. &quot;That would be an official sign the U.S. doesn't want the dollar lower; that's politically difficult right now.&quot;    For the time being, the central banks' tactics might work.    Mr. Bianchi said that despite the bearish market sentiment, &quot;the dollar's potential for going down is less&quot; because of the rise in rates. Mr. Morrison said that in the near term, central banks might manage to keep the dollar above 1.80 marks and 140 yen -- but to do so might require a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, he said.    A big test for them will come when U.S. trade figures for July are released Sept. 11.    Still, traders said, by not indicating strongly that they want to halt the dollar's slide, the central banks risk letting the market drive it down quickly. That could reignite fears of inflation in the U.S., drive up interest rates and make it more difficult to attract foreign capital.    One problem some see with the Fed's seemingly passive stance is that Mr. Greenspan lacks the international credibility of Mr. Volcker.    Moreover, &quot;there's suspicion in the markets that Mr. Greenspan would also like a lower dollar, because that was his expressed view prior to his appointment,&quot; Mr. Morrison said. &quot;So it might be better if he came out and said he doesn't want the dollar to crash.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for September delivery settled at $453.10 an ounce, down $2.30. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    ---                   Late New York Trading                   Friday, Aug. 28, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
