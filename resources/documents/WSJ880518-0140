The combination of the two banks' interests in areas including insurance, oil refining, cement production and construction also will create a powerful new industrial group.    The two banks said they will create a joint holding company, Banco Espanol Central de Credito S.A., that will organize their complete merger within three years. Their combined parent-company assets of 5.4 trillion pesetas ($48.39 billion) at the end of last year would place the new group about 31st among European banks and 70th world-wide.    The new group will surpass the size of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya S.A., which is being formed through the merger of Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya announced in January. The combined parent-company assets of Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya totaled 4.3 trillion pesetas at the end of last year.    Both the government and the central bank have been pressing Spanish banks to modernize and regroup in preparation for the planned dismantling of barriers to trade and capital flows within the European Community by 1992.    The Banco Central-Banesto merger leaves only three major Spanish banks without partners -- Banco Hispano Americano, Banco Santander and Banco Popular. All three so far have resolutely rejected any alliance with other banks. Banco Santander has embarked on a policy of acquisitions to strengthen its international position.    On Madrid's stock exchange yesterday, Banco Central shares closed at 5,725 pesetas ($51.30), up 50 pesetas from Monday, while Banesto shares were unchanged at 5,675 pesetas. </TEXT></DOC>
