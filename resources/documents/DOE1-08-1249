Parts of theprogramme are (1) a 100 kW-solar photovoltaic (PV) hydrogen demonstrationplant in Riyadh, (2) a 10 kW PV-Hydrogen experimental HYSOLAR-house inStuttgart, (3) a 2 kW facility in a Saudi university, and (4) furtherresearch and development in the universities of Stuttgart, Riyadh, Dhahranand Jeddah. A paper with the aforementioned title was given on the occasionof the laying of the foundation stone ceremony of the HYSOLAR-house inStuttgart, 17 December 1986. In 12 theses, the major principles are describedunder which solar hydrogen may become part of the future world energytrade system. Technological, energetic and economic statements are made;advantages and disadvantages of a future hydrogen energy economy areformulated.
