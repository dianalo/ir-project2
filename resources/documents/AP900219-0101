One person was killed and three woundedin two air raids, Lebanese police said.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said its warplanes attackedbases used by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,a Marxist PLO faction, near the village of Kafr Jarah, four mileseast of Sidon.   It said the bases were destroyed and all the aircraft returnedsafely from the first attack, about 35 miles north of Israel'sborder. There was no immediate confirmation from Israel of thesecond attack.   Police said that in the first assault, four Israelifighter-bombers fired eight rockets at the installations. Theguerrillas immediately closed all roads leading to the bases.   Thirty minutes later, a police spokesman said, another formationof Israeli fighter-bombers hit the bases as the guerrillas tried toevacuate their casualties.   The raids brought to six the number of Israeli air strikesagainst guerrilla targets in Lebanon this year. The last was Feb.16 against a Shiite Moslem Amal militia base in al-Hajjah insouthern Lebanon.   The Moscow-oriented Democratic Front and terrorist Abu Nidal'sFatah-Revolutionary Council regularly attack targets in Israel'sself-designated ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.   Israel usually launches air strikes into Lebanon in retaliationfor guerrilla raids.   The army said the Democratic Front was responsible for a seriesof attacks on Israeli troops, including an incident Wednesday inwhich four guerrillas tried to infiltrate into Israel's buffer zonein southern Lebanon. One guerrilla was killed and three captured inthat incident.   The security zone, six to 10 miles deep, was established whenIsrael withdrew the bulk of its army from Lebanon in 1985, threeyears after it invaded. The zone runs east from the Mediterraneancoast to the slopes of Mount Hermon and was designed as a bufferagainst guerrilla raids.</TEXT></DOC>
