The charges against Herbert Zinn Jr., 18, of Chicago, signal the start of &quot;an aggressive position toward computer crimes,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas.    &quot;This is not malicious mischief,&quot; Mr. Valukas said in announcing the federal charges. &quot;It's a felony.&quot;    Mr. Zinn allegedly committed the crimes with the help of his home computer when he was a juvenile, and could be sent to prison until his 21st birthday in August 1991. Mr. Zinn, who was charged in a criminal information, couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    The government also said Mr. Zinn advertised on a computer bulletin board how to electronically break into ATandamp;T's computers.    The federal charges arose after Mr. Zinn was arrested several times, including for allegedly breaking into the computers at the Keller Graduate School of Management and at Commodity Perspective Inc., both in Chicago.    Court documents indicate Mr. Zinn broke into an ATandamp;T computer at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Maintenance and Supply Headquarters in Burlington, N.C., and an ATandamp;T computer at Robins Air Force Base, Ga.    Software taken from NATO and the Air Force base were &quot;low level in terms of sensitivity,&quot; Mr. Valukas said.    Agents raided Mr. Zinn's home after an ATandamp;T security officer logged onto the so-called Phreak Class-2600 computer bulletin board and spotted messages signed by &quot;Shadow Hawk,&quot; a code name the goverment said Mr. Zinn used.    Mr. Zinn also tried to electonically break into computers at the Washington Post's accounts payable department, a hospital in South Bend, Ind.; and computers in Columbus, Ohio; Rye, N.Y.; and Pipe Creek, Texas, the government said.    Mr. Zinn told the Chicago Sun-Times he hasn't pursued his computer techniques &quot;with quite the same vim and vigor&quot; since federal agents raided his home last year. He said he hopes eventually to resume his schooling and become an electronics engineer, the newspaper said. </TEXT></DOC>
