Several cable companies around the country refused to show themovie, transmitted on the Cinemax pay cable network, promptingoutcries of censorship, while others broadcast disclaimersbeforehand.   The movie portrays the life of Jesus Christ and includes scenesof a fantasy Jesus entertains in the movie about being married toMary Magdalen.   Its box-office opening last year was followed by protestsnationwide, with some theaters canceling showings because of bombthreats.   In West Memphis, Ark., about 300 members of eight churches vowedto cancel their cable television subscriptions for six months afterthe movie was shown Monday night on Cinemax.   ``We know there are many other forms of what we would callsinful viewing, but we feel the line must be drawn somewhere,''said the Rev. Gary Hair, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church. ``Weknow that people are free to watch what they want, and by the sametoken we're free to make an appeal. We believe the message ofChrist is being blasphemed.''   Cable companies across the country, including at least three inArkansas and two in Pennsylvania, were blacking out the movie totheir subscribers, but the manager of American Cablevision in WestMemphis said he refused to.   ``One, we believe we're not allowed to censor the programmingunder our contract with Cinemax; and, two, a basic First Amendmentreason _ we might not agree with what the movie has to say, butwe're not going to censor it because one element of the communityasks us to.''   Officials Home Box Office, the parent company of Cinemax, saidthey would have no comment on the controversy.   Some of the protests were against the cable companies' decisionnot to show the movie.   In Jonesboro, Ark., more than 30 people carried signs that``Stand Up Against Censorship'' as they marched outside EastArkansas Cablevision. man confused over his identity and purpose,and subject to sexual temptation.   In Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Service Electric displayed a message on ablue screen: ``The management of Service Electric have decided notcarry this film because of strong content objections voiced byvarious groups when the movie was initially released to theaters.We do not believe it is responsible to offer a movie, even on apaid channel, which was not generally shown in general theatersbecause of sensitive content.''   ``I went to Vietnam to fight against this kind of thing,'' saidRichard Tattersall of Wilkes-Barre. ``I came home and was taking myboots off to go to bed when I switched on the TV. I don't even wantto watch the thing; I'm just angry they're censoring it.''   A 73-year-old Oklahoma man has sued Multimedia Cablevision for$1 million for allegedly violating his constitutional rights bypre-empting the movie.   ``I'm a World War II veteran, and I treasure our Constitutionand all the provisions of it, and I say if we don't protect it thenwe deserve to lose it,'' Felix Olim said.</TEXT></DOC>
