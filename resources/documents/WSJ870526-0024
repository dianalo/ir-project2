Sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens are a key part of the new law. But the INS repeatedly has said it intends to gradually phase in its enforcement of the law, which subjects employers to civil fines -- and even jail terms for egregious violations -- for hiring undocumented immigrants.    The INS statement came as the Senate considered whether to push back the beginning of the sanctions from June 1 to Oct. 1. In a vote late last Thursday, the Senate narrowly voted to approve that postponement. Another Senate vote on the measure is slated this week.    The immigration act, passed last October, provides for an initial period of public education lasting six months. But the INS said Friday that it still hasn't mailed a booklet to instruct employers on how to comply with the law. A senior INS official said Friday that the handbooks won't reach most employers until late June. </TEXT></DOC>
