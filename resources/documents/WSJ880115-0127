In response, the Colorado Industrial Bankers Association issued a statement assuring the public that deposits in these banks are either insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or backed by letters of credit from bank holding companies.    The industrial banks were set up in the 1920s to serve middle-income customers and working people who couldn't get loans at regular commercial banks. Now, some of the institutions also take deposits and offer interest-bearing checking accounts.    Also battered by a decline in the Colorado economy, 14 of the state's industrial banks either filed for bankruptcy-law protection or were taken over by state regulators in 1987. Of the 57 banks that continue to operate independently, 42 have FDIC protection, and the other 15 were ordered last year by the state Legislature to get FDIC insurance by July 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
