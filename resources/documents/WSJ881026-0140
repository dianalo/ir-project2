But people tempted to buy the shares should know that corporate insiders at several pollution control companies have been selling.    Interest in pollution control stocks was whetted by the war of words between George Bush and Michael Dukakis about who would do more for the environment. Several of the stocks are up 20% or more since the summer.    The selling has been heavy at three small pollution control companies -- Allwaste Inc., Enseco Inc. and Environmental Systems Co. There has also been slightly more than the usual amount of insider selling at big pollution control companies such as Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. and Waste Management Inc.    Two of the small companies, Enseco and Environmental Systems, have been on the auction block. Investors may interpret insider selling there to mean that no one's offering a favorable price for the companies. To some extent, analysts say, the selling also reflects the normal process by which entrepreneurs whose companies first went public a couple of years ago cash in by selling some of their shares.    At Allwaste, a small environmental services company in Stafford, Texas, four insiders have sold shares recently, each grossing at least $1 million. Between July and September, Allwaste stock rose from about $12 a share to more than $14. It closed yesterday at $14.25, up 12.5 cents. But Chairman Raymond L. Nelson Jr. says neither he nor his associates were influenced by the higher price.    &quot;If we were to sell at the high end, we'd have waited another two or three months,&quot; he said. Mr. Nelson's wife sold 172,000 shares last month at $14.375 to $14.75 a share, realizing $2,490,000. &quot;We had accumulated a lot of debt,&quot; Mr. Nelson said. &quot;We paid down a substantial portion of our debt. It gives me more peace of mind to run this company. I'm not debt-free yet, but I'm close.&quot; Mr. Nelson and his family still own 785,178 shares.    The seller at Enseco, a waste testing and environmental consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., is Mark J. Carter, a director. He sold 182,600 shares last month for about $2 million, at $10.25 to $12.375 a share. Mr. Carter was president of Rocky Mountain Analytical Laboratory Inc., which was taken over by Enseco.    He said he sold because he has left Enseco and &quot;needed the money for other business ventures.&quot; Specifically, he plans to wholesale California wine in Colorado, where he lives. &quot;All my net worth&quot; was in Enseco stock, he said. &quot;I think the prognosis for the (pollution control) industry is wonderful. But after 20 years I needed a change. I needed a breath of fresh air.&quot; Mr. Carter still owns 419,220 shares of Enseco, which closed yesterday at $9.625, down 37.5 cents.    At Environmental Systems, Chairman Melvyn Bell has sold 271,000 shares for $3.7 million in a series of 10 transactions since May, at $9.63 to $16.75 a share. But he still holds 1.7 million shares of stock, valued at $24 million at yesterday's closing price of $14.375. Mr. Bell couldn't be reached for comment on why he's been selling. He has several other business ventures, including radio stations, restaurants, and amusement parks.    ---   IT LAID AN EGG: Insider Reports Fund, which bills itself as &quot;the first and only mutual fund investing solely on the basis of reported insider&quot; transactions, is for sale.    Though its investment record for the past year hasn't been bad, the fund hasn't been able to attract investors. &quot;We're standing here with $2.5 million in assets. You really need $10 million to break even,&quot; says Aaron B. Feigen, president and portfolio manager. &quot;We've decided to look aggressively for someone to adopt it. The thing nowadays is families of funds.&quot;    For 1988 through Oct. 13, Insider Reports Fund shows a gain of 13.6%, a shade better than the 12% average for all equity funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services. But marketing efforts have &quot;laid an egg,&quot; Mr. Feigen says. &quot;Boesky (the insider trading scandal surrounding arbitrager Ivan Boesky) didn't help. And then the market crash came along.&quot;    If the fund isn't sold within a few months, &quot;I'll wind it down,&quot; says Mr. Feigen. &quot;The idea will come again some day.&quot;    ---   VACUUMING UP PROFITS: When Maytag Corp. agreed this week to buy Chicago Pacific Corp., the maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners, for $60 a share, at least one insider made handsome profits.    Lester Crown, a director and major shareholder in General Dynamics Corp., is a Chicago Pacific director. Family and charitable trusts of which he's a co-trustee purchased about 79,900 Chicago Pacific shares in August and September, bringing total holdings to about 1.6 million shares. The last reported purchase was 30,000 shares Sept. 9, for $34.125 a share. Mr. Crown couldn't be reached for comment.    ---   BIG POTATOES: Potato king J.R. Simplot, whose closely held company provides spuds to McDonald's Corp., is also a director at Micron Technology Inc. He spent $5.8 million recently to increase his Micron stake by 6%, adding 300,000 shares. Forbes Magazine lists the 79-year-old Mr. Simplot among the 400 wealthiest Americans, with an estimated net worth of $400 million.    (Revised WSJ Oct. 28, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
