It is alsonegotiating a new multibillion-dollar loan to replace some ofits commercial paper borrowings.   On Friday, Salomon Chairman Warren E. Buffett met withrepresentatives of more than 100 commercial banks to answerquestions about their potential exposure to variousnon-binding credit lines to Salomon, said to total $15billion. A Salomon spokesman said the firm would not commentabout any meetings or discussions about the firm's source offunds.</LP><TEXT>   The packed meeting, at Salomon's World Trade Centerheadquarters, was called after cracks began to appear in thesyndicate of banks that advance billions of dollars inovernight loans used to finance Salomon's inventories ofsecurities, sources in the bank syndicate said.   Without sufficient credit lines, the unit of Salomon Inc.could be forced to sell securities, causing its balance sheetand its operations to shrink. That could cut into the firm'srevenue, experts said. Wall Street trading firms such asSalomon maintain large inventories of securities to sell toclients and other dealers. Big inventories are considered anecessity for daily trading, in which firms make smallprofits on individual transactions and need heavy volume tofatten profit margins.   &quot;There's a direct relationship between revenues andassets,&quot; said Perrin Long, securities analyst at First ofMichigan Corp. &quot;A reduction of assets means a reduction ofrevenues and a reduction of profits.&quot;   Some banks, in particular Japanese lenders that themselveshave scandals at home, have balked at providing loans toSalomon where there is no binding obligation. The banks,which are supposed to provide Salomon with $15 billion ofuncommitted, discretionary funding, also provide a $2 billioncommitted credit line, for which Salomon pays a continuingcommitment fee, bankers said. That line, which is a backupfacility for Salomon's commercial paper, or short-term IOUs,has not been drawn.   &quot;Some {of the uncommitted} lines have been withdrawn,&quot;confirmed Mark Bachmann, ratings analyst at Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp. &quot;But they {Salomon} still have substantial linesthey're drawing on.&quot;   Two bankers with knowledge of the Friday meeting said itwas successful in allaying their concern about Salomon'sability to pay creditors if it runs into further problemsfrom its violations of Treasury-auction bidding rules.   Still, in an effort to obtain more permanent, committedfunding, Mr. Buffett has asked Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. toarrange a new, multibillion-dollar committed bank loan,bankers with knowledge of the talks said. They added that theloan is expected to be more than $2 billion, and will besecured by government securities.   Salomon Brothers &quot;wants to get as much fully committed asit can,&quot; said Sandamp;P's Mr. Bachmann, who said he is &quot;in constantcontact&quot; with the firm. Added John Kriz, a Moody's InvestorsService Inc. analyst who follows Salomon: &quot;They want to movetoward secured financing.&quot;   Mr. Buffett apparently convinced a number of banks thatwere on the fence about sticking with the firm. An officialat a Japanese institution, who had said before the meetinghis bank would shy away from Salomon, said Mr. Buffett'spitch was impressive and his bank now wants to provide a loanto the troubled firm.   &quot;It went well,&quot; this official said of the meeting. &quot;I amfavorably disposed to&quot; committing funds. Among the pointsmade by Salomon's finanical executives, as well as by Mr.Buffett, were evidence of the firm's ability to meet maturingdebt obligations and the diversity of Salomon's revenue base,according to an official of another bank who attended themeeting.   However, nervousness in the commercial paper market, whereSalomon Brothers once had average commercial paperoutstanding overnight in excess of $8 billion, is not as easyto overcome. Since the firm's government securities scandalbroke in mid-August, it has reduced its commercial paperoutstanding by about $3 billion. After the scandal broke, thefirm said it planned to lend some of its Treasury securitiesin repurchase agreements, or &quot;repos,&quot; to raise the cashneeded to pay off some maturing commercial paper.   But repos are short-term transactions that need to beconstantly rolled over. That explains why Salomon is seekinga new committed credit line with Morgan Guaranty's help.   It is unclear how much of the $15 billion in uncommittedcredit lines has already been advanced to the firm. As ofJuly 31, regulatory filings show that the firm had $5.6billion in bank loans outstanding.   In addition, banks appear to be standing behind the $2billion loan that backstops Salomon's commercial paperprogram. That is the only guaranteed loan the firm has, andonly a &quot;material adverse change&quot; in its financial situationcould warrant a withdrawal by banks from their commitment toadvance the loans. Lenders say they have not used thisclause. Salomon has not drawn down the loan, which it viewsit as a last resort, lenders and analysts said.   To be sure, Salomon's contingency plan, if faced with aliquidity crunch, appears to be securities sales. Almost 90%of its $120 billion-plus in assets are liquid securities.   So far, the nervousness among lenders has not reachedcrisis proportions, say analysts. Salomon is &quot;funding in anorderly and professional manner,&quot; said Mr. Kriz of Moody's.But the firm's funding &quot;is not what it was a while ago.&quot;   Both major credit rating agencies are still watchingSalomon's credit rating for another possible downgrade. Mr.Bachmann of Sandamp;P said he is still concerned about Salomon'sability to fund itself longer term. &quot;So far they are holdingtheir own. With more bad news, it could get worse,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
