The little red ball he ismaneuvering around his computer screen won't fit through anarrow, U-shaped gap.   Undaunted, he extends a video &quot;spring&quot; from the ball to asideline. Then he grabs part of the U-shape and moves it outof the way. The ball, powered by the spring, pops through thegap.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Surles hasn't just conquered the latest arcade game. Agraduate student in computer science at the University ofNorth Carolina, he's working on something more serious: aresearch project that may help biochemists design new drugs.The little red balls represent atoms, the U-shape thechemical bonds in a strand of protein. The length of thespring shows how much force is needed to get the atomthrough.   Still, Mr. Surles acknowledges that his project looks muchlike a video game -- and says the resemblance will soonbecome stronger, when he hooks his system to a joystick thatwill let him feel each atom's resistance to being moved. Thetechnology is similar to a driving game found in manyamusement arcades, he says.   Such real-world resonance is increasingly common for videogames, once dismissed as pernicious brain candy. Researchershave used computer graphics for years for everything frommonitoring heartbeats to designing cars, but never with suchgame-like interaction. As society deals with more informationvisually, however, features central to video games areseeping into conventional computer programs. Color, graphicsand instant feedback -- the idea that a computer shouldrespond immediately to its user's actions -- are all commonnow. Other game features, such as sound and animation, arearriving. The popular &quot;mouse&quot; pointing device is a closerelative of video-game controllers.   As a result of these changes, the computer industry isstarting to re-evaluate video games and their cousins,computer games, which run on regular computers rather thangame machines. &quot;There's a lot we need to learn from theNintendo experience,&quot; says Michael Braun, a vice president atInternational Business Machines Corp. who is formulating astrategy for integrating sound and video features into IBMproducts.   No one wants to turn spreadsheets into shoot-'em-upadventures. But researchers are trying to harness videogames' best qualities, from their addictive nature to theeffective way they allow players to deal with huge amounts ofdata. Tapping into such qualities, many experts suspect,could unleash computers' full potential.   Take Tetris, a game in which players scramble to arrangedifferent-shaped blocks into straight lines as the blockscascade from the top of the screen. &quot;If you expressed thoselittle shapes as numbers or {mathematical} formulas, Tetriswould be impossible to play,&quot; says Joseph Bates, acomputer-science professor at Carnegie Mellon University inPittsburgh. But &quot;because they're shapes, we solve the problemin a moment. The question is: Can we set up real-worldproblems so they can be solved in the same way?&quot;   Often, the answer seems to be yes. At the National Centerfor Supercomputing Applications in Urbana, Ill., researchershave made great leaps in understanding the industrial processof plastic injection molding. Their method: Translate datainto pictures of moving, three-dimensional pie wedges shapedand colored to represent how quickly, and in what direction,the plastic flows into various parts of the mold. Displayingthese pictures requires supercomputers or powerfulworkstations, but the technology is becoming more affordable.Dan Brady, head of the center's Visualization Laboratory,says video games' influence at the center has been indirectso far, but he would like to forge a closer link.   Meanwhile, joysticks and other gamelike devices arepopping up in many labs.   Silicon Graphics Inc., a maker of workstation computers,now sells a gizmo called Spaceball, which resembles abaseball atop a short spring; engineers use it to navigatethrough three-dimensional drawings. Mr. Surles, the graduatestudent, often controls his computer with a gadget called aPolhemus hand sensor, mounted in a cue ball that he waves inthe air.   Games themselves are also finding new respect. SphereInc., a small computergame company in Alameda, Calif., isusing software based on its Falcon flight-simulation game ina bid to make less-expensive F-16 simulators for NationalGuards nationwide. The prime contractor on the bid is defensegiant General Dynamics Corp. Sphere also says San Franciscoschools are testing one of its driving games for use as adriver-education tool. &quot;People have begun to see lightbulbs,&quot; says Gilman Louie, Sphere's founder.   Nintendo Co. also is scouting real-world applications: Itawarded a $3 million grant to the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology to study educational uses for its game machines.Seymour Papert, a theorist at MIT's Media Lab, spends much ofhis time talking to elementary-school kids who play Nintendo.The hypnotic power of video games fascinates Mr. Papert, whosuggests that this &quot;tunnel vision&quot; effect could aid in thelearning of new skills. &quot;It's a degree of engagement thatseems different,&quot; he says.   Mr. Bates of Carnegie Mellon is working on a project thatcould bring computerized role-playing games to the corporateenvironment, where they might be used to train employees; hedoes most of his noodling on a mystery game that was soldcommercially in the early 1980s. Two other Carnegie Mellonscientists have come up with a way to model near-light-speedtravel on a computer screen -- and say their first customerswill likely be makers of graphics-hungry arcade games.   &quot;Games are probably pushing harder on the graphics andsound capability of hardware than any other application,&quot;says Douglas Glen, managing director of LucasFilm Ltd.'sLucasFilm Games unit. Video games that use compact disks tostore sounds and images are just hitting toy stores, forinstance, and will be the first mass-market use of this&quot;multimedia&quot; technology.   Game makers say they will also be the first mainstreamusers of &quot;virtual reality,&quot; in which users don goggles,gloves and other devices that let them feel as if they'removing in, and interacting with, a cartoon-like computerworld. Toy maker Mattel Inc. already sells PowerGlove, anadd-on device for Nintendo that uses virtual-reality methodspioneered at VPL Research Inc. The PowerGlove substitutes fora video-game controller, allowing wearers to control Nintendogames using hand gestures. At Wavefront Technologies Inc., amaker of high-powered graphics software, Chairman LawrenceBarels argues that this popularizing role makes video-gamecompanies &quot;true technology pioneers.&quot;   Like many industry players, Mr. Barels thinks the biggesttriumph for game-like approaches may come in Wall Street'strading community. He says Wavefront is working with severalinvestment firms to turn market data into colorful picturesthat should allow traders to spot opportunities more quickly.   If combined with computerized ordertaking systems, Mr.Barels says, such software could make trading desks look alot like amusement arcades. Says Jerry Kargman, who developsadvanced trading systems for IBM: &quot;If we just got smartenough, we could figure out how to trade just like playingSuper Mario Brothers.&quot;   Comments like that arouse some skepticism. Edward Tufte,who has written several books on how to present information,says video games are overrated. Their main lesson, he says,is that people can master some software without using amanual. But he condemns many games as deliberately puzzling.&quot;A much better thing to emulate,&quot; he says, &quot;would be anewspaper or a book -- or a map.&quot;   Proponents of games counter that a glance at any newcomputer screen-full of color and graphics, controlled by amouse -- proves that video games have lessons to impart. &quot;Ofcourse, people will never admit that they've borrowedanything from video games,&quot; says Mr. Louie of Sphere.&quot;They'll call it multimedia, they'll call it real-time video.They'll call it anything but a game.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
