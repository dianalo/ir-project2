The company said it was aware of 12 engine fires, but no injuries from the potential problems. The U.S. sales arm of Audi AG of West Germany said it will replace certain parts in the fuel system in 22,000 1987-model Audi 5000 Turbo models.    Separately, Chrysler Corp. said it is recalling about 3,900 1987 model LeBaron convertibles to replace driver's accessory floor mats. The auto maker said the mats could slip and depress the accelerator pedal even after the driver has released it. Chrysler, Highland Park, Mich., said it wasn't aware of any accidents or injuries from the problem.    Audi of America said if a driver overfills the gas tank, defective parts could create fuel vapors and ignite the engine compartment.    The company also is recalling 35,000 1986 and 1987 model Audi 5000 cars to inspect the rear brakes. Under certain conditions, one of the two brake systems could fail. </TEXT></DOC>
