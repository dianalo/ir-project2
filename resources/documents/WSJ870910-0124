Great Midwestern Ice Cream Co., a Fairfield, Iowa, ice cream maker, reports that &quot;Bush's Preppymint&quot; is currently outselling &quot;Dole's Top Banana,&quot; &quot;Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Sundae&quot; and even &quot;Paul Simon's Bow Tie Brickle&quot; in what is (one would hope) the nation's only political straw poll based on ice cream sales.    The ice cream company recently came up with a flavor for each presidential aspirant running in the state and is keeping a running tally of customers' favorites at its five Iowa outlets. The latest update shows Mr. Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis (&quot;Massachewy Chocolate&quot;) leading their respective party races.    &quot;We're trying to add another dimension to the very serious business of picking the president,&quot; says Fred Gratzon, Great Midwestern's founder and chairman.    Mr. Gratzon, 41, a former transcendental-meditation teacher and rock-band drummer, dreamed up the ice cream poll about three weeks ago. He called the candidates' campaign staffs, asking for flavor suggestions. Rep. Richard Gephardt's staff came up with &quot;St. Louis Bluesberry,&quot; which stuck. &quot;Nevada Nugget,&quot; chosen by Sen. Paul Laxalt's staff, lasted longer than the senator's aborted campaign. Mr. Gratzon says his only complaint came from Pat Robertson's staff. &quot;They wanted us to call his flavor 'Peppermint Patty,' but what's funny about that?&quot; he says. So Mr. Robertson got &quot;Born Again Chocolate.&quot;    Some political operatives dismiss any link between ice cream and presidential preferences. &quot;Just because people aren't crazy about banana, that doesn't mean they don't like Dole,&quot; says a spokeswoman for Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, currently the cellar dweller in the ice cream poll.    But Mr. Gratzon says his company's ice cream sales will eventually bear out the state's political preferences. And he says some campaign staffers apparently agree. &quot;We're beginning to get some large orders from people we believe are connected with certain campaigns,&quot; he says. &quot;Sort of like stuffing the ballot box.&quot;    With the ice cream ballot gaining momentum, of sorts, the company is considering tagging along with a bus of its own as the presidential campaign rolls on into other states. &quot;We envision it as a combination ice cream stand and rolling polling booth,&quot; Mr. Gratzon says. </TEXT></DOC>
