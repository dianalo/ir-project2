A state appeals court ruled that the drug companies cannotcompel the women to turn over copies of medical recordspertaining to their fathers, siblings and other familymembers. The manufacturers were seeking the records to showthat the women's injuries may have resulted from genetic orhereditary factors rather than from exposure to the drug.</LP><TEXT>   The drug's manufacturers have always contended thatexposure to DES caused no serious injury. &quot;The rulingdeprives us of access to material that is vital to ourdefense,&quot; says A. Edward Grashof, a New York lawyer whorepresents Rexall Corp., a defendant in the case. Otherdefendants include Eli Lilly andamp; Co., Indianapolis;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., New York, and Upjohn Co.,Kalamazoo, Mich.   A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly said the company planned toappeal. Defense lawyers for several other defendants saidtheir clients were undecided.   DES, or diethylstilbestrol, was prescribed during a30-year period beginning in the 1940s to reduce the chancesof miscarriage during pregnancy. It was banned for this useby the Food and Drug Administration in 1971 after the FDAfound abnormally high incidences of vaginal and cervicalcancer in daughters of women who had taken the drug.   In the lawsuits, the women plaintiffs contend that theirexposure to the drug in the womb caused infertility, cancerand miscarriages. There hasn't been any scientific evidencelinking DES to health problems among sons of women who tookthe drug.   Lawyers for both sides said the implications of theappeals court decision could extend beyond the pharmaceuticalindustry. In cases involving exposure to manmade toxicsubstances, more and more courts are being forced to weigh aplaintiff's right to privacy against a defendant's need formedical information that might suggest other causes fordiseases or injuries.   The 800 plaintiffs involved in the New York cases hadrefused to provide the information on the ground that familymembers who aren't parties to the litigation have a right toprivacy under the state's patient-physician confidentialitylaws. Last year, the trial court judge who is coordinatingall the cases rejected their confidentiality argument.   In reversing that decision, the appeals court wrote thatwhile the women must provide their mothers' medical recordsduring pregnancy, the rest of their families are entitled toprivacy. &quot;The mere fact that a relative, distant or near interms of kinship, has commenced a medical malpractice actionalleging a birth defect should not subject all her relativesto the `long arm' reach of the law authorizing their medicalhistories opened to all,&quot; the appeals court wrote.   Stuart Finz, a New York lawyer representing theplaintiffs, said that in the past many pharmaceuticalcompanies had routinely sought medical information aboutfamily members as a way of harassing the plaintiffs. &quot;Thereis only a minimal possibility that the medical records ofdistant relatives will be useful to the companies' case. Theoverriding issue is the families' right to privacy,&quot; saidLeonard Finz, another lawyer for the plaintiffs.   Defense lawyers responded that the drug companies hadsought medical information only for valid purposes. Theyadded that they would be willing to have the medical recordskept out of the public record to preserve the families'privacy.   ---   ANTITRUST TO BE EXPORTED to Eastern Europe by U.S lawyers.   The Bush administration said it will send teams ofgovernment lawyers to six former communist bloc countries toteach officials there about drafting and enforcing antitrustlaws. The first six-member team from the Justice Departmentand the Federal Trade Commission is expected to arrive inCzechoslovakia on Saturday.   The program won't exacerbate severe manpower problems atthe U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies, U.S. officials said,because the Agency for International Development has agreedto provide $7.2 million for the legal-assistance mission.   In response to requests from Central and Eastern Europeangovernments during the past year, U.S. government lawyershave made trips to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria andHungary to discuss &quot;competition issues and law-enforcementtechniques,&quot; the Justice Department said.   James Rill, the department's antitrust chief, explainedthat &quot;the AID funding will permit us to respond to theserequests in a systematic way.&quot;   ---   REVOLVING DOOR: Richard Gregorie, the former federalprosecutor who helped supervise the indictment of formerPanamanian leader Manuel A.
