Many areas of southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio -- whichhave been inundated with rain in the past 30 days -- got morethan an inch of rain overnight Wednesday, and more wasexpected last night.</LP><TEXT>   The wet weather has kept many farmers from finishing theircorn planting. Conventional wisdom calls for farmers to plantall their corn within the first week of June for maximumyields and to shift unplanted corn fields to soybeans afterthat. AgResource Co. of Chicago said it reduced its plantingestimate for corn from 76 million acres to between 73.5 and74 million acres and may reduce it again today if the rainscontinue.   The rain and cool temperatures also have inhibited growthin what farmers have managed to plant, resulting in shallowroot development in the young corn crop, analysts said.Weather forecasters now expect a high-pressure ridge to moveinto the western corn belt soon, bringing hot, dry conditionsthat could damage the fragile plants.   Corn futures helped set the pace at the Chicago Board ofTrade as the July contract rose 5 1/2 cents a bushel tosettle at $2.8550.   &quot;We think weather becomes increasingly important as thecrop gets into its development stage, and it's likely thatcorn futures will continue their rally,&quot; said Daniel Basse,director of market research for AgResource.   Soybean and related futures contracts also rose, both insympathy with corn and on expectations that Pakistan willorder 90,000 metric tons of soybean oil under the Food ForPeace program, analysts said. The July soybean oil contract,which at one point was up by its one-cent-a-pound limit,settled just shy of that at 24.42 cents a pound, up 0.97cent.   &quot;Soybean oil traded over some very key resistancepatterns,&quot; said Steve Freed, senior grain analyst for DeanWitter Reynolds Inc. &quot;In general, people think that beanshave turned the corner and bounced off their lows.&quot;   Though beans can be planted later than corn, it's startingto get late for bean planting as well, analysts said, and anyreduction in estimates of bean crop yields would drive pricesup.   Wheat futures prices also rose, in part because the SovietUnion was offered two million metric tons of export bonuswheat, Mr. Basse of AgResource said. Weather also is a factorfor wheat, as the possibility of hot, dry conditions in thePlains states threatens crops there.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil prices plunged in the final hour of avolatile session in which edgy traders bid prices up or downon the smallest of news events. Triggering the late sell-offwas a report that Exxon Corp. would reopen a refinery andterminal in Linden, N.J., this month. The facilities wereclosed early this year after a number of oil spills.Presumably, the reopening of the refinery would add to thealready large gasoline inventories. Gains in gasoline pricesearlier had boosted crude contracts. Crude for July deliveryended on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $16.67 a barrel,down 25 cents. It had traded as high as $17.32 during thesession. Unleaded gasoline for July delivery wound up at57.61 cents a gallon, down 0.75 cent.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended lower but partlyrecovered from early declines. Gold for August deliveryfinished with a loss of $2.90 an ounce at $358.10. Julysilver was off 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.04. July platinumdeclined $1.90 an ounce to $487.50. Japanese and MiddleEastern selling of gold bullion combined to depress pricesearly in the day, an analyst said. But the Middle Easternselling, which took place in Europe, didn't involve the largequantities that caused prices to plunge twice recently, hesaid. The soon-to-expire June contract, which reflected cashmarket dealings, at one point fell as low as $352.10 anounce, off $5.30 from Wednesday's close, and August, the mostactively traded month, fell to another life-of-contract lowof $355.50. Reports of political unrest in the Soviet Unionplayed a role in the decline, as did concern that shortagesof foreign exchange in the Soviet Union and South Africacould cause those nations to become more aggressive sellersof gold. The analyst said that with Europe approaching itssummer vacation period, it's not likely to show the kind ofactive demand that would be needed to boost prices. ButRichard Band, editor of Profitable Investing, a newsletter inPotomac, Md., said: &quot;I found it encouraging that gold cameback a bit from its early lows. This is a typical pattern ofa market nearing its bottom; it absorbs a lot of Europeanselling, then ends up moderately off the lows.&quot;                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices were mixed, with the July contractdeclining and new-crop months from October onward rising inresponse to weather problems affecting the early part of thenext crop. July cotton, the last remaining current-cropcontract, ended with a loss of 0.26 cent a pound at 80.84cents. Prices weakened as speculators and computer-drivencommodity funds sold the July contract after it traded abovea key resistance level and rose as high as 81.25 cents. Whenit fell to a low of 79.80 cents, the selling waned and thecontract started to recover. The later contracts, for cottonharvested in the 1990-91 season that will begin Aug. 1,posted gains of between 0.35 cent and 1.13 cents a pound.Demand was triggered by problems in unirrigated areas of theRio Grande Valley in Texas. Those areas haven't had any rainin the past week and a half, and temperatures have soared, ananalyst said. The Rio Grande crop is important because it isthe first U.S. cotton harvested in the new season -- actuallybeginning in July -- and so provides a continuity of supply,tiding industry over from the old crop to the new one, theanalyst said.</TEXT></DOC>
