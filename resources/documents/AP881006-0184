Starting Thursday, Tomin had a job _ as a barroom philosopher.   Noel Reilly is paying the 49-year-old thinker $8,500 to givethree lectures a year at his Beehive pub in Swindon, 70 miles westof London.   Tomin thinks the 100-year-old pub is just the sort of placewhere Socrates, a poor man who went barefoot, might have engaged inhis philosophical dialogues in ancient Athens.   The first talk by the bespectacled philosopher was a discourseon freedom to a good-natured, occasionally boisterous but generallyreverent crowd.   Tomin, a Czechoslovak dissident emigre, steered clear of Greekphilosophers, dwelling instead on the meaning of freedom to aprisoner.   As customers sipped their beers, Tomin told of pounding on hiscell door for a drink of water, being refused, and pounding againuntil he got it _ proof, he said, that ``wherever you are you cando something.   ``You can make your freedom work, even if you're underinterrogation. There's a level where you can be free, no matterwhat situation you're in.''   Customers applauded at the end of his talk.   Tomin fled to Britain in 1980. He hasn't been able to land anacademic post, but he refused to take a job that might distract himfrom his beloved pursuit of ancient Greek philosophy. That ledauthorities to cut off his $114 weekly welfare check.   Tomin's plight became public at a philosophers' congress in thesouthern seaside town of Brighton in August. Tomin had spent mostof his money on registration fees and had cycled 100 miles fromOxford, where he spends his time poring over philosophical works inuniversity libraries.   His job at the Beehive pub entails giving a half-hour discoursefollowed by a half-hour discussion with customers.   A signatory to the Czechoslovak human rights manifesto Charter77, Tomin won brief acclaim among philosophy scholars when he held``underground'' seminars in his Prague apartment in defiance ofauthorities. His controversial ideas on Plato's philosophicaldevelopment, however, have been dismissed by leading Britishscholars as ingenious but weak.   Swindon once had a poor reputation in intellectual circles. Cityelders banned the medieval classic ``Decameron'' in a 1954 rulingthat was overturned amid nationwide uproar.   One Beehive customer, interviewed on British Broadcasting Corp.radio, joked that his knowledge of philosophy amounted basically to``I drink, therefore I am.''   But things have changed. The city of 91,000 has become thecapital of Britain's mail-order book market, and publican Reilly, ared-bearded Irishman, believes Tomin will further raise the tone.   Opening night was by free ticket only, and all 700 tickets weresnapped up. Loudspeakers were set up for crowds outside.   ``Who would have thought you could get all those people to comeand listen to a philosopher?'' marveled Reilly.   He said his pub was no place for drunken displays.``Manifestations of ignorance will never be considered a virtue inthis house,'' he said.   In recent interviews, Tomin said Plato, a student of Socrates,also had views on pubs. Plato complained in his Laws that theyshould be ``places of generosity and conviviality,'' but insteadhad become ``places where the publican robbed the people.''   Reilly thinks his ``visiting philosopher'' will have animportant influence on his patrons.   ``Rumor has it that some of them have been seen in the localbookshop buying books on philosophy recently so that at leastthey've got some kind of a head start,'' he said.   Did he feel ancient Greek philosophy had relevance today?   ``Good heavens, yes. Truth always has relevance,'' Reillyreplied. ``One cannot disguise it by buying flashy motor cars, onecannot put tinsel over it. Truth is truth.''</TEXT></DOC>
