If the person proposinga new discharge does not receive a request for additional information ora notification of denial from the permit issuing authority, authorizationto discharge in accordance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemedgranted. For existing individually authorized discharges, coverage underthe general permit will not be effective unless and until the individualpermit is either revoked or inactivated. The permit issuing authority maywaive, at its discretion, the thirty (30) day period in special cases.B. Definitions.1. The ``30-day (and monthly) average,'' is the arithmetic average of allsamples collected during a consecutive 30-day period or calendar month,whichever is applicable. The calendar month shall be used for purposesof reporting self-monitoring data on discharge monitoring report forms.2. ``Daily Maximum'' (``Daily Max.'') is the maximum value allowable inany single sample or instantaneous measurement.3. ``Composite samples'' shall be flow proportioned. The composite sampleshall, as a minimum, contain at least four (4) samples collected over thecompositing period. Unless otherwise specified, the time between the collectionof the first sample and the last sample shall not be less than six (6)hours nor more than 24 hours. Acceptable methods for preparation of compositesamples are as follows:a. Constant time interval between samples, sample volume proportional toflow rate at time of sampling;b. Constant time interval between samples, sample volume proportional tototal flow (volume) since last sample. For the first sample, the flow rateat the time the sample was collected may be used;c. Constant sample volume, time interval between samples proportional toflow (i.e., sample taken every ``X'' gallons of flow); and,d. Continuous collection of sample, with sample collection rate proportionalto flow rate.4. A ``grab'' sample, for monitoring requirements, is defined as a single``dip and take'' sample collected at a representative point in the dischargestream.5. An ``instantaneous'' measurement, for monitoring requirements, is definedas a single reading, observation, or measurement.6. ``Upset'' means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentionaland temporary noncompliance with technology-based permit effluent limitationsbecause of factors beyond the reasonable control of the permittee. An upsetdoes not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error,improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities,lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.7. ``Bypass'' means the intentional diversion of waste streams from anyportion of a treatment facility.8. ``Severe property damage'' means substantial physical damage to property,damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable,or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonablybe expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damagedoes not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.9. ``Director'' means Director of the United States Environmental ProtectionAgency's Water Management Division.10. ``EPA'' means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.11. ``Sludge'' is any solid, semi-solid or liquid residue that containsmaterials removed from the wastewater during treatment.12. ``Waters of the United States'' means:a.

Need to Halt or Reduce Activity Not a Defense It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action thatit would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity inorder to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit.D. Duty to Mitigate The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent anydischarge in violation of this permit which has a reasonable likelihoodof adversely affecting human health or the environment.E. Proper Operation and Maintenance The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilitiesand systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances) whichare installed or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditionsof this permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequatelaboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. Thisprovision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities orsimilar systems which are installed by a permittee only when the operationis necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit. However,the permittee shall operate, as a minimum, one complete set of each mainline unit treatment process, whether or not this process is needed to achievepermit effluent compliance.F. Removed Substances Collected screenings, grit, solids, sludges, or other pollutants removedin the course of treatment shall be buried or disposed of in such a mannerso as to prevent any pollutant from entering any waters of the state orcreating a health hazard. Sludge/digester supernatant and filter backwashshall not be directly blended with or enter either the final plant dischargeand/or waters of the United States.G. Bypass of Treatment Facilities <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Bypass Not Exceeding Limitations </ITAG>The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause effluentlimitations to be exceeded, but only if it also is for essential maintenanceto assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisionsof paragraphs 2. and 3. of this section.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Notice. </ITAG>a. <T3>Anticipated bypass.</T3> If the permittee knows in advance of the needfor a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least 60 daysbefore the date of the bypass. b. <T3>Unanticipated bypass.</T3> The permittee shall submit notice of anunanticipated bypass as required under <T3>part II.H., Twenty-four Hour Reporting.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Prohibition of Bypass </ITAG>a. Bypass is prohibited and the Director may take enforcement action againsta permittee for a bypass, unless: (1) The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,or severe property damage; (2) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the useof auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenanceduring normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfiedif adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exerciseof reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass which occurredduring normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance;and, (3) The permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph 2. of thissection.H. Upset Conditions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Effect of an Update </ITAG>An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliancewith technology-based permit effluent limitations if the requirements ofparagraph 2. of this section are met. No determination made during administrativereview of claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and before anaction for noncompliance, is final administrative action subject to judicialreview (i.e., Permittees will have the opportunity for a judicial determinationon any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliancewith technology-based permit effluent limitations).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. </ITAG>A permittee who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shalldemonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, orother relevant evidence that: a. An upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) ofthe upset;b. The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; c. The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required under Part II.H.,<T3>Twenty-four Hour Notice of Noncompliance Reporting;</T3> and, d. The permittee complied with any remedial measures required under <T3>part III.D., Duty to Mitigate.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Burden of Proof </ITAG>In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the occurrenceof an upset has the burden of proof.I.
