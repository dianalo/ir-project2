Gervaise Davis, a Monterey, Calif., lawyer who specializes incomputer issues.andM;&quot;This decision is the last thing in the world the American computer industryor consumers need,&quot; Davis said.andP;  &quot;It says the first guy who does somethingowns it.andP;  It forces everyone else to do things different ways.andP;  It goes theopposite way of standardization.&quot;andM;Susan Nycum, a computer law attorney in Palo Alto, Calif., agreed.andP;  &quot;There isgoing to be a cooling effect, if not a chilling effect, on other companies'enthusiasm for developing similar products,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;It will be prettyhard to go up against an established product.&quot;andM;In contrast, Esther Dyson, editor of New York-based Release 1.0 newsletter,said she thought the decision would promote new ideas.andP;  &quot;I think itencourages innovation because people aren't doing the same stuff over andover,&quot; Dyson said.andM;&quot;If you're going to take something and improve upon it, you should licenseit,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Developers might invest a little more money in theirproducts to do a good job to get people to license them.andP;  It's better than ifeveryone does a second-rate job.&quot;andM;Some legal observers said that the ruling might help Apple in the industry'smost celebrated look-and-feel suit, Apple vs.andP;  Microsoft Corp. andHewlett-Packard Co.andP;  Apple's lead counsel, Jack Brown of Brown andamp; Bain inPhoenix, agreed that the ruling was directly in line with Apple's position.andM;&quot;It's a very scholarly, well-written opinion.andP;  It addresses the issues raisedby Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard quite directly,&quot; Brown said.andP;  &quot;I thought itwas a very useful additional precedent for our case.&quot; n</TEXT></DOC>
