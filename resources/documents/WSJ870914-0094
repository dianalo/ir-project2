As previously reported, CBS directors are expected to meet as early as this week to consider the sale of the unit as a result of the Sony inquiry.    In a statement, CBS said it isn't currently negotiating any sale of its record operations. &quot;CBS will consider and respond to Sony's inquiry in due course,&quot; the company said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, CBS closed at $208.50 a share, up $9.50.    Separately, the CBS network went black for six minutes Friday night when CBS News anchorman Dan Rather walked off his set, angry that coverage of the U.S. Open tennis tournament had overrun its air time.    The CBS network went black at about 6:33 p.m. EST Friday when Mr. Rather left a CBS set in the network's Miami news bureau to complain to CBS officials of the tennis coverage overrun. CBS News was broadcasting from Miami to cover the visit of Pope John Paul II.    CBS sources called the blackout a &quot;mishap,&quot; asserting that Mr. Rather and his team were unaware that the network would go black when he left to telephone CBS officials. &quot;Clearly if he had known the network was going to go black, he wouldn't have done it,&quot; one news official said.    A CBS spokesman declined to comment on the incident, which CBS sources described as unprecedented. </TEXT></DOC>
