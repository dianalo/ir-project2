A general rule for predictingthe sign and magnitude of the concentration dependence of transferencenumbers is established. Literature data are reevaluated with the helpof these equations and consistency of experimental data with the predictionis examined. Reference data for ion limiting conductances from experimentalinvestigations are proposed which may be used for the judgment as tothe reliability of empirical reference electrolyte methods.</TEXT></DOC>
