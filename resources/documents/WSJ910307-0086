The 21-nation International Energy Agency yesterdayannounced an end to the emergency oil-supply program launchedat the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war.</LP><TEXT>   The program, which was designed to free up 2.5 millionbarrels a day in additional oil supplies, had drawn sharpcriticism from the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries and from many oil companies. Even though it neverreached targeted levels, it was blamed for contributing to anoil glut and for helping to trigger the one-day plunge in oilprices of more than $10 a barrel on Jan. 17.   By tapping into emergency government stockpiles, includingthe U.S. strategic petroleum reserve, the program had beenintended to calm jittery oil markets during the Gulf war. Itwas to provide the bulk of the emergency supplies through therelease of two million barrels a day from government-held andgovernment-controlled stockpiles. The remaining 500,000barrels a day was to be made up through conservation andemergency measures in the industrial nations.   The IEA officials who announced the end of the program atthe agency's Paris headquarters yesterday described it as asuccess because it helped reassure oil markets concernedabout the war's impact on oil supplies. Now, with thecessation of the war, the oil markets appear to bewell-supplied, Helga Steeg, the IEA's executive director,said.   Although it's an important symbolic gesture, ending theprogram probably won't have a significant impact on oilmarkets. Sales of the emergency supplies were much less thananticipated. The sales came mainly from government stockpilesin the U.S., Germany and Denmark. IEA officials said knownstockpile releases averaged about 600,000 barrels a day overa 30-day period, a total of some 18 million barrels, or lessthan one day's production by OPEC.   Still, the end of the emergency supply program is welcomenews to OPEC, which faces a struggle to keep oil prices fromcrashing when demand drops in the traditionally weak secondquarter. And, in what could be more good news for OPEC, IEAChairman Geoffrey Chipperfield told a news conference thatthe agency is going to consider a dialogue betweenoil-consuming and oil-producing countries.   But it won't be clear until next week whether OPEC canaccomplish the next step, restraint of its own production,that most oil experts consider mandatory to prop up prices.The recent rally in prices, which had been expected to dropat the end of the war, was based, in fact, on anticipationthat the oil ministers will act to cut output.   This hasn't escaped the attention of OPEC. &quot;The market isbullish because people think we are going to do something inGeneva,&quot; said a senior OPEC official.   The meeting of the monitoring committee of the 13 OPECministers is significant because it is their first since theGulf war, and it can be turned into an official conferencequickly if the ministers agree to restore production quotas.   &quot;It appears that they are going to discuss quotas and somesort of new production ceiling,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, aVienna-based consultant on OPEC affairs. &quot;They will try tocome up with an interim agreement to get prices back up to$21&quot; a barrel, he said.   That is the reference price set by OPEC last July for itsbasket of crudes. But the price of those crudes currentlyaverages only slightly more than $16 a barrel despite therecent rally.   In July, OPEC was still operating under production quotas,which were abandoned in August after the Gulf crisis began.But, in December, the ministers agreed they would return tothe July agreement and its production ceiling of 22.5 millionbarrels a day as soon as the crisis ended.   Now, however, world oil markets may require an OPECceiling much lower than that, at least briefly. OPEC's ownforecasters expect demand for OPEC oil, including changes inworld oil inventories, to average only about 21.5 millionbarrels a day in the second quarter.   The IEA and others estimate, meanwhile, that OPECproduction has been averaging around 23 million barrels a dayeven though neither Iraq nor Kuwait is able to export anyoil. There is little evidence of any slowing of output. &quot;Theyare still going flat out,&quot; said Conrad Gerber, whoseGeneva-based Petro-Logistics Ltd., monitors OPEC output.</TEXT></DOC>
