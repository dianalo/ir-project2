LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Israeli government adviser whoallegedly played a role in the Iran-Contra affair was not on ``anyofficial business'' when he was killed in a plane crash in Mexico,the Israeli Embassy said Friday.   Amiram Nir was killed Wednesday while traveling under an assumedname. Nir, 37, was a former conterterrorism adviser to Israel whoonce briefed Vice President George Bush on secret arms sales to Iran.   He was killed Wednesday when a Cessna T210 he had charteredcrashed at a ranch near Ciudad Hidalgo in Michoacan state, 110 mileswest of Mexico City. The pilot also was killed and three otherpassengers were injured.   Embassy spokesman Israel Mey-Ami said in a telephone interview:``He was not here in any official business and he did not contactthe embassy. I don't know how long he was in this country, but itmusn't have been very long.''   Mey-Ami said he went to Morelia, the Michoacan state capital, onThursday to get the body and bring it to Mexico City. He said itwould returned to Israel.   Isauro Gutierrez Fernandez, a spokesman for the state attorneygeneral's office, said Nir was traveling under the name Pat Weber.   Gutierrez said by telephone Thursday he did not know why Nir wasusing as assumed name and Mey-Ami said he had no more details.   Nir arrived in Mexico City on Sunday and traveled to Uruapan, 190miles west, to stay with friends. ``it appears he had some possiblebusiness involving shipments of products from Latin America toEurope,'' Gutierrez said.   Dov Schmorak, the Israeli ambassador, said in an interview onIsrael's army radio that Nir apparently missed a regularly scheduledflight from Uruapan to Mexico City and hired a private plane.   He quoted Mexican authorities as saying preliminary informationsuggested the crash was caused by a rain storm.   Lawrence E. Walsh, special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case,had sought Nir for questioning, but Israel insisted he be grantedimmunity from prosecution so Nir never testified.   Testimony given to U.S. congressional investigators said Nir wasan important liaison in secret arms deals involving the sale of U.S.weapons to Iran.   Former White House aide Oliver North suggested it was Nir's ideato divert funds from the arms sales to Nicaraguan rebels. Israel hasdenied it.   Shimon Peres, now Israeli foreign minister, appointed Nir as hisadviser on counterterrorism in 1985 when he was prime minister andassigned him to serve as liaison with North.   Nir, a former journalist, met in Washington with North and Adm.John Poindexter, President Reagan's national security adviser, inJanuary 1986 and proposed renewing arms shipments to Iran. Atmeetings with North in Europe and Israel, he discussed shipping U.S.arms through Israel and diverting profits to the rebels, known asContras.   A ban by the Congress on military aid to the Contras was in forceat the time.   The Israeli also accompanied North and Robert McFarlane, theformer national security adviser, to Iran in May 1986 to discuss therelease of American hostages held by pro-Iranian Lebanese in returnfor Hawk wanti-aircraft Hawk missiles.   On July 27, 1986, he briefed Bush on the program involving U.S.weapons sales to Iran. Bush said he does not remember much about thebriefing, although his aide Craig Fuller attended the meeting andtook notes.   Nir stayed on after Yitzhak Shamir succeeded Peres as primeminister in October 1986 and the Iran-Contra affair exploded thatNovember. He resigned this year.</TEXT></DOC>
