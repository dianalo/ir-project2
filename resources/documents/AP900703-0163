Pilot error, mechanical problems, bad weather, impatientpassengers and pilot unfamiliarity with terrain and weather aremost commonly cited as the cause of Alaska's airplane accidents.   Since June 1, 35 airplanes have crashed in Alaska. Ten peoplehave died in four separate accidents, Michelangelo said. Five werekilled in a June 25 crash of a Cessna 207 on what was to have beenan 80-minute sightseeing trip out of Seward.   Ten of the accidents involved air-taxi operators; 25 involvedprivate aircraft, Michelangelo said.   There are 219 air-taxi operators in Alaska and more than 9,000private airplanes and registered pilots, said Paul Steucke,spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration here.   That translates into about eight times as many pilots per capita_ and 15 times as many aircraft per capita _ as the rest of theUnited States, the FAA says.   Most pilots and air-taxi operators in Alaska are conscientiousabout safety and do a good job, Steucke said. He said their clientssometimes unwittingly play a role in accidents by pressuring pilotsto take risks.   Tourists typically are on a tight schedule and sometimesreluctant to wait out bad weather, he said.   ``Sometimes they go down the street looking for another carrierafter one pilot tells them it's too dangerous to fly,'' he said.   There were a dozen crashes within 30 hours starting Sundayevening and ending early Tuesday.   In the only fatal wreck, the private pilot's lack of familiaritywith local wind patterns may have contributed to a crash at IliamnaLake Sunday that killed two people, said Bob Cusack, a lodge ownerwho helped rescue the four survivors.   Cusack, a guide and pilot himself, said gusty winds that eveninghad dissuaded him from flying some clients back to Anchorage, about200 miles away.</TEXT></DOC>
