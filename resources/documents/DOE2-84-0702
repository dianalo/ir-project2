Currently, the Gas Research Institute is responsible for twotechnology development projects for SOFCs. In order to ensure that thetechnology development activities result in a market oriented energysystem, an applications and economic assessment of SOFCs in the commercialbuilding sector was conducted. This paper presents the results of thisassessment. Included in this paper is a comparative evaluation of competingcogeneration technologies serving representative building energy loads.GRI, along with Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Science ApplicationsInternational Corporation (SAIC), conducted an application and economicassessment of SOFC's. The major findings important to the market developmentof SOFC's are presented below.</TEXT></DOC>
