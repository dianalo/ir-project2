The experiments were carried out usingSokol device consisting of ionization calorimeter and two Cherenkov counters.It is shown that the ratio between different cosmic ray nuclei in therange of charges 2{le}Z{le}26 in the energy range 1-10 TeV is similarto that at considerably lower energies. The energy distribution of separateHe, C, O, Fe nuclei in the energy range from approximately 2 to approximately50 TeV doesn't contradict the ratio {epsilon}/sup 2.5/ I({epsilon})=const,where I({epsilon}) - intensity at the energy of {epsilon} GeV/nucleon.</TEXT></DOC>
