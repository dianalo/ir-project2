Nicholas Nicola smiled as he walked down the steps of a scheduledIran Air flight at London's Heathrow Airport. He did not speak toreporters and was taken away in a car by his father, who met himwith Foreign Office officials.   ``We were absolutely taken by surprise,'' said a Foreign Officespokesman who asked not to be identified. ``We're pleased and welook forward to the same thing happening with Roger Cooper.''   However, there was no word on the possible release of Cooper, abusinessman who speaks fluent Farsi and has lived in Iran for morethan 20 years.   In what appears to be a more complex case, Cooper, 52, has beenaccused of spying _ a charge not levied at Nicola.   Iranian officials say Nicola, a 23-year-old tourist traveling byland from Pakistan, was arrested on the Iranian border with firearmsin September 1986. Some Iranian reports say he shot at lights at anIranian border post.   Britain said Nicola was held without trial in Tehran's maximumsecurity Evin Prison, where Cooper also is jailed.   But the English-language Tehran Times reported Tuesday thatNicola was tried and sentenced to a 3{-year prison term ``for thepossession of two weapons and a number of cartridges.'' It said thesentence was reduced for good behavior.   Nicola was handed over Monday to British Charge d'Affaires GordonPirie, who reopened the British Embassy on Dec. 9.   ``The family was very pleased to have him back and they were veryemotional about it,'' his uncle, Avraam Christou, said in a BritishBroadcasting Corp. television interview.   Britain withdrew all its diplomats in Tehran and only one Iranianenvoy remained in London after a dispute which began when Britishpolice arrested an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges May 1987.Iranian Revolutionary Guards then kidnapped and beat up a Britishdiplomat.   Britain has accused Iran of breaching the Vienna Convention byallowing only one visit by a British diplomat to Nicola and Cooper.   Improved Anglo-Iranian relations have raised modest hopes forBritish hostages believed held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 49, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987,while seeking the release of American hostages in Lebanon andjournalist John McCarthy, 32, was abducted April 17, 1986.   Islamic kidnappers claim to have killed a third missing Briton,Alec Collett, 64, who was seized March 25, 1985. His body was neverfound, however.   Fifteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon. Besides the threeBritons, they include nine Americans, an Irishman with dual Britishnationality, an Italian and a Belgian. The longest-held hostage isTerry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
