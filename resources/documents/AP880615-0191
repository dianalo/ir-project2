The 16-member drafting committee, chaired by Rep. William GrayIII of Pennsylvania, spent three days at Mackinac Island, Mich.,last weekend hammering out working papers on key issues.   Forces of Michael Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democraticnominee, and presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson were divided overwhether the platform should call for a freeze on Pentagon spendingand a tax increase on the wealthy. They did agree, however, tobrand South Africa a terrorist state.   Gray promised the participants Sunday they would get a chance tovote on a draft platform sometime before the full 186-member paneltakes up the document June 25-26.
