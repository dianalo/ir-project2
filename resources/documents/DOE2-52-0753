Bodyweights were reduced relative to sham-exposed rats for rats exposed to240 and 480 mg. hr Cu-Zn/cu.m week. All of the additional observed biologicalresponses to inhaled Cu-Zn were restricted to the respiratory tract.Lung weights were increased due to an inflammatory response for ratsexposed to 120 mg. hr Cu-Zn/cu.m or more per week. Exposure to 240 mg.hr Cu-zn/cu.m per week caused restrictive pulmonary functional disorder,as evidenced by a reduced lung capacity, reduced quasi-static compliance,reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and increased percent forcedvital capacity exhaled in 0.1 second. Exposure-related responses in lavage-fluidindicators of lung damage included increased beta-glucuronidase, increasedlactate dehydrogenase, and increases in inflammatory cells, total protein,and collagen. Histological lesions produced by Cu-Zn were atrophy ofthe nasal olfactory epithelium and hyperplasia of goblet cells in therespiratory epithelium, focal necrotizing alveolitis, alveolar macrophagehyperplasia, and goblet cell hyperplasia of bronchial and bronchiolarepithelium. The inhaled Cu-Zn alloy caused exposure-related inflammatoryand cytotoxic responses in the respiratory tract, but the inhaled Cu-Zncleared rapidly and the responses largely resolved after cessation ofexposures.</TEXT></DOC>
