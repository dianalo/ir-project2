(productannouncement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Markowitz, Michael C.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Cadence Design Systems Inc's Systems Div's XLP simulationaccelerator shows that software companies can sell proprietaryhardware.andP;  The XLP is easy to use, dispelling the myth thathardware accelerators are difficult to use.andP;  It has a capacity of1,000,000 gates that it uses to execute the Verilog-XL algorithmin hardware.andP;  It uses the software part to coordinate execution ofmixed-level, gate/behavior, simulations.andP;  Behavior models must besimulated in software because the accelerator simulates only thegate-level primitives.andP;  Two triple-height VMEbus boards that fitSun Microsystems servers make up the accelerator.andP;  Cadencejustifies the $85,000 price tag by pointing to similar tools fromother vendors priced in excess of $175,000.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Sun Microsystems Inc.
