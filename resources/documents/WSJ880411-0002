Sease (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO STK SCR </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jack Baker remembers the lights. Always the red, flashing lights.    Before Black Monday, the 43-year-old head of Shearson Lehman Hutton's institutional-trading desk reveled in the frenzy of shouting traders and the hundreds of blinking lights on phone lines to clients and exchanges. They would flash incessantly, from 8:30 a.m. until after the market closed.    But now, only minutes after the opening, less than a third of the lights are blinking. &quot;They're not exactly falling all over themselves to buy,&quot; Mr. Baker says. &quot;Wait and watch, wait and watch. That's what you do almost all day long now.&quot;    Nearly six months after the crash, Mr. Baker's impatient laments say a lot about Wall Street. Although it may be too soon to know whether the markets have been damaged fundamentally, they are certainly hurting: Volume is relatively thin, with foreign and domestic investors alike reluctant to jump back into stocks.    Many traders and money managers, still deeply shaken by how close the financial system came to collapse last fall, fear that another series of surprises could trigger another scary plunge. &quot;It could happen again,&quot; Mr. Baker says. &quot;That's the sword of Damocles we have hanging over our heads now.&quot;    Many firms have become very cautious, tightening trading restrictions and taking other steps to limit risk. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, &quot;the thinking now is meaner and leaner,&quot; says William Johnston, who heads Agora Securities Inc., a specialist firm.    But the economy is sending out different signals. In fact, it appears to be eerily disconnected from the markets. Recession fears have all but evaporated, at least for this year, and most economists expect further moderate growth. Basic indicators continue to gain, with unemployment at a nine-year low and inflation moderate. Even the dollar has rebounded a bit. Yet in recent weeks, the stock market has reacted oddly, often falling on bullish news or rising on no news at all. &quot;It's highly volatile, highly emotional,&quot; says Joseph Fuchs, the director of research at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    To many strategists, the manic swings add up to a bear market -- one &quot;that isn't finished growling,&quot; says Alfred Goldman, the director of technical market analysis at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. of St. Louis. &quot;I think we have more nasty times ahead of us.&quot; In most &quot;nasty times,&quot; stocks erode for months rather than crash.    Equally unsettling to some is that little has been done about structural and regulatory issues that the presidential panel investigating the crash felt were urgently required to prevent another one. The Brady panel's report emphasized the &quot;pressing need&quot; for cross-regulation of the stock, futures and options markets -- and for price limits and coordinated trading halts.    The Securities and Exchange Commission is trying to get the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures and options exchanges to jointly develop &quot;circuit breakers&quot; to interrupt trading during times of market stress. But since the crash, the exchanges have been more likely to publicly point the finger at each other rather than to cooperate.    Washington politicians, preoccupied with an election year, see little urgency or even need to move on market reform, absent another crash. Except for a few people such as William Proxmire, the retiring Senate Banking Committee chairman, even those inclined to act are wary of doing anything that might roil the markets. Nicholas Brady, the Dillon, Read andamp; Co. co-chairman who headed the presidential panel, concedes after lobbying some senators: &quot;Their minds aren't into this.&quot;    Also contributing to the market's volatility is a trend that few experts expect to fade quickly and that many see changing the stock market: institutional investors' increased impatience with companies that aren't producing short-term profit gains. The result is stepped-up turnover on &quot;behavior that is more typical of speculators than of long-term investors,&quot; says Anthony M. Solomon, the chairman of S.G. Warburg (U.S.A.) Inc. and a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. &quot;This brings into question the traditional role of the equity market in meeting the long-term capital needs of American industry.&quot;    Thus, for traders, money managers and investors alike, the past six months have brought little reassurance, even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average has regained 69% of the 508-point loss sustained Oct. 19. The average closed Friday at 2090.19, its highest level since the crash, but it remains far below its Aug. 25 high of 2722. Few market forecasters see a return any time soon to the giddy days of the five-year bull market. John Butler, the president of Financial Programs Inc., a mutual-fund group based in Englewood, Colo., compares his most bullish colleagues to &quot;kids whistling in a graveyard. They think if they keep whistling, maybe it won't happen again. But they're scared.&quot;    The bulls cite the good news, the perception that the economy's health has improved over the past few weeks. Some analysts, such as Mr. Fuchs of Kidder Peabody, figure that this is a &quot;muddle-through&quot; phase, not a bear market. David Dreman of Dreman Value Management Inc. agrees: With earnings healthy and most corporate debt under reasonable control, &quot;fundamentals can really support stock prices at this point.&quot;    Not everyone buys that optimism. &quot;It's Deja Vu All Over Again,&quot; is the Yogi Berra title of a recent report by Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. of Legg Mason Wood Walker. He compares the current market with that after the 1929 crash. Noting today's bullishness about the economy and the resurgence of mega-mergers, Mr. DeVoe is reminded of how a diver feels &quot;when all the reef fish disappear and you become aware of the complete silence, broken only by the escaping air bubbles. You get the feeling that you are not alone in the water, that 'something's coming.'&quot;    That something could be inflation. The economy's strength is stirring up inflation fears while chasing away recession fears. And interest rates have begun creeping up again. Some long-term Treasury bond yields, which dropped from nearly 10 1/2% last October to 8 3/8% at the end of February, have climbed back to 8.68%.    And Federal Reserve officials last week suggested that the central bank is reversing January's slight credit-easing move. They hope that a bit of medicine now to combat inflationary pressures and bolster the dollar will avert the need for a stronger dose later this year. But fears that interest rates may rise heighten investor worry about a possible replay of last October.    The bears note that since October, the market has had to deal with little bad news. But that vacation could end abruptly. &quot;There are so many things that can go wrong that it's hard to focus on any one thing,&quot; Shearson's Mr. Baker says. &quot;Everybody is waiting for the other shoe to drop. It could be the trade deficit, inflation, the dollar, South America or the bond market. Something is going to cause trouble, but you don't know what it will be.&quot; Mr. Goldman of A.G. Edwards sees &quot;more potholes out there than I can remember in my 28 years' experience.&quot;    However, many money managers and traders seem to be somewhat better prepared for potholes than they were six months ago. Mr. Johnston, the Big Board specialist, says that when &quot;volume was heavy and there was liquidity in the market, you could be long 70,000 shares {of a thinly traded stock}. But in this environment, you ask, 'Why the hell do I need to be long 70,000 shares unless I'm 80% sure the stock will rise?'&quot;    Thus, Mr. Johnston is reading more analyst reports, meeting more regularly with traders and other Wall Street sources, and &quot;continually prodding&quot; his staff to do the same. People are no longer &quot;so free and easy,&quot; agrees Christopher Chew, an investment strategist at James Capel Pacific Ltd. of Tokyo. &quot;The crash has made people look at fundamentals and earnings.&quot;    Fewer people are looking on &quot;portfolio insurance&quot; as a way to sidestep another market crash. This hedging strategy, which involves selling stocks or stock-index futures in a declining market, boomed in popularity before the crash; at least $60 billion was invested in it last summer.    But as the market plunged last Oct. 19, portfolio insurance generated &quot;huge&quot; selling pressure by sparking the sale of $6 billion of stocks and futures, according to the Brady panel. Even then, the strategy often didn't provide as much hedging as expected. As a result, its use has shrunk an estimated two-thirds since the crash.    At Shearson, Mr. Baker has imposed new restrictions on his traders who buy or sell stocks for big institutions -- pension funds, mutual funds, money-management firms and banks -- as well as for Shearson's own account. Before the crash, Mr. Baker didn't worry much about being caught owning the large amounts of stock that the firm routinely bought from customers when it couldn't immediately find other buyers. Shearson's traders usually could either come up with buyers quickly enough to minimize any losses or could chalk up a profit simply by holding the shares long enough. &quot;Pre-October, the tape would bail us out,&quot; he says.    Now, uncertain of the market's direction and frightened by its volatility, Shearson's big clients aren't trading so heavily. That has cut into commissions and has made it harder to find buyers for stock temporarily owned by the firm. And if too many clients are pressuring the firm to buy their blocks of stock, it can quickly become overwhelmed by the declining stock it holds. That's what happened to many big brokerage firms Oct. 19 and what Mr. Baker most fears will happen again.    The result: Shearson traders are being pushed to sell stock as soon as possible or hedge their positions quickly in the futures and options markets. The firm has also gotten a lot tougher on its clients, tightening up the list of institutions for which it will risk its own capital. &quot;If a client gives us {only} $26,000 in commissions each year, I'm not going to risk losing $250,000 for him,&quot; Mr. Baker says. &quot;I don't want to be in a situation where it takes 10 or 15 years of trading with a guy to get paid back.&quot;    To limit the risk, First Boston Corp. is simply raising the commissions it charges institutions for trades. Lon Gorman, a senior trader, says overall commission rates are up 20% to 25% since the crash. &quot;More often than not, our clients have been willing to up the ante,&quot; he says. The firm is also taking smaller positions. Before the crash, it would buy, say, 200,000 shares of a stock a client wanted to sell. Now, it might buy only half that, Mr. Gorman says. (First Boston has been under pressure from defections by key personnel and trading losses on mortgage-backed securities as well as from the stock market.)    At Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, Dudley Eppel, the head of block trading, says the firm is bidding lower for stock to offset its increased risk. Before Oct. 19, he says, it often bid for a block at a quarter-point under the market; now, it's bidding down one-half to three-quarters point.    Many traders are also worried by the thin trading volume -- a sign that buyers are hugging the sidelines. Last year, daily volume ranged from 163.4 million shares in June to 193.5 million in August, the highest except for the 277 million the month of the crash. This year, the daily average was 174.7 million shares in January, 184.7 million in February and 176.2 million last month. Included in those numbers is the brief ownership -- a day or less -- by Japanese institutions buying and selling large blocks of U.S. stock to qualify for quarterly dividends. That strategy generates big volume but barely affects prices.    By one estimate, that Japanese trading made up about 15% of Big Board volume during the first two months of this year. Subtracting that, trading by U.S. money managers may be off some 30% to 45% from a year ago, analysts say.    &quot;That's always a bad sign in a rally,&quot; says Justin Mamis, a technical analyst at Cowen andamp; Co. &quot;It's going to be death by boredom,&quot; adds James Chanos, an acknowledged bear who stands to benefit from the market's weakness.    Foreign investment in U.S. equities -- takeover raids aside -- has dwindled. After purchasing a net $26.2 billion during the first 10 months of last year, foreigners turned into net sellers of $9.7 billion last November and December. Stephen Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International, says that's because of fears, particularly by Japanese, that the dollar will keep sliding. &quot;If and when they come back,&quot; he says, &quot;they may think of bonds as a first opportunity.&quot;    Small investors also are skittish. That is dramatized by the drop in mutual-fund sales, particularly stock funds. In February, money flowed out of stock funds for the first time since October. The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group, says stock-fund sales plunged to about $5 billion in the first two months of this year from nearly $14 billion in the year-earlier period. Redemptions, meantime, edged up to about $5.2 billion from some $5.1 billion.    Individual investors &quot;realize that times of near panic are generally poor times to make investment decisions,&quot; says John Bogle, the chairman of Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. of Valley Forge, Pa. Mr. Bogle predicts that their nervousness could &quot;take years&quot; to overcome. Investor hesitancy, adds Howard Stein, the chairman of Dreyfus Corp., &quot;is heightened by the complexity of the market and the overwhelming number of choices to be faced.&quot;    Well aware of the problems, the Big Board is trying to reassure investors. To reduce price volatility, it has cut off access to its computerized order-entry system if the Dow Jones Industrials move 50 points up or down in one day. Technically, that doesn't ban program trading because big brokerage firms can tell their armies of floor traders to place such buy or sell orders manually. That happened last week when the Dow rose 64.16 points. &quot;It's a nuisance to write tickets, but it can be done,&quot; says one trader who did several $30 million trades after the 50-point threshold was pierced.    Now, the exchange is studying additional restrictions. The steps could include a complete trading halt if the Dow fell some as-yet-unspecified amount, such as 300 points. Some experts view this as merely an attempt to assure Congress that the market can regulate itself. In any event, the exchange says, nothing will be done &quot;for at least 90 days.&quot;    Many critics contend that steps such as price limits and coordinated trading halts could, in fact, increase volatility. Stephen Raven, a London stock-exchange official, thinks that such moves &quot;might provide a cooling-off period, but we have these every day when the market closes.&quot; The real question, he adds, &quot;is, How do you open the market up the following day?&quot;    Meanwhile, the anxiety grinds on. Even Mr. Baker, a respected, highly compensated manager, isn't immune to the paranoia. Whenever he is summoned to a meeting without knowing the reason or gets an unexpected phone call from a boss, &quot;the thought goes through my mind that maybe I'm out,&quot; he says. &quot;I know that's silly, but everybody is spending all their time thinking about the worst possible scenario.&quot;    ---   John Dorfman, Tom Herman, Kevin G.
