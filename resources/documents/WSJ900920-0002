At a meeting of interested banks held yesterday, Mr.Greenwald said the new offer would include $150 a share incash and leave 15% of the stock in the airline in publichands.   Financing for the proposed offer would include about $2billion in bank debt; $750 million in debt supplied byairline equipment vendors, possibly such as Seattle-basedBoeing Co. and the European aircraft consortium AirbusIndustrie; and $200 million in equity, possibly from aforeign airline, such as British Airways.   One person familiar with the transaction said that,although the banks' reaction to the terms of the deal wasgenerally positive, &quot;the problem is going to be getting overthe history of the transaction, the psychological andphilosphical factors.&quot; Two earlier versions of the buy-outhave collapsed in the past year.
