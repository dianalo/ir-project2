The Resolution Trust Corp. charged that Deloitte andamp; Touche,which is based in Wilton, Conn., caused at least $150 millionin damages in its audits of failed Otero Savings of ColoradoSprings, Colo., from 1983 to 1988. The suit was filed in U.S.District Court in Denver.</LP><TEXT>   The agency also filed a suit against KPMG Peat Marwick,New York, and its partners, seeking more than $100 million indamages in connection with the firm's audits of failed HillFinancial Savings Association, Red Hill, Pa. The suit,alleging negligence and breach of contract in 1986 and 1987audits, was filed in federal court in Philadelphia.   In separate actions, the agency also sought unspecifieddamages from directors and officers of Hill Financial, aswell as its law firm, Psaris andamp; Allen, of Red Hill, Pa.,alleging that some Florida real estate loans were madenegligently. No one at the firm was available to comment.   The suits are the latest in a barrage by federal agenciesagainst professionals who worked for failed Sandamp;Ls. The RTC,which liquidates failed Sandamp;Ls and their assets, has filedroughly 115 lawsuits involving about 70 failed Sandamp;Ls. Most ofthem are against directors and officers, and the rest areagainst accountants and lawyers.   A three-year statute of limitations is approaching forhundreds of Sandamp;Ls seized in 1989 during the first wave of thegovernment's restructuring of the industry. In the next fewmonths, the RTC lawyers are going to recommend to theagency's executive committee that roughly 100 more suits befiled, they say.   The suits involving Hill Financial allege that the thrift,following mergers in 1983, grew recklessly and made riskyloans for highly speculative real estate ventures. Appraisalsand other underlying documents for commercial real estateinvestments were outdated and inappropriate, according to theRTC.   The agency also alleges that audits in 1986 and 1987didn't fairly present the thrift's finances. Even after thethrift had been transformed from a home-mortgage lender to areal estate investor, the RTC said, &quot;Peat Marwick continuedto perform its independent audits as if there had been nochange in Hill Financial's lending strategy.&quot; Taxpayer lossesfor Hill Financial are estimated at $988 million.   A spokeswoman for KPMG Peat Marwick said the firm wassurprised by the suit. &quot;Our last audit report included adisclaimer,&quot; signaling there were problems with the company'sfinancial records, she said. &quot;We find the suit a little bitincredible,&quot; she added.   In the suit against Deloitte andamp; Touche, the RTC chargesthat the auditors intentionally destroyed their work papersfor the 1983 audit of Otero Savings, knowing that litigationregarding the failed institution was imminent.   The suit also alleges that Deloitte didn't require thethrift to set aside reserves for potential loan losses in1983 or 1984. The complaint suggests that if reserves hadbeen required, the thrift's capital would have been depleted,triggering a takeover by the government before it couldaccumulate losses. Those losses eventually totaled $195million for taxpayers.   A spokesman for Deloitte andamp; Touche said officials hadn'tyet seen the suit, and declined to comment. &quot;However, we knowof no legitimate basis for such a complaint against Deloitteandamp; Touche,&quot; a statement from the company said. &quot;Naming theauditors as defendants may well reflect the all-too-commonsearch for `deep pockets' to pay losses for which they haveno responsibility.&quot;   Last week, the Office of Thrift Supervision filed suitagainst Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hayes andamp; Hander, seeking tofreeze its assets and to require $275 million in damages forlosses associated with its work on behalf of failed LincolnSavings andamp; Loan Association. Settlement talks began late inthe week.</TEXT></DOC>
