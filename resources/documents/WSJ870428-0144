They would result in a lowering of the quality of medical care provided to our patients.    Part of the reason that the patients come to us as physicians is for our knowledge in evaluating their symptoms. Unfortunately, even a wise and skillful physician is not always able to diagnose the underlying disease simply on the basis of history and physical examination and is dependent upon further laboratory testing. A case in point was an elderly gentleman who was referred to me for evaluation of his stroke. There was no evidence of other disease. However, with the use of routine tests such as those that would be restricted by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield planned guidelines, we were able to diagnose, in addition to his stroke, underlying pulmonary tuberculosis, lung cancer, diabetes mellitus and Lues.    In working with medical students and young physicians in training, I try to explain to them that patients many times are like programmed learning tests -- if one does not ask a question, one does not receive an answer. The analogy is that if the tests are not ordered, other diseases may be overlooked.    John F. Aita, M.D.   Omaha, Neb.</TEXT></DOC>
