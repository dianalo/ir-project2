The Japanese auto maker has called a news conference for Monday, saying only that it will have a &quot;major&quot; announcement regarding its manufacturing operations in Georgetown, Ky., where the company is constructing its first independent U.S. assembly plant.    A decision to add an engine plant would come at an uncertain time in the U.S. auto market. After several strong years, U.S. car sales are softening and could be headed into a cyclical downturn. Last month's stock market crash, which left auto makers worried that consumers may cut their spending, may have accelerated that prospect.    Toyota, too, has been hurt by the softening market. The company has said it expects to sell about 932,000 cars and trucks in the U.S. this year, down about 9% from last year's record level. Sales next year could drop to between 875,000 and 900,000 vehicles, according to company forecasts.    Details about the engine plant couldn't immediately be learned, but Toyota, like other Japanese auto makers launching or expanding operations in the U.S., is clearly banking on the long term. Behind the flood of Japanese capital investment in the U.S. is a strengthening yen, which has taken much of the cost advantage out of building cars and major parts, like engines, in Japan and shipping them to the U.S. Auto analysts say it's now about as expensive for Japanese auto makers to simply build their vehicles in the U.S.    Politics is also motivating the Japanese, as rising trade protectionist sentiment in Congress worries importers. By moving production capacity to the U.S., the Japanese auto makers are taking steps to get around trade barriers that might be erected around the lucrative auto industry. In the interim, they can point to the fact that increasing numbers of the vehicles they sell in the U.S. are actually made by U.S. workers. Toyota says that so-called &quot;local content&quot; will make up about 60% of the dollar value of the cars it will make in Georgetown, including labor costs.    While Toyota's expected announcement about the engine plant may seem brash, given that the company hasn't even finished building its assembly plant, the company, in fact, is among the most cautious of the Japanese auto makers.    In contrast, much-smaller Honda Motor Co., the first of the Japanese companies to build cars in the U.S., already has a major assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio, producing Civics and Accords. Production there is expected to reach 320,000 vehicles this year and 360,000 in 1988. Honda also recently announced plans to build a second Ohio assembly plant and expand capacity at an existing nearby engine plant.    Toyota's announcement has been rumored for weeks in the Georgetown area, which is located about 15 miles north of Lexington, Ky. Auto analysts believe the project portends future expansion of the assembly plant there, which is scheduled to start production next year. Toyota says it will build about 200,000 Camry model cars a year when the plant reaches full production sometime in 1989 or 1990, but that generally isn't enough to warrant an engine plant, said Charles Brady, an Oppenheimer andamp; Co. analyst.    &quot;For 200,000 engines, they probably could have sent them over from Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;I see Toyota tipping its hand to probably expand capacity at Georgetown.&quot;    Toyota currently is using only about half of the 1,400-acre site it owns in Georgetown.    Toyota also is building an assembly plant in Cambridge, Ontario, which, at full production, will annually turn out about 50,000 Corolla model cars with 1.6-liter engines. Toyota already makes about 200 Corolla FX and FX-16 model cars a day in with General Motors Corp. at a joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif. The engines in both those lines are 1.6 liter.    Monday's news conference will be held in Georgetown. In addition to company representatives, Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins is scheduled to be present. Gov. Collins met last Monday with Toyota officials in Japan, but a spokeswoman for the governor said she was unable to confirm what was discussed. </TEXT></DOC>
