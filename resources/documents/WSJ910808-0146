But analysts expect bondholdersto balk at the company's current terms.   Walter Industries is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Robertsandamp; Co., the leveraged buy-out firm. Walter Industries filedfor Chapter 11 in December 1989, in what was then the biggestfinancial collapse ever of a company taken private in aleveraged buy-out. (Since then, other leveraged buyoutdebacles, notably those of Robert Campeau's retail empire,have surpassed Walter Industries.)</LP><TEXT>   When it filed for Chapter 11, Walter Industries citedcomplex asbestos litigation and an inability to meetcontractual interest-rate adjustment obligations on some ofits junk bonds outstanding. Most of the asbestos litigationremains unresolved, but federal bankruptcy Judge AlexanderPaskay has been urging Walter Industries to put forth atleast a tentative restructuring plan anyway.   Walter Industries, based in Tampa, Fla., has interests inhome building, coal mining and industrial-pipe manufacturing.The company was known as Jim Walter Corp. until early 1988,and then as Hillsborough Holdings Corp. until last month.   As proposed, Walter Industries would hand over about 20%ownership in the company to bondholders. The bondholders,meanwhile, are being asked to accept significantly lowerinterest rates on new bonds to replace the defaulted onesthey currently own. When Walter Industries entered Chapter11, most of its $1.2 billion in junk bond debt carriedinterest rates of 14 5/8% to 17%. The company is proposingthat bondholders take new securities yielding 11% or less.   Walter Industries will need to sweeten those terms to winbondholders' consent, analysts say. &quot;There's likely to be afight over distribution of the equity,&quot; said Kevin McCabe, ajunk bond analyst at R.D. Smith andamp; Co. &quot;Creditors are lookingfor majority control.&quot;   Portfolio managers at Fidelity Investments of Boston, oneof the larger bondholders, have also said in recent monthsthat they would like to see KKR invest more money in WalterIndustries if the buy-out firm is to keep a major ownershipstake. Officials at Fidelity didn't return calls yesterday;KKR declined to comment.   Details of Walter Industries' proposal began to seep outon Wall Street this week, even though the company hadsubmitted its proposal only to a few creditors' committeesand marked the terms &quot;confidential.&quot; Walter Industries owes$600 million in principal and accrued interest to a syndicateof banks and owes $1.37 billion in principle and accruedinterest to junk bond holders.   Secondary-market prices for the company's bank-debt, forexample, have surged recently, to as high as 72 cents on thedollar, bid, from about 60 cents on the dollar earlier thissummer. Creditors said Walter Industries is proposing torepay its banks in full, once it comes out of Chapter 11.   For the nine months ended Feb. 28, Walter Industriesposted a $688,000 net loss on revenue of $963 million.Earnings before taxes and interest expense totaled $176million. While Walter Industries is widely regarded as theproblem child in KKR's portfolio, its operating earningsstill are robust enough to cause several vulture funds to buythe company's junk bonds at distressed prices.   Creditors who have seen the Walter Industries term sheetsay it assumes that the company's liabilities on unresolvedasbestos litigation will be modest, if any. That position isdisputed by attorneys at Caplan andamp; Drysdale, who are handlingsome of the asbestos-related suits against Walter Industries.Lawyers for Walter Industries say they will ask Judge Paskaylater this year to dismiss the largest of these suits.Yesterday, a Walter Industries spokesman held out theprospect that the company's debt-restructuring terms maychange in the next two months. &quot;This is a first cut,&quot; hesaid. &quot;People should regard it as the start of moresubstantive negotiations with creditors.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
