Campbell was named president and chiefexecutive officer of Philip Morris USA, Philip Morris Cos.'domestic tobacco unit. The surprise move appeared to signalunhappiness with the performance and management style of EhudHouminer, the current chief of the tobacco unit.   Mr. Campbell, 46 years old, is currently senior vicepresident of corporate planning.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Houminer becomes senior vice president of PhilipMorris Management Corp. In that capacity, he will work on&quot;special projects of a strategic nature,&quot; according to astatement issued by the New York-based company.   A spokesman wouldn't elaborate and the executives inquestion couldn't be reached for comment. But the unexpectednaming of Mr. Houminer to his new post is a setback for the48-year-old executive, who made his name at Philip Morris bymasterminding the acquisitions of Kraft Inc. and GeneralFoods Corp. and the divestiture of 7-Up.   &quot;There is a major fear that for the first time in recentmemory Philip Morris USA will fall short of its unit volumeprojections, and the feeling is that Bill Campbell is a bitmore in tune with the ever-changing dynamics of thebusiness,&quot; said Scott Feit, director of marketing atCore-Mark Distributors Inc., the nation's largestdistributor. Until now, in an era when U.S. tobaccoconsumption is dropping 2% to 3% annually, Philip Morris hasbeen registering modest unit gains.   According to industry insiders, top management was alsounhappy with Mr. Houminer's decision to rush the company intodiscount brands, like Basic and Bristol, which in essencehelped fuel the growth of the bargain, or so-called subgeneric, category.   Tobacco distributors said that over the years the tobaccogiant had developed some very powerful relationships with thetrade and was known for its responsiveness to customers. Butsoon after his arrival in 1988, Mr. Houminer, who had nobackground in the tobacco business, began to engender illwill among distributors by his rigid approach todecision-making in the areas of credit and pricing. One movethat especially angered distributors was his decision toallocate tobacco shipments long in advance of the industry'stwice-a-year price increases.   In addition, Mr. Houminer managed to alienate companyemployees. In one small but particularly unpopular gesture,he eliminated the Secretary's Day perk of sending eachsecretary in the tobacco unit a dozen roses.   Analysts said the naming of Mr. Campbell would appear tosignal no major shift in strategy at the tobacco unit, PhilipMorris's largest operating division. &quot;This isn't a hugelysignificant development in terms of the strategic directionof the tobacco business, or the whole company for thatmatter,&quot; said Marc Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.   Earlier this summer, Mr. Campbell was credited withplaying a key role in the $3.8 billion acquisition of JacobSuchard, the Swiss candy and coffee maker. His previousaccomplishments included helping to launch Philip Morris'stobacco export business in the highly lucrative Asian market.While Mr. Campbell was executive vice president of marketingat the tobacco unit from 1983 to 1988, Philip Morris'sdomestic tobacco brands registered strong gains in marketshare.</TEXT></DOC>
