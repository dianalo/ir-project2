If present trends continue, census officials expect that half ofall Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010, and halfyounger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was 32.1,as of last July 1, the highest ever.   The 35-44 age group is the fastest-growing segment of the U.S.population, and the population segments aged 85 and over and 75-84rank second and third in growth since 1980, the Bureau said.   Combining to increase the median age of the population are thematuring of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and thatgeneration's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number ofbabies to pull down the numbers.   The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in1950, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop ofyoungsters to lower the numbers.   It took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990, 36.5 by 2000 and39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from theCensus Bureau.   Despite the aging of the population, however, the reportanticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline.   That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 comparedto the number of people of working age in between. The younger andolder groups are most likely to ``depend'' on those working.   The 1986 ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected toslip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing thenumber of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds tothe older group.   While there have been reports of increases in the total number ofbirths in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boomgeneration is largely in its prime child-bearing years. The rate ofbirths per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War IIperiod.   ``The repercussions of the Baby Boom are many and varied,''Census Bureau statistician Louisa Miller said. ``They will continueto affect the United States for many years to come.''   They are now at the age where they have more discretionary incomeand the effect can be seen in the nation's culture and marketing,she said.   The generation's arrival spurred a boom in sales of babyproducts. It then proceeded to overwhelm the school system,following up with creation of a national orientation toward teen-agemusic and styles.   Now, as the Baby Boomers set up more and smaller households, theyare prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods, marketingexperts say.   ``Further down the road, once they begin to reach retirement age,they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the countrytakes,'' Miller added.   The census projections show the Northeast remaining the oldestsection of the country, with the median age for that regionincreasing from 33.6 in 1986 to 40.3 in 2010.   The South will be second in 2010 at a median age of 38.4, up from31.4 in 1986. The Midwest will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the Westwill go from 31.0 to 37.4.   Florida will remain the state with the highest median age andUtah will still be the youngest state, according to the projections.   Florida, with a median age of 36.0 in 1986, will age to 45.3.Utah's median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only statewith a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuinghigh birth rate.   In the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but severalwere under 30, including _ besides Utah _ Alaska, Idaho, Louisiana,Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.   In 2010 not only Florida will have topped 40. Other states withmedian ages above that milestone will include Arkansas, Connecticut,Iowa, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
