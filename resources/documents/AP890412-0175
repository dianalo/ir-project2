ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oliver North testified Wednesday he thought hewas protecting President Reagan when he altered six Iran-Contra``problem memos'' before investigators from the attorney generalcould get a look at them.   Appearing pale and on edge in his fifth day on the witnessstand, North hotly denied he ``had been working in a den ofthieves'' at the National Security Council. And he said thedocuments he destroyed ``were only the tip of the iceberg''compared to those in the hands of prosecutors.   North said he was present, as the Iran-Contra affair was aboutto burst into public view, when National Security Adviser JohnPoindexter tore up a December 1985 presidential ``finding''retroactively authorizing a shipment of missiles to Iran in afailed effort to win the release of American hostages in Lebanon.   Poindexter's testimony on destroying the document _ making nomention of North's presence _ was one of the more startlingrevelations during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.   ``Where is the finding now?'' Prosecutor John Keker asked North.   A. I don't know.   Q. What happened to it?   A. I'm told it was destroyed.   Q. By whom?   A. Admiral Poindexter   Q. When?   A. Nov. 21-22-23 (1986).   Q. When did you learn Admiral Poindexter destroyed the finding.   A. I was there. I saw him tear it in two.   North said high administration officials did not want thefinding exposed. It would have been an embarrassment, North said,``because it looked like an arms-for-hostages swap.'' Reagan hadsaid often he would not negotiate with kidnappers.   Keker asked whether North knew ``it was the only version inexistence ... the only paper in the entire world'' with Reagan'sauthorization. North said he didn't know.   During the congressional hearings Poindexter said of thefinding, ``I thought it was politically embarrassing so I decidedto tear it up, tore it up, and put it in a burn bag behind mydesk.''   That same day, North said, Nov. 21, his former boss RobertMcFarlane reminded him to sanitize six notes which indicatedReagan's or McFarlane's knowledge of what North had done for theNicaraguan Contras.   North testified he had orders of a year's standing fromMcFarlane to alter the memos.   A list of the documents _ all memos he had sent to McFarlane onthe internal NSC computer network _ had been taped to his computerterminal that whole year, North said.   ``The gist of what he wanted removed from the documents waslanguage that would indicate his knowledge or the president'sknowledge about my activities in this time frame,'' North testified.   North had been coordinating efforts to sell arms to Iran and tohelp the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when the United States hadordered an embargo on weapons to Iran and Congress had bannedofficial aid to the Contras. Reagan has said he authorized sellingarms to Iran but didn't know of the diversion of some profits tothe rebels.   On Nov. 21, 1986, as the secret Iran-Contra dealings werebeginning to unravel in public, North told his secretary, FawnHall, to make the changes in the memos. This was a day before aidesto Attorney General Edwin Meese III searched North's office.   ``Mr. McFarlane asked me if certain things had been taken careof,'' North said. ``He asked me point blank whether it had beendone and I said, `No, not yet,' that I would get around to it.''McFarlane had left the National Security Council the previousDecember, but North said he felt he had to carry out the order.   ``I had been led to believe that everything I was doing was doneat the direction of the president,'' he said.   ``You had been told by the president of the United States todestroy documents _ explain how you had come to that conclusion?''Keker asked.   ``Because everything I had done that was described in thedocuments on this list I had been told was at the direction of thepresident,'' North replied.   North's testimony contradicts McFarlane, who said it was Northwho proposed making changes to the documents in late summer 1985.   Meanwhile, President Bush said he still considers North, adecorated Vietnam veteran, a national hero because ``anybody thatgets a Purple Heart, sheds his blood fighting for his country,deserves to be called an American hero.''   Bush has refused to answer questions about trial documentsconcerning his own involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, saying hedoesn't want to prejudice North's trial. He said again Wednesday,``The last thing I want to do is intervene in that matter that isnow before the courts.''   A document introduced at North's criminal trial this weekseemingly supported the idea that Bush, then vice president, knewin 1985 that Honduras was being rewarded for its support of theContras with additional U.S. aid.   The document, a Feb. 20, 1985, National Security Council draftmemo, bears the handwritten notation, ``We want VP to also discussthis matter'' with Honduran President Roberto Suazo, next to atypewritten section detailing the tradeoff.   A 42-page summary of Reagan administration Iran-Contra dealingwith other countries was introduced at the trial last week. It saidBush met with Suazo and told him about enhanced U.S. aid shortlyafter the arrangement was made for Honduras to help the Contras,but it did not say whether Bush knew of the connection.   Three of the 12 charges on which North is being tried concernthe altering of documents. Keker, like North a former Marine whohad served in Vietnam, hammered away on Wednesday at thecircumstances of the changed memos.   Earlier Wednesday, North blamed McFarlane for sending a letterto Congress that falsely denied the NSC staff was assisting theContra rebels in Nicaragua.   ``I wrote a number of other letters'' that were ``inconsistentwith the facts. ... I just simply do not believe I wrote thisletter.''</TEXT></DOC>
