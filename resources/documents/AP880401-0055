In the arts, Toni Morrison's novel of a former slave,``Beloved,'' won the Pulitzer for fiction, a category closelywatched after the book failed to win two other prestigious awardsfor which it was nominated.   Alfred Uhry's first non-musical play, ``Driving Miss Daisy,''won the drama prize and Richard Rhodes was awarded the non-fictionprize for his book, ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb.''   The Charlotte Observer, The Wall Street Journal and the MiamiHerald each won two awards.   The Knight-Ridder newspaper group won six in all, with theObserver's two, the Herald's two and one each for the PhiladelphiaInquirer and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. A total of 21Pulitzers were awarded Thursday for achievement in the arts andjournalism.   The Observer revealed misuse of funds by the PTL ministry``through persistent coverage conducted in the face of a massivecampaign by PTL to discredit the newspaper,'' the Pulitzer boardsaid.   The Observer's Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said the realreward was winning over readers who had denounced the newspaper'sefforts.   ``The thing that gratifies us the most of all about PTL are thefolks who have written us and said, `Two years ago, I wrote you andsaid you all were going to hell. ... Now, I want to say I'm wrongand keep up the reporting,''' Ethridge said.   The paper won the public service award in 1981 for its coverageof ``brown lung'' among textile workers.   The Miami Herald's Michel duCille won the feature photographyprize for photographs of the decay and rehabilitation of a housingproject inundated by the drug crack. He also won a prize for spotnews photography two years ago.   The Herald's humor columnist, Dave Barry, won the prize forcommentary for his ``consistently effective use of humor as adevice for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.''   ``It's fun to win a Pulitzer, everybody should do it,'' Barrysaid.   The Wall Street Journal's two prizes came in explanatoryjournalism and specialized reporting.   The paper's Daniel Hertzberg and James B. Stewart won forstories about an investment banker charged with insider trading andabout the day after the October stock market crash. Walt Bogdanichwon the specialized reporting prize for a series on faulty testingby medical laboratories.   Winners generally sounded giddy.   ``Several people in the newsroom just took a champagne bath,''said Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, whowon the prize in feature writing for her series on an AIDS victimin a farm community.   ``There was a lot of dancing and yelling and singing when theannouncement came over the wire _ but that's not unusual for theJournal newsroom,'' said Jim Tharpe, managing editor of the AlabamaJournal in Montgomery, which won in general news for itsinvestigation of the state's unusually high infant mortality rate.   The Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune also won in general news forstories that showed flaws in the Massachusetts prison furloughsystem.   Tom Shales of the Washington Post won the criticism award forhis writings on television.   Ms. Morrison acknowledged the controversy surrounding her bookafter it failed to win the National Book Award and the NationalBook Critics Circle Award last fall. In January, 48 black writersand critics signed an open letter deploring the lack of nationalrecognition of her book.   But the chairman of the Pulitzer fiction jury, RutgersUniversity professor Julian Moynahan, said jurors made theirrecommendations six weeks before the letter was published and feltno pressure to recommend Ms. Morrison's book.   ``I am glad that the merits of the book were allowed to surfaceand be the only consideration of the Pulitzer Prize committee,''Morrison said.
