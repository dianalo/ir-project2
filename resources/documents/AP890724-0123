(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The knife-scraped skeletal remains ofcannibal Alferd Packer's victims have been taken to the Universityof Arizona for study in an attempt to shed more light on the oldstory.   Packer came out of the Rockies near Lake City in 1874 and saidhe had subsisted on the remains of five prospecting companions tomake it through the winter.   The remains of the five were found later that year and buriednear here.   Anthropologists, who spent a week recovering the bones from agraveyard on Deadman's Gulch, said evidence already indicated thatone of the men had been shot and several of the bones had beenscraped with a knife. The scholars have taken on the challenge tosee if they can determine the real story through scientificdetection and see if Packer was wrongly convicted.   The recovery crew left Sunday with the remains.   Packer, who was sent to prison after being convicted ofmanslaughter in the deaths of each man, told authorities he shotonly one of the men and hit him in the head with a hatchet in selfdefense.   Packer said the man had killed the four others with a hatchet.   Wallace Birkby, curator of physical anthopology at theUniversity of Arizona, said a bullet hole was found in a rightpelvic bone Saturday, supporting Packer's story that he'd shot oneof the men in self defense. The bullet hole indicated that the manhad been shot from the front.   Birkby said two of the skulls were recovered almost complete andother damaged skulls would be reconstructed to see if they willaccount for at least a partial fifth victim.   Scrape marks on the bones of two skeletons indicated they'd beencut and scraped, or ``defleshed,'' Birkby said.   Punch marks found in a pelvic bone indicated an animal also hadeaten from one of the remains after the spring thaw of 1874, headded.   The project includes forensic anthropologists, a forensicpathologist and an expert on fibers and tool marks on bones.   Birkby said a laboratory study should indicate whether any ofthe scraped bones had been cooked over a fire.</TEXT></DOC>
