<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-0388 </DOCNO><TEXT>An important goal of the OPAL jet chamber is particle identification athigh momenta by exploiting the relativistic rise of the energy loss.Extensive tests have been performed with the full scale prototype ofthe OPAL jet chamber to measure the energy loss in an argon-methane-isobutanemixture as function of momentum and particle species. The measurementswere done under various operating conditions in order to optimise theoperationg point, to investigate sources of systematic errors, to monitorthe stability of the energy loss measurement and to develop calibrationprocedures. The particle separation capability in the region of relativisticrise has been studied at gas pressures of 3 and 4 bar. The adopted operationpoint represents a reasonable compromise between the requirements forparticle identification and tracking accuracy.</TEXT></DOC>
