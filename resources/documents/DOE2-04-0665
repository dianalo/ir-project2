Withhigh ash coals, slagging starts at a relatively lower temperature (e.g.if the ash content increases from 4 to 18%, the initial slagging temperaturefalls from 1070 to 1000 C). A high ash content produces slag with highfusibility and viscosity and hence there is a greater amount of slagformation. Slag formation increases in direct proportion to the contentof SiO{sub 2}/CaO in the ash. Thermal power plants with both fluid andsolid slag removal should have a monitoring system to separate out highash coal or average out the ash content of the coal to 6-12%. Efficientcleaning (water cleaning for the walls of the secondary furnace and gascleaning for the steam superheater) and reducing the load help to reduceslag formation. Also recommends the use of compressed air for dust removal.4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
