Kraft had said it planned to sell its profitable Duracelldivision, the world's leading maker of alkaline consumer batteries,to concentrate on its food business.   ``The sale price is fair and adequately compensates Kraft forthis fine business,'' Kraft Chairman John M. Richman said in astatement.   Henry R. Kravis, a partner in Kohlberg Kravis, called thedefinitive agreement ``the first step in the creation of a greatnew independent consumer products company.''   ``We are very excited about the future growth prospects of thecompany and our future association with the management andemployees of Duracell,'' he said.   Duracell, headquartered in Bethel, Conn., earned $53.9 millionon sales of $1.1 billion last year.   Kraft had 1987 sales, excluding Duracell, of $9.9 billion.   Kraft said it would use the proceeds from the sale to purchaseup to 12 milion shares of its own stock, to reduce its debt and to``be prepared'' for food-related acquisition opportunities.</TEXT></DOC>
