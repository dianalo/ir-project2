Several other companies, including New York-based Salomon Brothers Inc., denied that they have cut off or restricted their business with the company, as Texaco alleged in an affidavit that was part of its bankruptcy-law filing. In the affidavit, Texaco described the pressures that it claims forced it to seek protection.    Sources at some of Texaco's major banks said the lenders are still evaluating Texaco's position and remain cautious about lending to the company. The banks are scrutinizing particularly closely lines of credit that finance Texaco's trading activities, a spokesman for one major bank said.    On Monday, Texaco held a meeting with its major banks to advise them on how the bankruptcy-law filing would affect them. Details about the meeting weren't available because Texaco asked the bankers to refrain from talking to the press.    But an official for one large bank that does business with Texaco said that his bank is currently &quot;evaluating&quot; its position with Texaco. However, he added that &quot;there's no liquidity crisis at Texaco.&quot; The company is in a strong cash position and should reap a windfall of $1 billion a year because it doesn't have to pay dividends or interest on its debt, he said.    Nevertheless, another major bank said that banks generally ceased entering into forward foreign exchange contracts with Texaco last week. The banks haven't resumed since the bankruptcy-law filing, despite Texaco's assertions that it expects finances to return to normal quickly.    Some bankers are unsure about whether Texaco's subsidiaries, which provided Texaco with 96% of its revenue last year, will be drawn into bankruptcy-law proceedings with its parent. Currently they are excluded. Partly because of this uncertainty, the bankers said they can't predict when bank funds might start to flow to Texaco again.    Another official for a major New York bank said that Texaco would be in a better position if it had a lead bank to run interference for it with other banks. &quot;If Texaco had a lead bank to speak for it, it would have greater credibility within the banking community,&quot; he said.    Some of Texaco's suppliers also remain skittish. Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, said in an official statement printed in Caracas newspapers yesterday that it has taken &quot;precautions to protect its interests adequately&quot; since Texaco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, according to a wire service report.    Reports said that the Venezuelan oil company has imposed more stringent credit requirements in dealings with Texaco's various operating companies in the international markets, and that government purchasing organs have suspended dealings with Texaco until current legal questions surrounding the case are resolved.    A spokesman for the Venezuelan company said it won't ship Texaco additional supplies until after a scheduled meeting with Texaco next week to discuss new terms for financing transactions.    Since Texaco made its filing Sunday, Metallgesellschaft Corp., a unit of Metallgesellschaft AG, has been waiting for advice from its attorneys before it resumes business with Texaco, one of its major oil trading partners. &quot;We're nervous,&quot; said Siegfried Hodapp, president of the unit. &quot;Until we have a legal opinion, we would like to go slow.&quot;    New transactions will be considered on a &quot;case by case&quot; basis, Mr. Hodapp said. If Texaco wants to put up a letter of credit or cash, it is no problem, he added. While the Metallgesellschaft unit had no dealings with Texaco last week as its business deteriorated, previous business had been done on the traditional &quot;open account,&quot; where neither letters of credit nor cash was necessary.    Algerian and Saudi sources said yesterday that pressures on Texaco haven't prevented their oil industries from doing business with the beleaguered U.S. company.    &quot;There is no drama,&quot; said a senior Algerian official when asked if the country had stopped doing business with Texaco, one of its important clients. &quot;We have had a long relationship with Texaco, and received assurances that all agreements will be honored.&quot; But he wouldn't respond directly to Texaco's assertion about difficulties in dealing with Sonatrach, Algeria's national oil company.    Algerian and U.S. industry officials who asked not to be identified suggested that Texaco and its clients managed to keep business flowing &quot;more or less&quot; normally in recent weeks. &quot;No one wants to do any particular injury to Texaco,&quot; said a senior Arab oil industry official whose organization has extensive dealings with the company.    One official of Aramco, the Saudi consortium that sells Saudi Arabia's oil, said in a telephone interview from Saudi Arabia that &quot;nothing has changed for Texaco here. They continue to lift (oil) and there hasn't been any pressure on them to do anything special.&quot;    A spokesman for Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles said the company's Dallas-based ARCO Oil andamp; Gas Co. unit, which supplies Texaco with crude oil and gasoline, initiated an option several weeks ago under which it could require Texaco to provide a letter of credit if Texaco exceeds &quot;its average level of business&quot; with the unit. The spokesman said the unit hasn't yet required Texaco to provide a letter of credit, and that &quot;Texaco has informed us that they are financially viable and capable of meeting all their financial obligations to us.&quot;    He added that while the unit's prior dealings with Texaco have been &quot;on a credit-line basis,&quot; it will consider any new &quot;significant&quot; transactions with Texaco on a case-by-case basis as a result of Texaco's filing. The new arrangement doesn't mean, however, that the Atlantic Richfield unit will demand a letter of credit or all-cash transactions from Texaco, the spokesman said.    An official of Salomon Brothers denied the allegation in Texaco's affidavit, sworn by Texaco Senior Vice President Elton G. Yates, that Salomon's Phibro division had canceled an existing contract with the company. &quot;Any implication that we canceled a contract isn't consistent with the facts,&quot; said Robert Salomon, a managing director.    A spokesman for Tulsa, Okla.-based Citgo Petroleum Corp., a unit of Southland Corp., said he believed Texaco's characterization that Citgo &quot;threatened to cancel all business&quot; with Texaco is &quot;too doggone strong.&quot; He said that before the bankruptcy-law filing and until now, &quot;we continued to do business with them in a prudent business manner, as we have done in the past.&quot; He added that &quot;essentially nothing at this point has changed substantially in the relationship.&quot;    British Petroleum North America, an arm of the London-based British Petroleum Co., refused to comment on BP's commercial relations with Texaco. Texaco's affidavit said that BP refused an order for fuel on the ground that Texaco had exceeded its credit limit. A BP North America spokesman did say that Texaco offered to pre-pay for one cargo containing 14,000 barrels of fuel. &quot;We accepted their offer Monday,&quot; the spokesman said. Texaco said it has historically enjoyed unlimited credit with BP.    Texaco also alleged in its affidavit that a &quot;Swan Oil&quot; had changed its terms. A spokesman for Swann Oil, a Pennsylvania oil trading and marketing company that does business with Texaco, stated, &quot;I'm not aware of the company doing anything like that.&quot;    Some additional creditors also denied Texaco's statements that they canceled contracts or withdrew credit before the filing. And others said their demands for security or payment were routine requests made of any customers. None were able to confirm Texaco's overall account that it was being choked of vital oil supplies during the week preceding the filing. One large Texas oil company said, in fact, that its traders had noticed scarcely a ripple in the oil market last week -- partly because traders were repeatedly assured by Texaco traders that they would have no trouble getting paid as usual.    Responding to these denials, a Texaco spokeswoman said: &quot;What's at issue here is credit terms -- suppliers weren't any longer selling products under normal terms, but required cash or cash equivalent. Effectively, this made it impossible for Texaco and those suppliers to continue doing business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
