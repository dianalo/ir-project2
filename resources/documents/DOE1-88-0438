Sequential pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from100-450{sup 0}C generated organically-bound Ni and V complexes from theNew Albany and Woodford kerogens (determined by INAA), including Ni(II)and VO(II) porphyrins (determined by uv-visible spectrometry and highperformance liquid chromatography). Nickel and vanadyl porphyrins areassociated with the kerogen in a similar manner providing direct evidencethat kerogen is involved in the geochemical evolution of both metalloporphyrins.The Ni(II) and VO(II) porphyrins in New Albany shale bitumen-I and kerogenpyrolysates were investigated using liquid chromatography, thin-layerchromatography, and electron impact-mass spectrometry. Alternate porphyrinseries are generated form the kerogen, but the mineral matrix may alsobe involved in their formation and association in source rocks.</TEXT></DOC>
