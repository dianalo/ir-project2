Glasses of the compositionMe(PO/sub 3/)/sub x/, where x = 1 (Me = Li, Na), x = 2 (Me = Be, Mg,Ca, Zn, Sr, Cd, Ba, Pb), x 3 (Me = Al, Ga, Y, La, Eu), were objects ofthe study; trivalent europium (Eu/sub 2/O/sub 3/ - 2 mol.%) is the activator.For metaphosphate glasses, containing bivalent modifying elements, regularchanges of certain spectral-luminescence parameters of europium activatorions depending on the cation-modifier electric field intensity are detected.With an increase in the modifier field strength the degree of heterogeneityof the surrounding as to the variety of impurity ions increases and thedegree of activator-ligand bond covalency decreases. In the same sequencethe prohibition for radiation electrodipole transitions from Eu/sup 3+/ion /sup 5/D/sub 0/ level is intensified.</TEXT></DOC>
