<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0985 </DOCNO><TEXT>We present an algorithm which combines standard active set strategieswith the gradient projection method for the solution of quadratic programmingproblems subject to bounds. We show, in particular, that if the quadraticis bounded below on the feasible set then termination occurs at a stationarypoint in a finite number of iterations. Moreover, if all stationary pointsare nondegenerate, termination occurs at a local minimizer. A numericalcomparison of the algorithm based on the gradient projection algorithmwith a standard active set strategy shows that on mildly degenerate problemsthe gradient projection algorithm requires considerable less iterationstypically decreases by at least a factor of 10. For strongly degenerateproblems, the performance of the gradient projection algorithms deteriorates,but it still performs better than the active set method. 25 refs., 1fig., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
