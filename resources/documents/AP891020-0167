The decision to dissolve the Worker's Militia, the CommunistParty's private army, came less than two weeks after the partyrenamed itself the Socialist Party and committed itself topluralism and democratic ideals.   The Socialist Party, whose leadership is largely comprised ofthe same people who led the Communist Party, had backed a proposalto disarm the 60,000-member force but keep it as a civil defenseorganization.   The Socialist Party remains in power at least untilparliamentary elections due early next year. They are to be thefirst freely contested national elections since the Communistsconsolidated power in 1948.   ``The existence of the Worker's Militia ... is no longerjustified,'' declared Justice Ministry state secretary Gyula Boricsin introducing the legislation.   On the last day of the session, the house adopted two billsexonerating victims of political trials and other reprisals. Onebill rehabilitated all those convicted of revolutionary activityafter 1956 and pledged unspecified compensation to victims ofreprisals.   Earlier this year the government had already rehabilitated ImreNagy, the leader of the 1956 uprising, and several of his closeassociates.   A second bill also formally rehabilitated those victimizedbetween 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially consideredHungary's Stalinist period.   The house also overwhelmingly approved a proposal to declareOct. 23, the day the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising began, as a day of``national reconciliation.'' However, the house rejected a motionfavored by the opposition that it be made a national holiday.   Tens of thousands are expected to rally in front of ParliamentMonday to mark the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1956revolt. It will be the first time such a public rally is permitted.   In a statement issued Friday, the Socialist Party presidium saidit ``rejects'' the Soviet invasion that crushed the revolt andopposed all forms of intervention or interference in a country'ssovereignty.   Reforms enacted in the past year have put Hungary at theforefront of democratic change in Eastern Europe along with Poland,the only country in the Soviet bloc with a non-Communist-ledgovernment.   This week's session of parliament was dedicated to enactinglegislation designed to create the legal framework for next year'smultiparty elections.   Earlier in the day the body adopted an electoral law envisaginga modified system of proportional representation.   It also adopted a bill outlining procedures for electing anational president, but postponed a decision on when he would bechosen. The Socialist Party and most of the major opposition groupshad tentatively agreed on Nov. 26 as the date for a directelection, with subsequent presidents appointed by Parliament.   But some opposition groups, fearing the short campaign periodwould give the Socialist Party candidate an unfair advantage, havecollected nearly 200,000 signatures calling for a referendum on theissue. A minimum of 100,000 signatures is required to force aplebiscite. This issue is to be discussed when Parliament resumesOct. 30.   On Thursday, the house passed legislation permitting oppositionparties to field candidates in the elections.   The legislature also voted overhwelmingly to ban parties fromthe workplace, defeating an alternative proposal backed by theSocialist Party to allow party activity there. Politicization ofthe workplace has been a key element of Communist indoctrination.</TEXT></DOC>
