Pursuantto section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Act and EPA's implementing regulations,this approval results in the imposition of a moratorium on the constructionand modification of major stationary sources of CO and volatile organiccompounds (VOC) in the SCAB.

Background</ITAG>A brief background of the Act and the history of the SCAB SIP is providedhere. For a more comprehensive description of the relevant requirementsof the Act and EPA's regulatory actions on the SIP for the SCAB, see theproposed disapproval of the SIP for the South Coast and three other areasin California (52 FR 26431, July 14, 1987) and the General Preamble accompanyingthat notice (52 FR 26404). The Clean Air Act mandates a system of state implementation plans as thechief mechanism for meeting the NAAQS. Section 110(a)(1) directs the stateto submit, within nine months from the promulgation of primary NAAQS, aplan for implementing those NAAQS. Section 110 lays out the criteria forthe plan and provides a mechanism for revision of the plan where the Administratorfinds that the plan is substantially inadequate to achieve the NAAQS bythe relevant deadline. Recognizing that numerous areas had not been able to attain the NAAQS withinthe initial timeframe, Congress added Part D to the Act in 1977 which allowedcertain ``nonattainment'' areas to apply for time extensions to December31, 1982, with the exception that certain areas, in which it was ``notpossible'' to meet that deadline for ozone and CO, could apply for a furtherextension to December 31, 1987.California requested, and EPA approved, extensions of the statutory attainmentdate for the relevant pollutants in SCAB to December 31, 1987. The statethen submitted 1982 Plan updates for the ozone and CO SIPS in the SCAB.In 1983, EPA proposed to disapprove these revisions and impose a constructionban. 48 FR 5074 (Feb. 3, 1983). On July 30, 1984, after the state had submittedfurther revisions, EPA took final action to approve the CO and ozone controlmeasures submitted by the state, but held open the question of whetherto approve the attainment demonstration in the SIP submittal. 49 FR 30300,30305 (July 30, 1984).In September 1984, a citizen filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit Courtof Appeals for review of EPA's July 30, 1984 decision, contending thatEPA violated the Act by approving the SCAB control measures without determiningwhether those measures would attain the NAAQS by the statutory deadline(<T3>Mark Abramowitz v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </T3>No.84-7642 (9th Cir. Nov. 3, 1987)). In July 1987, prior to a decision inthat case, EPA reproposed to disapprove the ozone and CO SIP for the SCAB.52 FR 26408-26409 (July 14, 1987). In that notice, EPA stated that it lackedauthority to continue to defer action on the plans for those areas thathad not yet submitted a plan demonstrating attainment by the deadline,and that it had no choice but to disapprove the plans for those areas andimpose a construction ban under section 110(a)(2)(I). On November 3, 1987, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinionin <T3>Abramowitz, </T3>holding that EPA lacked authority to defer actionon whether the SCAB plan meets all of the Part D requirements of the actwhen the agency approved the individual control measures. The Court vacatedEPA's approval of the control measures and ordered EPA to ``disapprovethe relevant SIP provisions.'' Slip op. at 19. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Discussion </ITAG>Pursuant to the Ninth Circuit Court's instructions in <T3>Mark Abramowitz v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </T3>EPAis hereby taking final action to disapprove the SIP for the SCAB. As inthe case of EPA's July 14, 1987, proposal, the ground for EPA's final disapprovalis that it does not demonstrate attainment of the ozone and CO NAAQS byDecember 31, 1987, or even by any other fixed date in the near term. Underthe terms of the Act and EPA's regulations, such final plan disapprovalresults in the imposition of the construction ban in the South Coast AirBasin for major new sources and major modifications of existing sourcesof CO and VOC. Today's action is mandated by the Court's order, and is not an independentAgency final action based on EPA's July 14, 1987, proposal. The Court'sdecision establishes that EPA has no discretion under the law to postponethe final disapproval. Thus, EPA is not responding directly to public commentson the EPA's July 14, 1987, proposal. EPA may respond to some of the commentsin the future, perhaps in connection with EPA's final policy on how areaslike the South Coast should correct their SIPS after December 31, 1987. Under EPA's interpretation of the Clean Air Act 110(a)(2)(I) and 40 CFR52.24(a), EPA's disapproval of a Part D SIP triggers a ban on constructionor modification of major sources in the area concerned. However, Pub. L.100-202, signed into law December 22, 1987, prohibits EPA from imposingcertain sanctions under the Clean Air Act, including the construction ban,during a moratorium extending through August 30, 1988. Accordingly, whileEPA is today taking final action to comply with the Court's order, it isdesignating August 31, 1988 as the effective date for the constructionban.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Any major source for which the construction permit applicationis complete (as explained in 52 FR 26404, 26409 n. 18 (July 14, 1987))on or before August 30, 1988 will not be subject to the section 110(a)(2)(I)construction ban.<ITAG tagnum="28">EPA has historically read section 110(a)(2)(I) as exempting from theconstruction ban a source whose ``complete'' application predates the effectivedate of the disapproval triggering the construction ban. </ITAG><T3>See id.</T3> and 40 CFR 52.24(a). Under this practice, EPA's disapprovalof the South Coast Part D SIP would ordinarily result in a ban on constructionof any source whose permit application is not ``complete'' as of [thirtydays from publication], the effective date for the disapproval. However,Pub. L. 100-202 directs that no Clean Air Act 110(a)(2)(I) sanction shallbe ``imposed or take effect'' during the period prior to August 31, 1988in any of three circumstances, including a state's failure to attain theozone or CO NAAQS or to submit a SIP meeting the requirements of Part D.Accordingly, EPA's disapproval of the South Coast SIP does not constitutea prohibition on permitting of any source whose permit application is completedprior to August 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Final Action</ITAG>In response to the Court's order, EPA is today taking final action to disapprovethe ozone and CO SIP for the SCAB. Pursuant to the Administrative ProcedureAct, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), this disapproval is effective February 22, 1988.Pursuant to Pub. L. 100-202, the effective date for the construction banis August 31, 1988.Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major.'' It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review.Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA must assessthe impact of proposed or final rules on small entities. EPA does not havesufficient information to determine the impacts that the construction moratoriumannounced in today's notice may have on small entities, because it is difficultto obtain reliable information on future plans for business growth. Evenif this action were to have a significant impact, however, the Agency couldnot modify its action. Under the Act, the imposition of a constructionmoratorium is mandatory whenever the Agency determines that an implementationplan for a nonattainment area fails to meet the requirements of Part Dof the Act, and that determination, in turn, is required by the Ninth Circuit'sdecision.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial reviewof this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals forthe appropriate circuit by March 22, 1988. This action may not be challengedlater in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
