Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker on Capitol Hill inspired some dollar buying. But the currency's gains were limited by traders' long-term bearishness and the uncertainty over the Washington meetings.    The finance ministers are in Washington for the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Top finance officials from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France are expected to meet today for talks on currency rates, and they may be joined by their Canadian and Italian counterparts.    Many dealers predicted that no significant result will emerge from the meetings and that the dollar will resume its long decline next week.    &quot;We're just biding time, waiting for something to break,&quot; Paul O. Steinborn, a foreign-exchange adviser at BankAmerica International, said. U.S. and other officials have indicated that the talks will produce a reaffirmation of the Feb. 22 Paris accord, in which major industrial nations agreed to promote exchange-rate stability.    The absence of a significant agreement at this week's meetings would be a negative development for the dollar, Mr. Steinborn said. Other traders said that to avoid a resumed dollar sell-off next week, the finance ministers must at least reaffirm their February agreement.    What little action there was in the foreign-exchange market yesterday followed Mr. Volcker's remarks to a Senate Banking Committee panel. The Fed chairman warned of &quot;clear dangers&quot; in relying too much on exchange-rate changes to shrink the huge U.S. trade deficit, and he cited a possible resurgence in inflation. Mr. Volcker also said exchange-rate volatility could erode confidence in the stability of financial markets and could worsen Third World debt problems.    &quot;He took the dollar a little bit higher, as he usually does,&quot; Samuel F. Lek, a trader at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said of Mr. Volcker's comments. &quot;Nobody is going to sell dollars right while he's talking.&quot;    In late New York trading yesterday, the U.S. currency stood at 1.8275 West German marks, a slight advance from 1.8258 Monday. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar slipped to 145.60 yen from 145.93. The British pound was marginally lower at $1.6180, compared with $1.6183.    In early Tokyo trading Wednesday, the dollar fell to 145.33 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery climbed $3.70 an ounce to $422.20 in moderate trading estimated at 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $423 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ----                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Tuesday, April 7, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
