September 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Jesse Bogan, Airspace Branch (ATO-240),Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic OperationsService, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW.,Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267-9253.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">History</ITAG>On March 10, 1989, the FAA proposed to amend Parts 71 and 73 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Parts 71 and 73) to establish Restricted AreasR-6316 located near Eagle Pass, TX; R-6317 located near El Sauz, TX; R-6318located near Marfa, TX; and to alter the description of Federal AirwayV-13 located in the vicinity of El Sauz, TX (54 FR 10167). This actionwould allow the Customs Service to provide surveillance of airspace andto detect low-altitude suspect aircraft attempting to penetrate the airspace.The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the establishment of R-6316,R-6317 and alteration of Federal Airway V-13 also included the establishmentof R-6318. Preparations for the deployment of a tethered aerostat-borneradar system were completed earlier for R-6318. Therefore, the establishmentof R-6318 was set forth in a separate final rule action prior to the establishmentof R-6316, R-6317 and alteration of Federal Airway V-13. Only those commentsspecifically related to the establishment of R-6316, R-6317 and alterationof V-13 are listed since this document pertains only to R-6316, R-6317,and V-13.Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceedingby submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. Comments onthe proposal were received from the United States Air Force (USAF), theTexas Aeronautical Commission (TAC), and the Aircraft Owners and PilotsAssociation (AOPA).The USAF expressed no objection to the proposed establishment of R-6316,R-6317 and alteration of V-13.The TAC objected to the proposed location of R-6316, in the vicinity ofFarm and Market (FM) Road 1021, which would partially block a major VisualFlight Rules (VFR) flyway between Eagle Pass and Laredo, TX, along FM Road1021. The TAC was concerned with the separation of southeastbound aircraftand northwestbound aircraft both circumnavigating the proposed restrictedarea to the north since the southern boundary of the restricted area islocated adjacent to the United States/Mexico border. The TAC also expresseda concern that the aircraft circumnavigating the proposed restricted areawould possibly lose sight of FM Road 1021 during marginal VFR weather.Separation of opposite direction traffic circumnavigating the restrictedarea to the north would be maintained by aircraft adhering to hemisphericalaltitudes. While it is true that aircraft may lose sight of VFR landmarks,e.g., FM Road 1021, during marginal VFR weather while circumnavigatingthe restricted area, we feel reasonably comfortable with the idea thatpilots will be able to establish their aircraft on a heading or coursewhich would allow them to site the FM Road within a relatively short periodof time or distance.The TAC expressed a concern that pilots would be unable to determine theexact location of the aerostat balloon within each restricted area andthat the unlit tether cables of the aerostat balloons would be a considerablerisk for any VFR pilot flying through the restricted area. The restrictedarea is designed to completely contain the aerostat balloon and its cables,lighted or unlighted. We recognize pilots' desire to be able to see theballoon and its cable, but pilots must continue to be responsible to remainclear of a restricted area between the designated altitudes and duringthe time of designation for the restricted area, unless pilots have advancepermission to traverse the restricted area.The TAC recommended that alternate sites be studied before any final decisionis made on the exact locations for the aerostat balloons. Prior to theselection of a site for the restricted area, the Customs Service consideredseveral sites for the restricted areas. The sites selected for the establishmentof the restricted areas were determined to be the best possible sites forthe deployment of the tethered aerostat-borne radar systems.The AOPA requested that public hearings should be held to allow for userinput. Due to the nature of the aerostat program and security, the CustomsService felt that public hearings prior to the establishment of the aerostatrestricted areas would not be in the best interest of the aerostat program.The AOPA requested the aerostat balloons should not be flown prior to beingindicated on the aeronautical charts. The U.S. Customs Service is awarethat the aerostat balloons cannot be flown until the associated restrictedareas become effective and are published on the en route altitude charts.The AOPA made comment that the FAA should publish Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs)concerning the establishment of the restricted areas. The routine notificationprocedures for establishing restricted areas coincide with the en routecharting dates. This method of notification and establishment of restrictedareas has proven to be effective. Therefore, the FAA feels that publishingthe establishment of restricted areas in Class II Notices to Airmen inaddition to the routine notification procedures is not warranted at thistime.The AOPA requested that the Customs Service should place strobe lightson the aerostat balloons' tether cables. The FAA does not require the CustomsService to place strobe lights on the aerostat balloons' tether cableswhile the balloons are within the confines of the resricted areas. Also,the Customs Service feels that placing strobe lights on the aerostat balloons'tether cables would pose a dangerous threat to the aerostat balloons duringinclement weather, as well as a danger to operators when they retrievethe balloon during lightning activity.With the exception of that part of the notice which proposed to establishR-6318 and editorial changes, these amendments are the same as those proposedin the notice. A separate action to establish R-6318 was taken prior tothis action to establish R-6316, R-6317 and alteration of V-13. Sections71.123, 71.151, and 73.63 of Parts 71 and 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswere republished in Handbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule</ITAG>These amendments to Parts 71 and 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulationsestablish Restricted Areas R-6316 in the vicinity of Eagle Pass, TX; R-6317in the vicinity of El Sauz, TX; and amend the description of Federal AirwayV-13 located in the vicinity of El Sauz, TX. The U.S. Customs Service willdeploy a tethered aerostat-borne radar system at each location with thecapability of detecting low-altitude suspect aircraft attempting to penetratethe airspace at each location. The systems will increase the probabilityof the interception and interdiction of suspect aircraft and provide lowaltitude radar coverage for the Customs Service. In order to achieve theaim of the Customs Service, it is necessary to restrict airspace from thesurface to 15,000 feet MSL, within a 3-statute-mile radius of a point onthe Laughlin very high frequency omni-directional radio range and tacticalair navigational aid (VORTAC) 156anddegrees; radial, 64 miles from the VORTAC,for R-6316 and from the surface to 15,000 feet MSL, within a 3-statute-mileradius of a point on the McAllen very high frequency omni-directional radiorange (VOR) 307anddegrees; radial, 39 miles from the VOR, for R-6317. TheContinental Control Area is amended to reflect R-6316 and R-6317.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Parts 71 and 73</ITAG>Aviation safety, VOR federal airways, Continental control area, Restrictedareas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendments</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Parts 71 and 73of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Parts 71 and 73) are amended,as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
