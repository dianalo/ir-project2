(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eighty-year-old Edna Cooley has been waking upat 3 a.m. for nearly 22 years to trudge outside in occasionallybone-chilling cold and record the weather in the sparsely settledhigh desert of central Nevada.   Some 18{ hours later, Mrs. Cooley makes the last of her sixdaily weather observations and temperature checks for NationalWeather Service records on Austin, population 350, earning $11.10 aday for her troubles.   ``Why do I keep doing it? They say you can even get used tohanging if you hang long enough,'' Mrs. Cooley said. ``I've beenmeaning to quit for two years, but can't find anyone else to dothis.''   She is among the last of a breed of hands-on recorders of thenation's highs, lows and precipitation amounts. Without theobservers, meteorologists and forecasters would have a moredifficult time predicting the weather.   ``There's a need for live observation,'' said Gerald Miles, ameterologist in Elko who supervises the weather watchers.``Equipment is reliable, but you need good remarks from observersto go with it. Equipment has its limitations.''   Bill Davis, the Salt Lake City-based western regional directorof the observation program, said about 50 weather watchers are onthe National Weather Service payroll in his jurisdication.   Several hundred others, mostly farmers, voluntarily reportclimate information to the agency to help keep a historical weatherrecord.   Davis said at-home weather observation stations were set upduring World War II ``basically wherever they could find someoneand where we didn't have a government office.'' Meteorology wasrapidly developing, and officials found ``eyeball-type''information improved their ability to track storms, he said.   The observers must pass a certification test and use weatherservice equipment to take measurements of temperature, winds, dewpoint, atmospheric pressure and precipitation. The routine can take10 to 15 minutes, depending on the weather.   ``There's no grand plan to get rid of the weather observers,''Davis said. ``I think they'll be around for the next decade. Butwe'll lose some to equipment and because people will retire and theyounger generation doesn't want to work that hard for so littlemoney.''   Mrs. Cooley said that when she goes on vacation, ``there's noweather coming out of Austin. The TV stations just say, `Oh well, Iguess that Edna's out of town again.'''   Debi Gill, who usually reports Nevada's coldest overnight lowsat Wildhorse Reservoir just south of the Idaho border, has been anobserver for 3{ years.   ``Sometimes, I wonder why I keep doing it, especially at 5:30 inthe morning,'' she said.   Mrs. Gill, like other weather observers, gets $2.50 for thefirst early morning recording, $1.60 for daytime readings and $1.90for each night observation.   She said the most frightening thing about the job is thelate-night readings when near silence fuels the imagination, shesaid.   ``When the lake is frozen over the ice groans and the coyotesare yipping and howling, I just get all nervous,'' said Mrs. Gill.``It's silly, but I get scared of the bogyman because that's theonly one who would be out that time of night.''   The good part of the job is closely watching how nature worksand stopping to enjoy the surrounding weather, sunrises andsunsets, she said.   ``Not many people stop and watch the sky,'' she said. ``Theclouds actually grow, puff up right before your eyes. It'swonderful.''   Observers must distinguish among three layers of clouds withnine different basic cloud types possible at each level.   Susan Deming, who has been observing the weather in BattleMountain in north-central Nevada since May, said people sometimesstop her on the street or telephone her asking what the weatherwill be like or with weather-related inquiries, such as whether itis too soon to plant.   ``I have to tell them I don't predict the weather; I justobserve it,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
