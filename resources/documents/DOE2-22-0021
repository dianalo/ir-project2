For fusion energy, damage due to high energy neutrons is important.For waste materials, finally, {alpha}-decay is the predominant sourceof atomic damage. The present paper serves also as introduction to aworkshop on radiation damage in these waste matrices. Damage productiondue to the above sources in nuclear materials is reviewed, damage effectson physical properties of interest for technological applications aresummarized, and new results are given on damage ingrowth in nuclear fuels.Emphasis is placed on ceramics for waste solidification and on nuclearfuels, since waste glasses are treated in detail in subsequent papersof the workshop. For the case of waste ceramics, large volume increases,formation of amorphous phases (metamictization) due to ion implantationor {alpha}-decay are observed leading to increased leach rates. A positivefeature of damage is a generally observed increase of fracture toughnessin the damaged state. Damage effects in the tailormade ceramic SYNROC(synthetic rock) developed in Australia are also described based on theabove sources (ion implantation and {alpha}-decay of an incorporatedactinide of high specific activity, Cm-244) for damage production. Inaddition, first channeling/Rutherford backscattering results on damagein the U sublattices of UO/sub 2/ and UN due to ion implantation withfission product ions are given, determining the number of displaced Uatoms per incident ion, as well as the spontaneous and the thermal recoveryof the defects produced. In conclusion, it is shown that a good understandingexists of radiation damage effects in nuclear materials, both for fuelsand for waste matrices. Some remaining open questions are pointed out.</TEXT></DOC>
