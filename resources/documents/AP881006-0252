The publishing giant's board, as expected, urged shareholdersWednesday to reject a $2.51 billion tender offer from Britishpublisher Robert Maxwell.   Macmillan previously agreed to a $2.5 billion buyout proposalfrom a group led by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. and including Macmillan senior management.   Macmillan stock rose 25 cents a share to $88.62{ in consolidatedNew York Stock Exchange trading. That was slightly below Kohlberg'slatest offer of $90.05 in cash and securities for each ofMacmillan's 27.8 million shares. Maxwell's latest offer is $90.25 ashare in cash.   ``I don't think the rejection makes much difference,'' said J.Kendrick Noble, a media analyst for the investment firm PaineWebberInc. ``A recommendation from the board can't stop an alternativebid.''   Noble said ``the key issue now is in the courts.''   Maxwell's tender offer is set to expire Oct. 13, whileKohlberg's offer expires 24 hours later.   Maxwell already had filed suit in Chancery Court in Delaware,charging that the bidding process was unfairly skewed in favor ofthe management bid. A hearing on the complaint was scheduled forMonday.   Macmillan said its board decided to recommend that shareholdersreject Maxwell's offer because it contained several conditions,including invalidation of the ``legal and binding contractualobligation'' with the Kohlberg group.   Early last week, Macmillan gave both Maxwell and Kohlberg achance to make final offers for the company. At the time, Maxwellwas offering $86.80 a share in cash, while Kohlberg had offered $85a share in cash and securities.   Maxwell boosted his offer to $89 a share in cash.   But Macmillan agreed to a subsequent Kohlberg offer of $90.05 ashare in cash and securities, and promised to sell the group fourof Macmillan's businesses for $865 million should its merger not beconcluded. They are the Berlitz language centers, the directorydivision, the direct marketing division and a division thatpublishes state legal codes.   Maxwell subsequently boosted his offer to $90.25 a share incash, subject to, among other things, elimination of the agreementto sell the four businesses.   As an alternative, Maxwell said he would pay $900 million forthe four businesses that Macmillan agreed to sell to Kohlberg andto drop his tender offer.   Maxwell said in court papers filed Wednesday that MacmillanChairman Edward P. Evans had told Kohlberg what Maxwell's final bidhad been, enabling Kohlberg to top Maxwell's bid and demand the``lockup option'' on the four businesses.   Maxwell also said the sale of the four businesses had beenstructured in a way to discourage any bids for the remainder of thecompany by exposing Macmillan to a $250 million tax liability onthe sale.   A spokesman for Macmillan said the communication from Evans tothe Kohlberg group was appropriate. Spokesman David Jackson saidMaxwell's advisers could have asked, in setting the ground rulesfor the auction, that their final bid be kept secret, but failed todo so.   Macmillan has been embroiled in a takeover fight since mid-Maywhen a group led by the Texas financier Robert M. Bass proposed abuyout at $64 a share. Bass has since dropped out of the bidding.</TEXT></DOC>
