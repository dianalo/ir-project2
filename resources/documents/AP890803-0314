Genson has two clients indicted in the first wave, but anothertwo dozen have retained his services because they expect to beindicted. His skepticism about the charges is shared by others.   ``What is being alleged is serious from the point of view ofrule-breaking at the exchanges. But as far as massive amounts ofmoney being stolen from customers _ that just hasn't been shownyet,'' said Daniel Siegel, a futures market specialist andassistant professor of finance at Northwestern University.   ``People knew what was coming when the investigation was firstrevealed,'' he added, ``and quite frankly, I don't think peoplewill stop using these markets as a result.''   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the charges were partof ``a crackdown on white-collar crime in all its various guises,from Wall Street to (Chicago's) LaSalle Street to Main Street andall stops in between.''   Prosecutors charge that a variety of illegal schemes took placeat the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchangeduring the 2{-year undercover investigation, all to the detrimentof customers.   Thornburgh's presence at the news conference announcing theindictments _ which ranged from mail and wire fraud to racketeeringfor allegedly bilking profits from hundreds of customers _ lent acertain weight to the proceedings.   But Anton Valukas, U.S. attorney for the Northern District ofIllinois, sais the alleged activity involved hundreds of customersand thousands of trades, but he declined to place a dollar amounton the fraud other than to say it was significant.   Defense attorneys and traders suggested a deeper look into theindictments themselves reveal few significant abuses actually tookplace.   They acknowledged that a handful of traders likely made largeprofits through illegal trades, but also hinted that motives otherthan a serious desire to fight crime may have driven some theinvestigation.   Just hours after the indictments were announced, a Housecommittee approved legislation reauthorizing the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission, the federal agency that regulates the commodityfutures exchanges.   The legislation, approved by the Agriculture Committee, wouldgrant permanent regulatory authority to the CFTC, which Congresshas reauthorized on a temporary basis every three or four yearssince the agency was created in 1974.   The measure, which now goes to the full House, also would imposerestrictions on trading practices such as dual trading that havecome under criticism following disclosure of the commodities probe.   ``There are a few practices that they want to choke out of themarkets,'' said one trader who spoke on the condition of anonymity,``and nobody _ the exchanges or the regulators _ has the guts to doit.''   Among the market practices the trader identified were the``open-outcry'' system and dual trading, both of which lendthemselves to abuse by dishonest traders.   Under open-outcry, traders shout orders and wave hand signals toeach other in the free-for-all auction of contracts. Dual tradingallows a client to trade for his own account as well as hiscustomers'.   ``I'm not sure there was an ulterior motive, but theprosecutorial mentality assumes that if a person can do something,immoral or illegal, they will,'' said Genson.   Siegel, like several defense attorneys interviewed Wednesday,predicted a second wave of indictments would follow as more tradersat the CBOT and Merc are persuaded to cooperate with the government.   But unlike most of the defense attorneys, he found something tobe encouraged about.   ``I doubt if getting rid of the open-outcry system is what thefeds had in mind with the indictments, but people have beencomplaining about it for a long time,'' he said.   ``What this might do is enable the exchanges to overcome theresistance out there and quiet the cries about accountability bymoving to electronic trading. That is the big battle just over thehorizon, the fight to be the pre-eminent futures market and theinternational competition is ferocious,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
