<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0290 </DOCNO><TEXT>Twelve triaxial compression creep tests were performed on salt specimensfrom the Woods-Holtzclaw well in the Palo Duro Basin to assess the influenceof impurities on creep deformation. Four nominal impurity levels wereinitially selected for investigation: pure salt, salt containing 10%anhydrite, salt containing 10% mud, and salt containing 20% mud. Subsequentpetrological measurements show these idealized categories do not exist.Composition of the samples was measured by methods of wet chemistry coupledwith ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) digestion and point countingon full-size polished sections. Overall, the 12 specimens comprise 71.6--96.6%halite, 2.4--7.5% anhydrite, and 0.2--24.7% clay. Nine of the 12 specimensare similar to many other tested specimens from the Lower San AndresUnit 5. They range from 90--97% halite and average 94% with a standarddeviation of 2%. The remaining 6% impurities are disseminated clay andanhydrite. The other three specimens from the Lower San Andres Unit 4contain large amounts (average 20%) of uniformly distributed clays andaverage only 75% halite. 11 refs., 21 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
