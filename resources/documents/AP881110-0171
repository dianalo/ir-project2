Thomas Murry, an employee of a U.S. aviation company, was thesecond American witnesses to testify Thursday at the trial ofMohammed Ali Hamadi, who admitted taken part in the June 1985hijacking.   ``The whole thing (hijacking) was like a theatrical performance,a well-rehearsed play, in which something had gone wrong, they couldnot follow the preferred script,'' Murry said.   Murry, 61, said watching the hijackers ``running up and down theaisle'' of the airplane ``was as if they weren't prepared for anaircraft with a door at the back.''   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and airpiracy in the hijacking of TWA Flight 847. U.S. Navy diver RobertStethem was killed, and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 daysduring the ordeal.   Hamadi has has denied killing the 23-year-old sailor.   Earlier Thursday, another former hostage said he feared thatsomeone on the airplane might attempt to overpower the terroristsand cause them to set off a hand grenade they were carrying.   ``I had a fear that someone would try to attack the hijackers andthey would drop the grenade,'' said Robert Trautmann, a 40-year-oldreal estate developer.   Trautmann also spoke of the brutal beatings of passengers duringthe hijacking, as have many witnesses since the trial began July 5.   ``I heard the beatings and screams in the front of the plane,''he told the court, saying that at one point ``I feared I would bekilled.''   Neither Murry or Trautmann said where he was from, underguidelines set by the court to protect witnesses' security. At thetime of the hijacking Trautmann lived in Laredo, Texas, and Murry inValencia, Calif.   Hamadi often looked back to the spectator section where hisparents, Ali Hassan and Fatima Hamadi, were sitting.   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, also attendedthe session, as they have done regularly since the trial opened.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, aftercustoms officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.</TEXT></DOC>
