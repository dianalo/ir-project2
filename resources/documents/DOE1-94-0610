Between1950 and 1985, the efficiency level in the utilisation of coal was improvedfrom 0.580 to 0.313 kg/kWh. Sales to remote district heating grew by30% over the last ten years. Cogeneration unit plants use about 30% lessfuel than conventional coal-fired power stations, but the requirementfor their use is restricted. In mid-1985, there were up to 266 cogenerationunits in operation in Germany with a total output of 157 MW. Wind energyis utilised in Germany in four larger plants (3740 kWh) and 28 smallerones (20 to 60 kWh; total capacity 800 kWh). Approximately 1% of thepower fed into the national grid in 1985 came from refuse incinerationand sewage treatment plants. Electric power from solar energy via solarcells would cost about 3 DM per kWh including storage costs. A numberof small solar cell installations are being operated experimentally bypower utilities.
