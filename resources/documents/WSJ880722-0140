Mr. Hurtado said Venezuelan officials will travel to Washington and New York this month to &quot;initiate conversations with private banks.&quot;    Mr. Hurtado, who said in an interview last month that Venezuela would seek &quot;not less than $2 billion&quot; in new bank loans, didn't specify yesterday how much Venezuela would seek or in what form. &quot;We will present them {the banks} with a menu of options and see which dish they like best,&quot; he said.    Last year, Venezuela signed a $20.34 billion restructuring that covered nearly all the country's medium-term and long-term foreign bank debt. </TEXT></DOC>
