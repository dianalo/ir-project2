Grain prices are being supported and gold prices pounded,but other markets are affected too. As winter approaches, theneeds and actions of the Soviet Union -- the world's largestoil producer and third-largest gold producer -- figures moreand more prominently in commodity traders' moves:</LP><TEXT>   -- Soviet pleas for massive amounts of Western food aidare reviving U.S. grain and soybean markets. For instance,some traders say increased exports could help push cornprices above $3 a bushel by next summer, roughly 20% abovecurrent levels.   -- The plunge in gold prices, meanwhile, is being fed byfears that aid won't come in time and that the Soviets willbe forced to sell massive amounts of gold to buy food. &quot;Thewhole Russian situation has clearly panicked the market,&quot;says Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase ManhattanBank.   -- Oil markets are calm for the moment, but if Sovietexports -- currently two million to 2.5 million barrels daily-- continue to wane as expected, some analysts see tightenedpetroleum supplies this winter and firming prices.   So far, though, grains and soybeans have reacted the most.Soybean prices at the Chicago Board of Trade have climbedroughly 7% since the failure of last month's coup attemptagainst Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Wheat is up 6%,and corn is resisting the seasonal plunge that usuallyaffects all the grains. Trading activity has picked up.   The Soviet Union is one of the biggest -- and mostunpredictable -- customers of the U.S. farmer. In a busyyear, roughly one of every 15 bushels of grain leaving theU.S. ends up in the Soviet Union. In a slow year such as1990, when credit problems and a big Soviet harvest promptedMoscow to cut its U.S. business by 37%, the grain pits gointo a deep funk.   For that reason, it's little wonder that the prospect offood aid to the Soviets has helped cause one of the sharpestshifts in market psychology in years. Just two months ago,U.S. crop prices were sliding toward levels not seen sincethe farm recession of the mid-1980s.   Then a scattered drought began trimming Midwest cropforecasts. U.S. stockpiles of corn, wheat and soybeans arenow expected to shrink to tight levels by late next year evenif U.S. exports remain sluggish.   And U.S. grain exports to most countries for next yearstill do look weak. But projections that the Soviet harvestwill be down at least 20% from last year are causing someWestern analysts to estimate that Moscow might need to importa total, from all sources, of 40 million metric tons ofgrain. That's a quantity roughly equal to the entire cornoutput of Iowa, the top corn-producing state in the U.S.   To help Moscow pay for it, traders speculate that theWhite House will offer the Soviets more than the $2.5 billionin bankloan guarantees already in place. As a result, graintraders are now worrying about too little supply, instead ofweak demand.   By next year, according to some analysts, a major graindeal with the Soviets and more bad weather in the Midwestcould force corn prices up to the $3-a-bushel mark.   That possibility is rattling the cattle futures market,because a jump in the cost of the corn that's fed tolivestock could slow the expansion of the U.S. herd.   But others doubt that a big grain boom will occur-a factthat puts a lot of traders on edge. &quot;Potentially, this is avery volatile market,&quot; said Bill Biedermann, vice presidentof research at Allendale Inc., Crystal Lake, Ill.   A major question is whether U.S. loan guarantees areenough to persuade wary commercial banks to extend credit tothe Soviet Union. The Agriculture Department is backing 98%of the principal of grainbuying loans to the Soviets. ButSoviet economic woes and the breakup of the centralgovernment, which is responsible for the loans, has banksworried that they'll lose the other 2%.   The banks, which are going through their own convulsions,want Washington to reduce their risks even further. It isn'tclear what the Agriculture Department might do, as sweeteningthe loan program or offering direct aid might requirejuggling the federal budget.   Meanwhile, gold traders are anxiously watchingdevelopments in both the grain markets and Washington, asfears mount that the Soviet economic crisis will lead to biggold sales by Moscow to buy food.   Also weighing heavily on the gold market is the fate ofmillions of ounces of gold held as collateral in gold swaps-- arrangements to sell gold for hard currency with a promiseto buy the gold back later at previously set prices. Tradersfear that the Soviets won't have the cash to buy the goldback, forcing the dealers to dump the gold on the market. Anestimated five million to eight million ounces of gold isheld as collateral in swaps.   Mr. Mehta of Chase Manhattan, however, says the Soviets sofar have been scrupulous in meeting their obligations underthese swaps, giving reason to hope they will continue to be.   A wave of selling sent spot gold prices down as far as$341 an ounce this month, and some analysts predict thatprices will, after a brief recovery, resume their decline tothe low $300 range and perhaps lower. On the CommodityExchange in New York Friday, gold for current deliverysettled at $348.50 an ounce, up 20 cents.   Soviet officials aren't willing to take the blame fordeclining gold prices. Eugene Uljanov, head of the Bank forForeign Economic Affairs office in New York and former headof gold trading in Moscow, says he hears rumors about howSoviet selling is affecting the gold market. Although hedoesn't know the bank's trading activity minute by minute, hesays, &quot;Normally our policy is not to disturb the marketprice.&quot; Soviet traders are sophisticated and professional, hesays: They sell when prices are rising and buy duringdeclines.   Other Moscow officials of the bank have blamed gold's dropon &quot;rumors designed to provoke panic on the internationalmarket&quot; and have pointed fingers at the speculativeactivities of a bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Rumors citingthe Soviet economic difficulties are just a cover for thisspeculation, one official reportedly told the Soviet newsagency Tass.   Some market players agree that fears of huge Soviet goldsales are exaggerated and say the amount sold from the SovietUnion this year doesn't appear unusually high. Some expectthe price to recover if the Soviet Union discloses, in thecourse of seeking Western economic aid and applying to jointhe International Monetary Fund, that it has less gold in itsreserves than outsiders have believed. Fears also will becalmed if Western assistance allows the Soviets to meet theirfood needs through credit arrangements rather than goldsales.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          A nascent squeeze on holders of short positions in theSeptember contract is expected to continue buoying pricesthis week.   On Friday, copper for September delivery jumped 3.1 centsa pound to $1.1010; the actively traded December contractrose 2.2 cents to $1.0540. The premium of the Septembercontract over December has widened to nearly five cents fromone cent a month ago.   Analysts and traders attributed the rise to what appearedto be the start of a squeeze on the September contract, whichexpires this week.   Mike Frawley, metals trader at Dean Witter, said warehousestocks at New York's Commodity Exchange were about 28,000tons, while the September contracts outstanding representabout 42,000 tons. Traders with short positions, or bets thatthe price will fall, are bidding up prices to buy offsettingcontracts and avoid having to deliver the metal.   The &quot;shorts&quot; can't easily get copper elsewhere. FredD'Agostino, executive vice president of Tangent Trading Corp.in Greenwich, Conn., said that U.S. producers of refinedcopper are sold out for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, hesaid, wire mills have seen a slight increase in business andare turning to copper merchants, who lock in supplies bybuying futures contracts and taking delivery.   In addition, expectations of lower production from Zaireand the Soviet Union are fueling concerns about short-termsupplies, said William O'Neill, futures strategist at MerrillLynch.                                                                                                          Cotton                                                                                                          The weather in Texas will continue to affect cottonmarkets this week. Relatively cold, wet conditions willcontinue in West Texas, predicts Joel Burgio, meteorologistat Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass.   Dale Parr, associate director of commodities of the TexasFarm Bureau in Waco, said the recent bad weather has slowedthe cotton crop's maturity and is likely to reduce yields.   Wet weather in central Texas also is delaying the harvestand is hurting yields by causing the cotton to fall to theground, Mr. Parr said. One farmer reported he may have lost50 pounds of cotton an acre, out of a potential yield of 600to 700 pounds, because of the wet weather, Mr. Parr said.   On Friday, cotton for October delivery ended 0.69 cents apound higher at 66.07 cents; the actively traded Decembercontract gained 1.92 cents to 67.66 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
