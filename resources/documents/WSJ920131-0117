Two days after President Bush declared, &quot;By the grace ofGod, America won the Cold War,&quot; Lockheed Corp., McDermottInternational Inc.'s Babcock andamp; Wilcox unit and Olin Corp.said they've set up a jointly owned company, InternationalDisarmament Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The company's goal is to participate in planning andimplementing major disarmament initiatives either alreadyapproved or currently under discussion between the U.S. andthe former Soviet Union.   International Disarmament will be run by Troy Wade, aformer senior Energy Department official who once oversaw thenation's vast nuclear-weapons manufacturing complex. Mr. Wadewill report to a board composed of representatives of thethree parent corporations.   In an interview, Mr. Wade called the purging of theworld's nuclear arsenal &quot;an enormous problem&quot; that willprovide billions of dollars in potential business over manyyears. The company also wants a role in destroying chemicalweapons.   Some, however, were incredulous at the formation of thenew company. &quot;There's no market for them to take apart ourweapons because that's already well in the hands of theDepartment of Energy,&quot; said Thomas Cochran, senior scientistat the Natural Resources Defense Council. And in the formerSoviet Union, he predicted that &quot;they won't get to firstbase&quot; with military officials.   But Lockheed, Olin and McDermott clearly believe they canmake money, and they hope their swift action will give theman edge over potential competitors. They already have theireyes on a $400 million program approved by Congress last yearto help the former Soviet states get rid of their warheads.   &quot;I certainly don't believe we'll see people from the U.S.actually dismantling Soviet weapons or vice versa,&quot; Mr. Wadesaid. &quot;But I think there will be a lot of exchanges in termsof planning, engineering and design work.&quot;   For each of the three parent companies, the creation ofInternational Disarmament marks a stunning role reversal.Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., and the sixth-largestPentagon contractor, has for years built the Tridentballistic missile. Olin Corp., Stamford, Conn., has a centuryof experience as a munitions maker. And McDermott, based inNew Orleans, supplies nuclear fuel to the Navy.   The turnabout was not lost on Mr. Wade, who for 30 yearshelped the U.S. build its nuclear capability. &quot;After havingspent my entire career in this business,&quot; he said, &quot;Iappreciate how deadly these things are.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
