North asthe first of four defendants to be tried in the Iran-Contraconspiracy case.   Walsh advised U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of hisselection of North, but also asked the judge to reconsider hisdecision ordering separate trials for North, former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakimand Richard A. Secord.   Walsh asked that Gesell order two dual-jury trials in whichNorth and Poindexter would first be tried together and Hakim andSecord would then go to trial jointly.   Gesell had ruled that trying the four defendants jointly wouldprejudice their constitutional rights because of the inability touse the defendants' immunized congressional testimony as part ofthe defense.   Gesell had ordered separate trials to allow one defendant, forexample North, to use Poindexter's congressional testimony as partof his defense.   ``The government recognizes the need to safeguard such rights,but submits that there are ways to accommodate those interestswithout imposing the tremendous burden of four sequential trials onthe government and the judiciary,'' Walsh said in a brief filedwith the court.   Walsh said that two juries could be empaneled to hear a jointtrial of North and Poindexter without prejudicing each defendant'sconstitutional rights. ``The evidence the government would offer atseparate trials of North and Poindexter and of Secord and Hakimwould be overlapping,'' Walsh said.   Walsh said it would be logical to try North and Poindextertogether because they are accused of ``using their positions oftrust and power to facilitate and protect an illegal financial andlogistical network'' to divert U.S. arms sale profits to theContras.   Secord and Hakim should be tried together, Walsh said, becausethey are accused of operating an illegal enterprise ``to carry outactivities forbidden to the government.''   Walsh explained how a dual-jury trial could protect anindividual's constitutional rights. ``When one of the twodefendants being tried together seeks to introduce the immunizedtestimony of his co-defendant, the co-defendant's jury can beexcused from the courtroom, thereby protecting the defendant'sconstitutional right not to have his immunized testimony usedagainst him,'' he said.   Walsh had been given till Friday to notify Gesell whichdefendant he wanted to proceed with first. In asking the judge toreconsider his severance ruling, Walsh said that ``four separateand sequential trials will result in at least some of thedefendants living under the cloud of an indictment for severalmonths.''   ``The public has its own interest in a speedy resolution of thecharges against the defendants which may not be met if these casesare permitted to extend over a period of years,'' he said.   Legal experts say the Iran-Contra prosecutors were handed a``worst case scenario'' when Gesell ruled that the defendants musteach be tried separately.   ``It's like kissing a rattlesnake,'' said former federalprosecutor E. Lawrence Barcella Jr. of Washington, describing theordeal of conducting what is essentially the same case over andover again. ``It's not fun and usually injurious to your health.''   The immunized testimony would likely be inadmissible in a singletrial, thus denying defendants their normal right to cross-examineeach other on their prior statements.   The defendants have said the immunized testimony of the otherdefendants before the congressional Iran-Contra committees wouldshow their innocence. Prosecutors cannot introduce the immunizedtestimony of the specific defendant on trial as part of their caseagainst that defendant.   The four defendants are charged with conspiring to illegallydivert profits from U.S. arms sales to Iran to the NicaraguanContras when such assistance was banned.   Gesell said either North, a former National Security staffer, orPoindexter must be tried first. North is charged in 16 counts ofthe 23-count indictment, while Poindexter is named in seven.   The judge also said he had not made final decisions on whetherthe congressional immunity, given to all defendants except Secord,posed such a serious problem as to preclude trying the cases at all.   He said he would decide that and other major pre-trial issues byJuly 1 so he could set a date for a prompt trial.   One legal source familiar with the case who would comment onlyon condition of anonymity said the ruling could have one beneficialeffect for the prosecution.   He said Walsh would have the right to call anyone convicted inan earlier trial as a witness in a subsequent trial. If the fourhad been tried together, the prosecution could not call onedefendant to testify against another.   But Barcella, who handled major anti-terrorism cases as anassistant U.S. attorney in Washington _ and his former boss,ex-U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova _ agreed that on balance, theruling went against prosecutors.   ``This ruins the prosecution's entire strategy,'' diGenova said.``It's what every prosecutor dreads. It's the worst case scenariofor the independent counsel.   ``Prosecutors wanted all four in the courtroom together,'' hesaid. ``They wanted the entire conspiracy before the jury, whichcould look at them, see the evidence against all of them, and weighthe conspiracy against them.''   In his ruling, Gesell said: ``Any defendant should haveconsiderable leeway to use indirectly ... and possibly directlyimmunized testimony while defending the charges against him.   ``Each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimonyrevealed information which one or more of the defendants considershelpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect'' of thecase, Gesell said.   Separate trials are needed because trying the defendants jointlywould compromise each defendant's Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to challenge thetestimony through cross-examination, the judge said.   The judge provisionally denied a defense motion to continue thetrials until after the November election, saying prospective jurorswould have to be questioned about whether political discussionsabout the Iran-Contra affair would undermine their impartiality.   The judge also ruled all the trials would be held in Washington,denying defense requests that they be moved because of extensivepre-trial publicity.</TEXT></DOC>
