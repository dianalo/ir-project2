FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CARTERSVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The apparently random, brutal murders oftwo prominent residents were separated by 15 years, but they havecome together to shatter the serenity of this hill-country town.   Michael Berryhill, who has spent 14 years on death row and hascome within hours of the electric chair, faces a third trial in the1974 slaying of George Hooks Jr., manager of the local Union Carbideplant. Hooks was shot to death in his home as his family watched.   Berryhill's two previous murder convictions and death sentenceswere overturned on appeal. No trial date has been set.   Meanwhile, lawyers for 18-year-old William Scott are seeking achange of venue for their client, who is charged with the Feb. 11strangling of Addie Roper, the 75-year-old aunt of Gov. Joe FrankHarris.   The two cases have coincided because of a glacially slow appealsprocess for Berryhill and the rapid arrest of Scott. Together, thetwo crimes serve as reminders for Cartersville's 9,500 residentsthat small towns are less insular than they once were.   ``I guess Atlanta gets closer to us every day,'' said CharlesHurley, publisher of the Cartersville Daily Tribune News.   Cartersville is a nostalgic flashback, everybody's Our Town,tucked among hills, lakes and rivers 40 miles northwest of Atlanta.The town has had a few murders, but most were easier to explain,Police Maj. Charles Siniard said.   ``Domestic fights, or armed robberies,'' he recalled in a recentinterview. ``Nothing like these.''   Both Hooks and Roper appeared to have been chosen at random andneither knew their attackers, police say. Both times robbery was themotive and small change was the prize, they say.   On Oct. 7, 1974, a man forced his way into Hooks' home,terrorized his family and shot Hooks five times as his son, then 12,and wife watched. Hooks died the next day.   ``After he shot Hooks he put the gun in the boy's mouth andthreatened to blow that boy's brains all over the place,'' saidattorney William Elsey, who defended Berryhill in his first trial.   Berryhill, then 22, with 34 prior convictions and a habit ofgetting high from sniffing varnish, was convicted the followingJanuary and sentenced to die.   The conviction was thrown out by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals, which ruled that statements he made without a lawyerpresent were used in court. A second conviction and death sentencewere thrown out because the makeup of the jury was judged improper.   On Feb. 11, Mrs. Roper was killed in her home. The widow andretired florist was described by townspeople as ``everybody's aunt.''   Scott, who had a reputation as a troublemaker in nearby Cassvillewhere he lived, was arrested and charged within days of the killing.   Siniard said it was hard to explain how Mrs. Roper became avictim.   ``Why, let's say, didn't (the killer) stop at another housebefore he got to hers? There are some strange activities these days.We keep thinking, `Maybe it will never happen here again.' But italways will.''   Tim Chason, executive vice president of the local Chamber ofCommerce, raised a reward for the capture of Mrs. Roper's killer andsaid he had no problem getting pledges for $6,400.   The last time the town raised a reward, he said, was in the Hookscase.</TEXT></DOC>
