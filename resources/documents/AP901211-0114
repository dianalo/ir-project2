(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jenny Langley already has received theonly Christmas present she wants this year.   On Monday, Ms. Langley moved out of a hospital and into her ownhome.   Left paralyzed and dependent on a ventilator from two accidents,Ms. Langley, 27, has begun a one-year experiment to test whether aventilator-dependent quadriplegic can live outside an institutionsuccessfully and economically.   ``I'm so happy to be here. It's going to be a great Christmas,''said Ms. Langley.   With a $65,000 grant from the Shepherd Spinal Center in Atlanta,Ms. Langley wants to show state officials they could save money byproviding quadriplegics with independent care at home rather thanpaying to keep them in nursing homes or hospitals.   The Georgia Department of Medical Assistance for the first timenext year will seek funds to allow quadriplegics to live at homerather than in an institution. Six states - Oregon, Maine,Illinois, California, Minnesota and Rhode Island - offer fundingfor disabled people who choose to live at home, Shepherd officialssaid.   Deputy Commissioner Russell Toal said the medical assistancedepartment is asking for $584,000 for fiscal year 1992 to begin anindependent care program for 24 quadriplegics for six months.   ``It's something that's been needed for a long time,'' Toalsaid. ``I think we need to give them the opportunity to live ontheir own.''   A 1976 diving accident left Ms. Langley paralyzed from the waistdown at age 14. Ten years later, an auto accident paralyzed herfrom the neck down and made her dependent on a ventilator.   Ms. Langley's parents went broke trying to care for her. TheirYatesville home was sold on the auction block in July to satisfy anunpaid bank loan. Ms. Langley was admitted to Shepherd this summerwith respiratory problems, and she was planning to live in a$675-a-day South Carolina nursing home when she recovered.   ``We're really excited about this situation for Jenny. It's somuch better than the other placements we've had to do,'' saidShepherd resource director Leigh VanderEls.   Ms. Langley has a $125-a-day budget with which she'll pay forrent, utilities, food and part-time attendants. Sheryl Langley,Jenny's 33-year-old sister, and her two daughters will live withJenny in the three-bedroom, $750-a-month brick house about 30minutes south of Atlanta.   ``I don't know what I would do if I had to live in a nursinghome,'' Jenny Langley said. ``People who have their minds don'tdeserve to just be put away. They have a right to live.''   Quadriplegic Larry McAfee, a 34-year-old Atlanta resident whowaged a highly publicized court fight last year to win the right toshut off his life-sustaining respirator, said he is inspired by Ms.Langley's move.   ``Tell her I said good luck. It's fantastic,'' said McAfee, whoremains on a respirator and plans to move in January from anAtlanta hospital into an Augusta personal-care home with two orthree other quadriplegics.   McAfee has lived in several hospitals or nursing homes since a1985 motorcycle accident left him paralyzed from the neck down.   ``Anytime you can get away from an institutional setting, it'smore stimulating. It allows you the freedom to live,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
