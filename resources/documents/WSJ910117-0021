As a potential response to the U.S. attack on Baghdad, theIraqi president has the means to flood the northern Gulf withmillions of gallons of fuel from three Iraqi oil tankerssitting in Kuwaiti ports or from huge storage tanks near thecoast, American intelligence agencies and other analysts say.The fuel could be set ablaze to deter troops storming Kuwaitby sea and to cause a huge oil slick. His other oil weaponwould be to ignite Kuwait's onshore oil wells.</LP><TEXT>   A black tide of oil floating down the Gulf coast wouldstir economic havoc by threatening to shut down power plantsand desalination facilities that provide most of the drinkingwater for Saudi Arabia and other countries.   Igniting dozens or even hundreds of Kuwait's 1,080on-shore oil wells would fill the skies with smoke and soot.Military analysts acknowledge the heat and smoke would limitvisibility and could interfere with use of certain American&quot;smart,&quot; or precision-guided, weapons.   In addition, top U.S. scientists worry that if the oilwells burn for many months, a smoke cloud would float acrossthe globe that would lower the temperature and could affectthe climate to an unknown degree, similar although far milderthan the &quot;nuclear winter&quot; effect prophesied to follow anuclear war.   If Saddam Hussein employs his oil-weapon option, hissuccess will depend in part on whether wind and tidalcurrents favor the allied forces and carry the oil slick andsmoke safely away from the battleground and industrialfacilities along the Saudi coast.   In addition, oil-industry officials say it's difficult tosustain a fire on the sea unless there is a continuousreplenishment of fresh crude, and even then a strip ofburning crude could be maneuvered around if it is far enoughoff the coast.   Reports reaching some industry officials, however, claimthat Saddam Hussein has an alternative option to deter anamphibious landing: refined products such as jet fuel andnaptha stored in tanks with pipes leading directly into thesea so he could set fires right at the shoreline.   While use of some weapons could be a hindrance, militaryexperts said U.S. troops probably wouldn't be gravelyaffected.   William Kirk, a retired U.S. Air Force general, saidprevailing winds in the region would probably remove thicksmoke obscuring targets. &quot;I would think it would be anexercise in futility for Saddam Hussein&quot; to try such tactics.   Retired Maj. Gen. Gerald Carey, former commander of theU.S. Air Force Tactical Air Warfare Center, said the sort ofweapons that can't see through smoke include the Maverickair-to-ground guided missile that homes in on heat and theGBU-15 guided bomb unit that homes in through televisionpictures or infrared rays. Radar-guided systems wouldn't beaffected, he said.   Anthony Cordesman, a congressional staff director andmilitary expert, said such actions as creating oil slicks todeter landing craft &quot;can be effective tactically; it haltsoperations for a while. It can buy Saddam some time,&quot; hesaid. But he added that a U.S. attack wouldn't be limited toamphibious landings. None of these tactics &quot;is awar-stopper,&quot; he said.   Regardless, using an oil spill to force refineries,desalination plants and electric-generating facilities toclose -- even briefly -- in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatarcould be more effective than isolated terrorist acts againstIraq's enemies, said Edward Badolato, a Washington energy andcounterterrorism expert who served in the Reaganadministration. He said he has heard estimates that Iraqcould be prepared to unleash as much as 25 million barrels ofoil -- 100 times more than the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska.   &quot;In a worse-case scenario, it's possible Saddam Husseincould shut down the Gulf {economy},&quot; said Richard Golob,publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin. Oil would spoildesalination plants and oily water can't be used to coolpower plant turbines, he said. Other industrial facilities,such as refineries, also could be shut down if they couldn'tget good water.   In any event, the environment loses if a large amount ofoil is unleashed in the shallow, enclosed Persian Gulf andoil wells or storage tanks burn uncontrolled.   Mr. Golob said that if Mr. Hussein orchestrates a spill orseverely damages Saudi oil facilities, there is potential for&quot;a series of oil spills that would spill more oil than thelargest oil spill to date -- the Ixtoc I,&quot; a well blowout inthe Gulf of Mexico in 1979 that spilled 140 million gallonsof oil.   Friends of the Earth, a Washington-based environmentalgroup, reported that a 1983 oil spill after Iraq hit someIranian offshore oil platforms caused massive destruction ofmarine life in the Gulf and temporarily shut down the250,000-ton shrimp industry. Large desalination plants alsowere closed for a few days after oil booms couldn't block tarballs from entering the plants.   More uncertain are the atmospheric effects from Kuwaitioil wells burning out of control, potentially for months.Prominent U.S. scientists, including Carl Sagan of CornellUniversity, and Richard Turco and Brain Toon of NASA's AmesResearch Center, in interviews shared concerns expressed in apreliminary study by European and Jordanian scientists that agiant smoke cloud could ascend to the atmosphere and causetemperature changes. Some of the scientists believe it couldaffect the monsoon season in India and Southeast Asia andeventually could temporarily lower temperatures in NorthAmerica.   Mr. Sagan, one of the originators of the &quot;nuclear winter&quot;theory, said the effects could be akin to an 1815 volcanoeruption in Tambora, Indonesia, that was followed in 1816 bywhat's known as the &quot;year without a summer&quot; -- when NewEngland had frost throughout the spring and summer.   Mr. Toon, however, questioned whether the effects would beso far-flung or dramatic. He said that temperatures andvisibility would drop in nearby areas covered by the sootcloud, and that the smoke cloud probably would be noticeableup to 2,000 miles away. But he said affects on the climate&quot;are hard to predict.&quot;   ---   Robert S. Greenberger contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
