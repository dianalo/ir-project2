A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced into the United States. The regulations set forth proceduresfor obtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movementof a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Monsanto Agricultural Company, of St. Louis, Missouri, has submitted anapplication for a permit for release into the environment, to field testtomato plants genetically engineered to express a gene from <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis</T3> var. <T3>kurstaki</T3> HDl that encodes a protein called delta-endotoxin.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tomato plant under the conditions describedin the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Monsanto Agricultural Company, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene from <T3>B. thuringiensis</T3> var. <T3>kurstaki</T3> HDl encoding the delta-endotoxin protein has been insertedinto a tomato chromosone. The expression of this gene provides toleranceagainst the larvae of select lepidopteran insects. In nature, genetic materialcontained in a chromosone is generally transferred to another sexuallycompatible plant by cross-pollution. In this field trial, no introducedgene can spread to another plant by cross-pollination, because the fieldtest plot is located a sufficient distance from any sexually compatibleplant with which these experimental tomato plants could cross-pollinate.2. Neither the delta-endotoxin gene itself, nor its gene product conferson tomato any plant pest characteristic.3. The bacterium from which the delta-endotoxin gene was isolated is nota plant pest and is widely distributed in the environment as a soil inhabitant.4. The vector used to transfer the delta-endotoxin gene to tomato plantcells has been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and doesnot pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom the DNA of a tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid with known plant pathogenicpotential, has been disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for pathogenicityhave been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested and shownto be not pathogenic to any susceptible plant.5. The vector agent <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens,</T3> a phytopathogenic bacterium, was usedto deliver the vector DNA and the delta-endotoxin gene into tomato plantcells. The vector agent has been shown to be eliminated and no longer associatedwith any transformed tomato plant.6. Horizontal movement or gene transfer of the delta-endotoxin gene isnot possible. The vector acts by delivering and inserting the gene intoa tomato chromosome (i.e., chromosomal DNA). The vector does not survivein or on any transformed tomato plant. No mechanism for horizontal movementis known to exist in nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosomeof a transformed plant to any other organism.7. The toxic polypeptide produced by the engineered gene is called delta-endotoxin.Upon ingestion, the toxin kills only the larvae of select lepidopteraninsects. Delta-endotoxin is not toxic to other insects, wild or domesticbirds, fish, or mammals. Because of its safety, its topical applicationon crops is permitted up to the time of harvest.8. The size of the field test plot is small (0.2 acre and a total of 600transformed tomato plants) and will be located on a private research farmin a rural area. The field test plot will be located at least 30 feet frombreeder or commercial tomato plants and is surrounded by other agronomiccrops and orchards.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331<T3> et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 6th day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
