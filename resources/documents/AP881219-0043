Lech Walesa, chairman of the free trade union movement, convenedthe group Sunday. Previously, it had been an informal council thatWalesa had gathered five times since May 1987 to make broad policystatements on the behalf of the opposition.   The so-called Citizens Committee, comprising 128 intellectuals,Solidarity supporters, opposition activists, farmers and artists, isintended to bring together disparate elements in a united voice ofopposition.   The participants have in common a willingness to negotiate withthe government. Groups such as the Confederation for an IndependentPoland, which urge independence and the removal of the communistsystem, were not included.   Government-controlled radio and television reported the formationof the Citizens Committee, signaling at least tacit acceptance ofthe organization.   In its first statement, the group said Solidarity's reinstatementis ``of crucial importance. ... Without such a decision a sufficientand credible structure for reform will not be created.''   The committee will meet four times a year and establish 15commissions to examine specific social needs and suggest solutions,leaders said after a daylong conference in Warsaw. Incorporated intothe structure are commissions of opposition experts who have beenpreparing, at Walesa's request, to take part in talks with thegovernment.   Still, there are no new signs when those talks might take place,said Andrzej Wielowieyski, an adviser to Walesa who spoke for thecommittee.   Communist authorities promised negotiations with the oppositionas a condition for Walesa's help in ending a wave of strikes inAugust, but they have repeatedly delayed the talks.   Wielowieyski said members of the group see the talks as only onemeans for beginning dialogue with the government. He said thedialogue could take other forms, through the commissions.   The commissions were organized for various topics. Among them:political and economic reform, education, housing, nationalminorities, culture, youth and ecology.   Walesa has confirmed continuing low-level contacts between theopposition and authorities in recent weeks, but would say nothingabout the content of the discussions.   On the surface, relations between Walesa and the authorities havenever been so cordial since Solidarity was crushed in a 1981military crackdown and outlawed the following year.   In the past month, Walesa has been allowed to speak his mindwithout censorship in a national television debate, was permittedhis first foreign trip since Solidarity's heyday and has seen hispublic statements and activities broadcast and even praised in theofficial media nearly every day.   On Thursday, Walesa said recent remarks by government spokesmanJerzy Urban have come ``very close'' to Solidarity's demand for astatement of intent to reinstate the organizaton.   Solidarity has asked for such a declaration as a condition forstarting formal talks with authorities on tackling Poland's dauntingsocial and economic problems.</TEXT></DOC>
