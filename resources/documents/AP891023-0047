Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada said Mrs. Thatcherignored ``fair play'' by issuing a separate dissenting statementwithout telling the others just an hour after the summit releasedits South Africa declaration Sunday.   The dispute flared when the 49-nation summit of Britain and itsformer colonies resumed in closed session on its penultimate date.   Britain had signed the Commonwealth declaration, whichincorporated Mrs. Thatcher's objections to key provisions. Thoseincluded giving the white-led government six months to fulfillpromises of dismantling apartheid and calling for tighter financialpressure on Pretoria.   In her dissenting statement, Mrs. Thatcher endorsed thedeclaration's stipulation that current embargoes should bemaintained but charged that they have strengthened white extremismin South Africa.   Today with the leaders sitting round the conference table,Mulroney and Australia's Bob Hawke, the main authors of thedeclaration, criticized Mrs. Thatcher.   ``The price of Commonwealth membership is loyalty,'' Mulroney'saides quoted him as saying.   British officials reported Mrs. Thatcher replied she was``astounded and utterly appalled'' at the attacks.   Mulroney told reporters after the heated session, ``I believe ifyou are going to function in a Commonwealth you have to follow thebasic British tradition of fair play.''   ``Where would we be if 49 countries did this?'' he said. ``Yousign a deal at five o'clock and repudiate it at six ... (saying) bythe way, what I signed really doesn't reflect all my views.''   Prime Minister Hawke told Mrs. Thatcher, ``This is not the waybusiness should be done,'' Australian officials reported.   Hawke and Mulroney said they had wide backing from the otherleaders in the mainly Third World organization, which includesblack African countries that are deeply hostile to South Africa'swhite-led government and apartheid.   The contretemp was the latest over South Africa, which quit theCommonwealth in 1961.   For most of the 1980s the sanctions issue has split theorganization, which prides itself on being a unique ``family'' witha shared language and history.   Mrs. Thatcher is the Commonwealth's sole opponent of imposingtough embargoes. She has argued forcibly at Kuala Lumpur that SouthAfrica's new president, F.W. de Klerk, deserves encouragement inmoves toward reform, not more sanctions.   In Pretoria, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said,``Sanctions can only further delay the negotiation process in SouthAfrica.''   ``Any efforts to prescribe a time schedule or an agenda isrejected by the South African government,'' he added.   The declaration says the sanctions aim to bring the Pretoriagovernment to the negotiating table.   Mrs. Thatcher, leaving the conference hall, said she wasentitled to spell out her ``different view.''   ``You've got to be fair. You've got to be fair,'' she said.   New Zealand tried to smooth things over.   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer said Mrs. Thatcher's ``way ofdoing things ... isn't calculated to make the heads of governmenthappy.''   ``But I don't think it is good for the Commonwealth to turn itinto an organization that orchestrates hymns of hate against theUnited Kingdom,'' he said.   British Foreign Secretary John Major claimed late Sunday thatBritain has ``dragged'' the largely Third World organization intosoftening its position on South Africa.   Australia and Canada denied this, saying South Africa will facenew reprisals unless it has set about the ``irreversible''abolition of apartheid by April.   In the delaration, the Commonwealth said it would call forgreater financial pressure on South Africa. That includes askinginternational banks to restrict South African trade credits to amaximum of 90 days and make it more difficult for South Africa tosecure loans.   The body also decided to appoint a new body to scrutinize SouthAfrica's trade links.   Mrs. Thatcher objected to these provisions.   Britain has refused to implement most of a list of 11non-mandatory Commonwealth embargoes adopted in 1986. Blacksouthern African Commonwealth members also continue to tradebecause of their economic dependence on South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
