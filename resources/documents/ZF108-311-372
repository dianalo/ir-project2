(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Maturation Of DB2andM;IBM's Database-2 relational database management system, now in some 5,000sites worldwide, has become a significant force in the market for mainframeDBMSs in much the same way that Big Blue's Customer Information and ControlSystem (CICS) dominates the market for transactions monitors.andM;The second survey of DB2 users by the DB2 Midwest Users Group and the KnauerUser Group--the first was conducted in 1988 (see DATAMATION, &quot;DB2 Users StandUp To Be Counted,&quot; Oct. 15, 1988, p. 45)--reveals the maturation of the IBMDBMS.andP;  Two years ago, less than 40% of the sites polled used DB2 primarilyfor developing production applications.andP;  Today, that number has jumped to72%.andM;Relational databases have moved into mainstream IS, resulting in many morecommitted DB2 users.andP;  From 1985 through 1988, most shops used DB2 mainly forits report-writing and ad hoc query capabilities.andP;  Decision support systems,end-user data access, information center support and applicationsproto-typing were the norm.andP;  Users often extracted data from IMS databases orVSAM files and downloaded them into DB2 tables, periodically refreshing thedata from their &quot;production&quot; sources.andM;Developers now routinely build production DB2 applications.andP;  Many featurereal-time on-line updating.andP;  Transactional systems are common.andO;Mission-critical, bread-and-butter IS application are now built with DB2.andM;A Greater SophisticationandM;Within this evolution, DB2 environments have become more sophisticated.andP;  Mostinstallation support multiple DB2 subsystems for development, production,systems programming support and quality assurance/control.andP;  Larger sitestypically run over a half dozen DB2 subsystems, and even small shops maintainseveral.andM;Since DB2 concurrently connects to several transaction monitors, users haveto decide which monitor or monitors to employ.andP;  Results show that 70% ofsurvey respondents use CICS, compared with 60% in 1988; 57% mention TSO/ISPF,compared with about 85% in 1988; and only 17% use IMS/DC, compared with 41%in the previous survey.andP;  The increase in CICS use underscores DB2's role as abase for on-line transaction applications.andP;  We also found that users programheavily with TSO/ISPF, employing DB2 as a database system for interactiveapplications.andM;The survey found most installations use traditional programming methods withDB2, despite rising activity in the newer areas of computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) and application generators.andP;  Forty-two percent of thoseDB2 sites responding use COBOL II, 63% run COBOL and 9% employ PL/1.andP;  A fewsites use other programming languages with DB2.andP;  Compared with the previoussurvey, these figures show that COBOL II has finally achieved popularity inthe IS community.andP;  The numbers also confirm the permanent relegation of PL/1to a small but loyal following, which its inclusion in IBM's SystemsApplication Architecture (SAA) is unlikely to change.andM;Third-Party Tools ProliferatingandM;The market for add-on DB2 tools is growing fast.andP;  The respondents unanimouslyagree that DB2 alone is insufficient--the product requires additionalsoftware for appropriate use.andP;  Over 75 vendors offer nearly 200 tools forDB2.andM;As DB2 users move more applications to production, they are finding thatmanual techniques and administrative enforcement of migration procedures areno longer adequate.andP;  Migration tools have therefore become important.andP;  Onedata migration tool, IBM's Data Extract Facility, is currently used by 37% ofthose sites surveyed, up 4% from the previous survey.andP;  For object migration,IBM's Data Base Migration Aid Utility is used by 23% of all sites responding,compared with 18% in the previous survey.andP;  BMC Software Inc.'s DB2/ALTERcaptures 16% of the respondents' business, compared with under 2% previously.andM;Security is another area of concern and a traditional DB2 weakness.andP;  Users inthe survey view DB2 security as unwieldy, unnecessarily complex and laborintensive.andP;  On average, installations have five system administrators;however, many sites have more, and one site even reports 50.andP;  This suggeststhat some sites have experienced real security exposure with their DB2 data.andO;While several products are mentioned, the most popular security product isReston, Va.-based Systems Center Inc.'s DB/SECURE, capturing a 15% share ofresponses, compared with 6% in the previous survey.andM;THE MARKET FORandM;ADD-ON DB2 TOOLSandM;IS HUGE ANDandM;GROWING FAST.andM;Almost all DB2 users by program testing and development aids.andP;  On-lineSoftware's ProEdit is the single most popular product for program development(as it was in the previous survey), mentioned by 16% of respondents, comparedwith about 10% in the last survey.andP;  Compuware Corp.'s Abend-Aid for DB2 leadsthe debugging market and is mentioned by 24% of survey respondents.andP;  In thelast survey, less than 2% of respondents said they were using the FarmingtonHills, Mich.-based company's product.andM;Respondents consider performance monitors essential to controlling their DB2environments.andP;  The current leaders are DB2 Performance Monitor from IBM, witha 42% respondent share (compared with 32% in the previous survey); LosAngeles-based Candle Corp.'s Omegamon, with 23%; and Insight/DB2 from GoalSystems International Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, with 4%.andP;  Both the Candle andGoal products received less than 2% of the responses previously.andM;Little CASE PenetrationandM;Despite all the hype over CASE tools, users at more than 50% of the DB2 sitessurveyed say they are not yet using them.andP;  Those who do use Index TechnologyCorp.'s Excelerator (21%), Knowledge-Ware Inc.'s Information EngineeringWorkbench (8%), CGI Systems Inc.'s PACBASE (7%) and Texas Instruments Inc.'sInformation Engineering Facility (4%).andP;  All four products registered lessthan 2% of the responses previously.andM;The survey results highlight the current low level of integration for CASEtools.andP;  A key criticism of DB2 has always been its lack of a data dictionary,raising the question of why no vendor captured much of this market niche.andO;The reasons are that users have been waiting for IBM's Repository Manager,which was finally announced on September 19, 1989, and the fact that manyCASE tools feature built-in dictionaries.andP;  In the current survey, New YorkCity-based BrownStone Solutions Inc.'s DataDictionary/Solution maintains its4% respondent share, while Manager Software Products Inc.'s DATAMANAGER alsoretains its 4% share.andM;Concerning their use of application generators, 17% of respondent mentionIBM's Cross System Product (CSP), up 6%, while the same percentage citesPansophic Systems Inc.'s TELON, which chalked up 12% previously.andP;  Otherproducts fell far behind these two.andP;  The significant increase in CSP use useis especially evident in more sophisticated applications.andP;  Combined withIBM's announcement of native COBOL GENERATION AND A CSP workstation option,these survey results lead us to believe that, within a year, CSP will eitherhave become the dominant application generator or will have demonstrated thatit can never do so.andM;More than 50% of this year's survey respondents report that they use noapplication generator.andP;  This is based on conservatism caused by lack ofstandardization in this marketplace, as well as the fact that CASE tools andfourth-generation languages are being used to do some of the thingsapplication generators can do.andM;Sites employ a variety of tools to enable end users to access DB2 data.andO;IBM's Query Management Facility is used by 80% of all DB2 sites queried, uponly 2%, whereas New York City-based Information Builders Inc.'s FOCUScaptures 24% of respondents, compared with 18% previously.andP;  Both Norwalk,Conn.-based Must Software International's NOMAD and Micro Decisionware Inc.'sPC/SQL-link are used by 7% of all sites.andP;  Last time, NOMAD was mentioned by3% of respondents, PC/SQL-Link by 2%.andP;  AICorp Inc.'s English-retrievalconcept in Intellect is embraced by 4%, up from about 2% previously.andM;Most striking is the fact that over 50% of the respondents say that IS shopsstill require users to submit information requests through the IS departmentor information center.andP;  Many shops try to protect DB2's productionperformance by limiting ad hoc requests.andP;  However, the survey also elicitedexamples of shops that successfully employ DB2 for concurrent transactionaland query systems.andP;  Our conclusion is that DB2 supports concurrenttransactional and query applications, but that this requires knowledge ofspecialized techniques.andM;Split Responsibilities for DesignandM;The survey queried respondents not only about the products they use and theapplications they use them for but also about the way their IS organizationsmanage DB2 operations.andP;  In line with this, a number of questions were askedabout who does which jobs relating to database design and management.andM;Who performs logical and physical design in DB2 shops?andP;  The findings aresurprising: 10% of the installations surveyed don't do logical design.andP;  Insome instances, this means that end users create tables that mirror flatfiles.andP;  In a few cases, DB2 shops just ignore logical database design issuesaltogether.andM;Concerning physical database design, 10% of respondents assign this task totheir application programmers.andP;  These sites are probably building applicationdatabases.andP;  Some companies report that they simply employ DB2 as asophisticated access method, the same phenomenon that was reported for yearsin IMS shops.andM;To what degree are applications programmers involved in low-level designissues?andP;  The survey explored this issue by tracking the kinds of SQL DataDefinition Language statements programmers issue.andP;  Results can be seen in thechart entitled &quot;The Controlled Environment of DB2.&quot;andP;  On the one hand, thelarge number that issue CREATE TABLESPACE statements is an indication thatmany programmers directly control physical storage.andP;  On the other hand, the45% share of respondents who cannot create their own tables or indexessuggests that many shops maintain very controlled environments.andP;  DB2 shopsrun the gamut, from those that are totally open for application programmersto those that restrict DB2 much as they did IMS and CICS/DL-1.andM;The Performance QuestionandM;IS users have a right to be suspicious of relational performanceclaims--after all, vendors and partisan theoreticians have advocatedrelational systems for years, regardless of the reality experienced on adaily basis at the average IS shop.andP;  However, the survey data indicate thatDB2 version 2 finally turns the performance corner.andP;  Statistics show thatreal users under typical conditions no longer view relational performance asunobtainable, but rather as a goal that can be reached by overcoming a seriesof technical challenges.andP;  The results at sophisticated DB2 shops prove thatperformance can be achieved through development of appropriate relationalexpertise.andM;Part of the problem in talking about performance is the lack of a precisedefinition for this term.andP;  The steps shops follow to optimize performance maydiffer, depending on whether they define it in terms of transactions persecond, wall-clock response time, number of query rows retrieved per CPUsecond, number of concurrent on-line users or using other measurements.andM;For example, DB2 users routinely implement large tables.andP;  Tables with betweenone and 50 million rows are commonplace.andP;  A few users even find DB2's 64gigabyte per table limit restrictive, particularly in applications involvinghistorical or archival data.andP;  Many shops report subsecond response time forqueries that retrieve specific rows from very large tables.andM;Reported transaction volumes are still relatively low for DB2 applications.andO;Ten transactions per second is on the high end, although there are a fewnotable exceptions.andP;  However, due to companies' perception of competitiveadvantage with such systems, high-volume applications are under-reported inthe sample.andP;  Also, while many designs are in progress for high-volumeapplciations, there is an inevitable time-lag involved in the development ofthese applications.andP;  A key factor in these measurements is that sites withversion 2 report anywhere from 10 to 33% improvement over version 1.3, withthe largest gains achieved when MVS/ESA is paired with version 2.andM;New DB2 CapabilitiesandM;In our previous survey, referential integrity (RI), which provides validationof references across tables or between rows within a table, surfaced as acritical user requirement for DB2.andP;  IBM met this need in version 2, and usersare now grappling with questions concerning its effective use.andP;  Thirty-sixpercent of survey respondents either currently employ RI or plan to shortly;58% are undecided.andP;  The undecideds remain cautious due to the inability toknow what will happen when they start using RI.andP;  We predict that these userswill embrace RI once they better understand its impact on applications.andM;Users also face issues concerning how to best use the distributed databasecapability offered in DB2 version 2, release 2.andP;  Today, DB2 V2R2 supportsremote units of work only between DB2 subsystems.andM;The survey indicates that users view vertical connections (data distributionbetween machines of different sizes) as their top priority.andP;  More to thepoint, DB2 users want to connect DB2 to IBM's desktop product, the OS/2Extended Edition Database Manager.andP;  The demand for horizontal distribution isexactly what IBM has already provided, a DB2-to-DB2 connection.andP;  Interest indistribution DB2 data to SQL/DS and SQL/400 databases appears quite low.andM;In consering what IBM provides with DB2 V2R2, 8% of the respondents plan touse its distributed DBMS capability.andP;  Two percent state that they will notuse it; 90% are uncertain.andP;  These results show that IBM is ahead of the usercommunity with its distributed database capability.andM;Our feeling is that distributed DBMS will parallel the path taken by DB2,which was announced in 1983, became available in 1985 and only became adominant production platform in 1989.andP;  Distributed DBMS will follow a similarpattern of announcement, availability and integration into IS over a periodof several years.andP;  Industry analysts who predict that distributed DBMS willbecome predominate in a year or two are incorrect because the user communitydoes not yet have the experience to handle this new technology.andM;What are the main requirements users have for DB2?andP;  For structured querylanguage, the respondents want outer joins and unions in view definitions.andO;Important requirements for tables include expansion of the column limit, theability to change column definitions easily, row locking, domain integrity,fast-path direct processing and expansion of the 64GB table size limitation.andO;Other needs include parallel utility processing of table partitions and datatypes for multimedia storage (image, voice and video).andP;  Finally, many usersmention their desire to run QMF under CICS, apparently unaware that toolssuch as the Platinum technology inc.'s Platinum Report Facility provide thefunctional equivalent.andM;DB2 has reached a critical turning point in its short history.andP;  It is finallythe primary production database system for its many users, supportingmission-critical production processing and ad hoc information requests.andP;  Withthis evolution, however, new concerns have surfaced.andP;  Attention is now beingfocused on how the new DB2 environment can be managed.andP;  Increasingcapabilities have led to increased complexity, with concerns aboutperformance monitoring and tuning, migration, mixed transaction/queryapplications and security and administration pressing MIS management.andM;Linda Garcia-Rose is the coordinator of the Knauer DB2 Users Group, andHoward Fosdick is president of the Midwest DB2 Users Group.andP;  Both are vicepresidents of the International DB2 Users Group.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
