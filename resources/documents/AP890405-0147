Many residents believed the U.N. forces would be activated April1 and monitor a peaceful transition to independence for themineral-rich territory South Africa has ruled for 74 years.   But at least 200 people have been killed since fighting eruptedSaturday, according to South African officials who say mostcasualties belonged to the guerrilla South-West Africa People'sOrganization. The guerrillas say about 50 of those killed werecivilians.   ``We are disappointed in the situation, but we don't know who toblame,'' said Gabriel Nekongo, 38, who teaches near Oshakati.   South Africa says SWAPO sent 1,400 guerrillas into the territoryfrom bases in southern Angola in a deliberate attempt to sabotagethe peace process. A U.N. investigation found SWAPO fighterslaunched a ``major incursion'' into northern Namibia, according toBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   SWAPO, which gets most of its military support from East blocnations, says the heavily armed guerrillas had been in theterritory some time and acted only in self-defense after SouthAfrican-led security forces attacked them.   Residents are not sure what to believe. Most have littleeducation and rely largely on word of mouth. Newspapers are notreadily available and the territory's television and radio stationsare controlled by the South African government, which mostNamibians regard with suspicion.   SWAPO draws most support from northern Namibians who compriseabout half the nation's 1.3 million people. Residents say theystill are loyal to the movement and doubt the organizationintentionally would disrupt the independence process.   One rumor circulating is that the South Africans dressed upprisoners and forced them to stage mock battles. Others saysecurity forces have crossed into Angola in pursuit of SWAPOguerrillas.   Residents also say they have been disillusioned by the inabilityof the U.N. peacekeeping troops to control events. Although 4,650soldiers have been authorized for the Namibia operation, less than300 are in the northern war zone of this countr larger than thestate of New Mexico.   ``They will have to prove their credibility before we can trustthem again,'' said Fobie Jacobs, who works at the Human RightsCenter in Oshakati. ``The U.N. should send more troops to thenorth. They should never have implemented (independence) without atleast half of UNTAG here,'' he said of the U.N. TransitionAssistance Group.   The few U.N. troops present are often seen in the company of thesecurity forces, further undermining their credibility in the mindsof many Namibians.   A U.N. soldier stands watch at the gate to Oshakati's whitetownship, which includes military and police bases and aresidential area reserved for whites.   A few U.N. peacekeepers have been seen driving around Oshakati,but they maintain a low profile.   ``They come to the bottle (liquor) store, then leave,'' said oneblack businessman. ``I guess they cannot talk to us. I guess theyhave to be impartial.''</TEXT></DOC>
