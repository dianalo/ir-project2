The would-be father will not seek a contempt citation againstthe woman, but ``is concerned about the people who advised her.They acted lawlessly,'' attorney James Bopp Jr. said Thursday.   The woman's attorneys said she made the decision to have theabortion.   Bopp said he might try to find out who performed the abortionand who advised the woman to have an abortion. Those people couldbe targeted for further legal action, he said.   Meanwhile, the appeal of the injunction in the case was assignedThursday to the Indiana Court of Appeals while the woman shunnedpublicity.   ``She would just like to disappear,'' said Terre Haute attorneySamuel E. Beecher Jr., who represents the unmarried womanidentified in court documents as V.J.H.   ``She's a very private person. She never imagined that she wouldhave had this publicity,'' said Beecher.   The woman's attorneys said they cannot reveal when or where theabortion was performed, but they said no one coerced the woman tohave an abortion.   ``A whole lot went into her decision-making process, and thoseare considerations of the utmost personal nature that don't have tobe brought out in court or the media and she didn't,'' said RichardA. Waples of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union.   The woman's attorneys announced on Wednesday that she hadundergone an abortion despite the permanent injunction grantedMonday in response to the request of a 24-year-old Terre Hautedelivery-truck driver who claimed to be the father of the unbornchild.   Attorneys for both sides asked for an expedited appeal to thestate Supreme Court. On Thursday, the justices rejected thatrequest, noting that the case no longer is an emergency, and toldthe Court of Appeals to consider the issue.   The case hasn't yet been assigned to a three-judge panel in theCourt of Appeals, according to that court's administrative office.   Because the case involves a paternity action, the names of theman and the woman are not revealed in court documents. The woman'sattorneys dispute the man's claim to be the father.   Attorneys for both sides argued that, despite the abortion, thecase isn't moot.   Waples said the injunction issued by Vigo Circuit Judge RobertH. Brown ``represents a fundamental assault on a women's right toprivacy.''   ``If this order is allowed to go uncorrected, other judges mightbe tempted to do the same,'' he said.   Bopp said he wants a higher court ruling on whether a father'srights should be weighed against the mother's in cases where anabortion is in dispute.   ``Unless we get this case on appeal and the Supreme Courtupholds the father's right, we could have other cases of a fathergoing to court and getting an injunction but the woman going aheadand getting an abortion,'' said Bopp, who also represents thenational Right to Life organization based in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
