Dole: television coverage. The withdrawal announcement, on a day when many other campaign events were canceled because of a snowstorm, dominated the network and local TV stations' coverage of the critical New Hampshire primary only four days before the vote.    All three networks, leading their evening broadcasts, showed Mr. Haig insisting Sen. Dole is &quot;head and shoulders&quot; above Vice President George Bush. And CBS devoted an unusually long six minutes to the report, including an interview in which anchorman Dan Rather gave Mr. Haig a chance to lambaste Mr. Bush again.    The bonanza of airtime devoted to a questionably significant political event illustrates TV's crucial importance at this stage. Especially in the eight days between the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, substance typically becomes a blur in voters' minds while video images dominate. For most of last year and early this year, newspaper political coverage set the agenda, with TV following the lead of print. But in this abbreviated time capsule, TV coverage totally dominates the dialogue and its influence is enormous.    &quot;No question. There's an Iowa bounce, and you can see it in everybody's coverage going into New Hampshire,&quot; says Mr. Rather. Adds Eddie Mahe Jr., a Republican campaign consultant, &quot;Campaigns are totally at the mercy of the networks, because they unilaterally decide how much coverage to give a candidate and what is the tone of that coverage.&quot;    Monitoring the networks, particularly their evening news shows, over the past seven days, produces these conclusions:   --George Bush dominated network news last week, receiving nearly 2 1/2 times more coverage than the week before. But much of that coverage was negative, reflecting his third-place finish in Iowa. Network anchors and correspondents described Mr. Bush as &quot;desperate,&quot; &quot;with his back against the wall,&quot; or &quot;fighting for his political life.&quot; Conversely, Sen. Dole was pictured as triumphant and on a roll. The networks didn't increase their coverage of the Senate minority leader, but did increase the positive spin on his campaign. One network reporter said Sen. Dole &quot;has turned into Mr. Nice Guy.&quot;    --Former TV evangelist Pat Robertson scored big in gaining media attention after his surprising defeat of Mr. Bush in Iowa, but basically positive reports on his new rise were occasionally sprinkled with negative images from his earlier preaching days.    --Curiously, for Rep. Richard Gephardt, who won the Democratic caucuses in Iowa, a significant portion of coverage was negative; all three network anchors asked him about &quot;flip-flops&quot; in his voting record. By contrast, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who finished third among Democrats, got a lot more coverage, which was mostly positive on his excellent chances in the state next door.    --And perhaps the biggest impact of the TV coverage was on those candidates the networks ignored, such as Democrat Bruce Babbitt and Republican Pete du Pont. Any prospects for a decent New Hampshire showing were wiped out when they were all but excluded from the TV news. (The airtime allocations were based on data from DWJ Associates, a New York-based firm that maintains a computer database of network news.)    The power of the press to give the so-called Iowa Bounce -- or the boot -- to presidential candidates brings criticism. &quot;The media's universal treatment of Iowa as the definitive elimination contest, rather than as a tentative finding, sets up New Hampshire as a do-or-die drama for the candidates,&quot; complains William Adams, a George Washington University professor whose study of the 1984 campaign found recipients of the Iowa Bounce enjoyed a significant boost in nationwide polls.    But news executives counter that the primary schedule, not the media, gives television and the Iowa results their enormous power at this point in the presidential race. &quot;There's just too short a time between Iowa and New Hampshire for any decisive piece of information to be given to the public other than how a particular candidate showed in Iowa,&quot; says NBC commentator John Chancellor.    TV's huge influence in interpreting the Iowa results has also been called a bump, or as Mr. Bush says, &quot;the Big Mo.&quot; It was recognized as a political phenomenon in 1984 when Gary Hart unexpectedly came in second in Iowa, was showered with TV coverage, and triumphed a week later in New Hampshire.    This time around, the networks seemed to pick and choose which candidates they thought have done better than expected. They played up Mr. Robertson's showing; ABC's Peter Jennings, for example, called the former evangelist's second-place finish the &quot;enormous story.&quot;    TV coverage is a very subjective business. Jesse Jackson won double-digit support in mostly white Iowa, but has been essentially shut out of network coverage, while Sen. Albert Gore, who finished a dismal seventh, has not. Last night, ABC aired a feature on Mr. Jackson, after his campaign complained that the network had canceled an interview with him after the caucuses.    TV political coverage can have an immediate impact on a campaign in terms of fund-raising and organizational support. The Dole campaign's polling showed a six-point surge for the senator after Mr. Haig's announcement. &quot;He gave us an incredible bump,&quot; says Thomas Rath, a top Dole operative in New Hampshire. &quot;We dominated the news that night.&quot;    The candidates who don't benefit from the Iowa Bounce may find themselves bounced out. According to Greg Schneiders, an adviser to Mr. Babbitt: &quot;If you don't bounce, it's a splat.&quot;    ---           Network Coverage Before and After Iowa   By number of minutes on evening network news Monday through Friday                              Week              Week                              Before            After                              Caucuses          Caucuses    George Bush               10:00             24:30    Robert Dole                8:50              9:15    Pat Robertson              5:20             14:10    Jack Kemp                   :20              2:20    Pete du Pont                :15               :25    Michael Dukakis            2:15              8:10    Richard Gephardt           6:10              4:55    Paul Simon                 2:45              5:55    Gary Hart                  2:50               :45    Albert Gore Jr.            ----              3:15    Bruce Babbitt               :35               :55    Jesse Jackson               :15               :40   Source: DWJ Associates Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
