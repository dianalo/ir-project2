The administration wants the money but doesn't want to call itsplan a tax.   But that's just what it sounds like to the largest manufacturerof chlorofluorocarbons, Du Pont.   ``They'll be sued. We will challenge it for sure,'' said acompany official, Tony Vogelsberg.   The target for the revenue raising is windfall profits thatchemical firms could earn after an international treaty reducessupplies of chlorofluorocarbons, which destroy the ozone layer andincrease risk of skin cancer.   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the influential HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee, says the administration has ``nospecific authority to levy a tax on ... these commodities,'' andcautioned against bypassing his committee or ignoring Congress'taxing authority.   Dingell, however, indicated he hasn't formed a final opinion.``I don't have any dogs in the fight at this particular time,'' hesaid.   To complicate matters, the Environmental Protection Agency andthe Office of Management and Budget are at odds over how to collectthe money. OMB wants to auction off rights to produce a specificamount of CFCs. EPA favors a more straightforward fee on companyprofits.   OMB has budgeted $400 million in revenues in fiscal 1990, $1.5billion in 1991 and $550 million in 1992. The first-year revenuefigures survived an overall budget agreement between congressionalnegotiators and the administration.   Both agencies agree, however _ and the industry hotly denies _that there will be windfall profits for manufacturers later thisyear, after the U.S. begins implementing a 1987 internationalagreement to cut production of the so-called CFCs.   The government's theory is that demand will far outstrip supplysome months after July, when production must be frozen at 1986levels. The Montreal Protocol requires that by 1998, production canbe only 50 percent of 1986 figures.   The five manufacturers of CFCs are developing substitutes, butthey are three to five years away from production. EPA spokesmanChris Rice said the companies may not hurry to produce them ifthey're making windfall profits on current CFCs.   ``The companies will be making 20 percent less (starting thisyear), and the price could go up 500 to 600 percent,'' Rice said.``They can bring in an incredible amount of money. We're afraid ...they will have the incentive, because of the profit, to stall, todelay ... introduction of the substitutes.''   Vogelsberg, Du Pont's environmental manager for the freonproduction division, said, ``We don't see windfall profits asreally being there.   ``If I say I have a monopoly position and I'm going to raise theprice, you're going to remember what I did to you. I want tomaintain a long-term business relationship. We will not charge morethan our cost justifies.''   But Vogelsberg, whose company makes half the U.S. supply ofCFCs, said producers will need more money to pay $2 billion to $3billion for new plants to make substitutes. Companies have largeresearch and development costs, he added.   CFCs, manufactured by five companies, are used in refrigerators,large air conditioning units and car air conditioners, high energyfoam insulation for modern construction, solvents for cleaningcomputer components, and cushions in seats and sofas.   Three companies also make ozone-depleting chemicals calledhalons (including one firm that makes both chemicals), which areused in fire-fighting equipment. Halon production will be frozen in1992 at 1986 levels.   Bob Thoma, vice president of government relations for BASF, afoam insulation maker, said a tax on manufacturers would find itsway to consumers with disastrous consequences.   ``If you put a $2 per pound tax on roofing applications, itwould add $15,000 for the cost of a roof,'' he said. ``You coulduse other materials that are less expensive, but do not have thesame insulation benefits.   ``The consequences (of switching products) are higher energyconsumption, including burning of coal and oil _ which causesgreater degradation in the greenhouse effect (global warming) andacid rain.''   Smaller manufacturers of the insulation would go out of businessand jobs would be lost, Thoma said.   ``We will get that $400 million somehow, one way or another,''vowed OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay, referring to the first-yearprojected revenues. ``You have to base the argument for windfallprofits on no cheap substitutes being available as supply decreasesand demand remains constant.''   Emissions from CFCs and halons are non-toxic when released intothe atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15-20miles to the stratosphere, their chemical bonds break apart.   Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing moreof the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach Earth, causing more skincancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.</TEXT></DOC>
