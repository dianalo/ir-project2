Morris case.andM;Even if an agency gets interested in a virus case, it might not have enoughlegal ammunition to make prosecution worth the expense.andP;  Almost everyjurisdiction has enacted some type of computer-crime statute, but most ofthese laws don't specifically address viruses and worms.andM;Existing laws, like the Federal Communications Privacy Act and the ComputerFraud and Abuse Act, sometimes provide vehicles for prosecution.andP;  But smartdefense attorneys often get around such laws on technicalities.andP;  Worse, itdoesn't look like Congress will pass strict anti-virus legislation any timesoon: Bills aimed at viruses have been stuck in committees for the last fewyears.andM;Congressional staffers attribute this to a shortage of unified user support.andO;Occasionally the computer press calls for stiffer prosecution of &quot;virusniks,&quot;but in general the user community remains divided, with apathy the leadingposition.andM;More stringent U.S.andP;  legislation may not have much global impact: Viruses andworms can easily cross international borders, and varying national interestscan make dealing with an international virus complicated.andP;  The Pakistanigovernment, for instance, was not unduly worried about the border-hopping&quot;Brain&quot; virus; the hue and cry in Washington fell on deaf ears in Islamabad.andM;But all is not lost!andP;  Next time, I'll have tips for dealing with viruses.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
