Not to mention to kick Democratic presidential candidate MichaelDukakis around from one end of the Superdome to the other.   After 7{ years of laboring in Reagan's larger-than-life shadow,Bush will be conqueror of all he sees at the 34th RepublicanNational Convention.   His name will be the only one entered into nomination forpresident Wednesday night, while his rivals from the long agoprimary campaign nurse dreams of joining the ticket as running mateor else take their place in line with the dozens of conventionspeakers.   Bush and his high command intend to milk all the suspense theycan out of the selection of a running mate, in large part tomaximize television ratings for the convention. ``There won't beany leaks of this one because I'm not gonna tell a soul,'' Bushboasted last week.   The list of contenders runs to a dozen or more names that seemedto shift slightly depending on the day. Illinois Gov. JamesThompson announced Friday that he did not want to be considered,but former presidential primary rivals Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. JackKemp as well as others have been campaigning for the post forweeks. Long shots who say they're interested include Sens. DanQuayle of Indiana and Pete Domenici of New Mexico.   There is no doubt that Bush's choice of a running mate will winapproval from the delegates, although Sen. Gordon Humphrey of NewHampshire has been threatening a conservative protest if Bushdoesn't pick someone sufficiently to his liking.   Bush will depend on surrogates to rough up Dukakis, who holdsthe lead in virtually all public opinion polls. He has tapped Dole,former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Sen. PhilGramm of Texas _ sarcastic tormentors of the Democrats _ amongothers to rough up his opponent.   New Orleans, known for its jazz, its Mardi Gras and itsrestaurants, has been planning for the Republican invasion formonths.   Even Bourbon Street _ where jazz halls compete for customerswith the seedy burlesque houses _ has prettied itself up to apoint. ``There are lots of weirdos here, but everyone should seethem. It's hot but excellent,'' said Jeff Levy, a delegate from LosAngeles in town a few days ahead of the rest of the pack.   Democrats have decided to stay away from New Orleans, unlikeRepublicans who held daily news conferences at the DemocraticNational Convention last month to take potshots at the proceedings.Dukakis will tend to statehouse duties in Massachusetts on Mondayand Tuesday but campaign in the Midwest and elsewhere during thefinal two days of the GOP convention.   Republicans have spared no expense in mapping out a conventiondesigned to maximize Bush's chances of victory in the fall.   The podium where the vice president will deliver his acceptancespeech next Thursday night was built at a cost of more than$500,000. Its red, white and blue color scheme was designed withtelevision in mind _ as was almost everything else.   The vice president's high command has choreographed a delicatedance to dramatize the passing of the Republican torch from Reaganto Bush.   Thus, they have turned the first night of the convention over toReagan, the man who twice led the party to landslide victories.With Bush watching at home in Washington, the delegates will see avideotaped tribute to the president. Then Reagan will address thedelegates and the prime time viewing audience.   He is expected to describe in glowing terms the accomplishmentsof his two terms _ and contrast them with the 21 percent interestrates, runaway inflation and ``malaise'' that he and Bush inheritedfrom the Democrats in 1981.   Tuesday morning Bush will arrive in New Orleans and meet Reaganbriefly before the president's departure for California. From thenon, it will be Bush center stage.   Republicans will approve their platform Tuesday, a conservativeblueprint that rules out higher taxes, says no to abortion, andaffirms Bush's intention of deploying ``Star Wars.''   With Bush advisers providing cues from just off-stage,Republicans spent their pre-convention week drafting a 30,000-worddocument designed to contrast with the bare-bones Democraticplatform. GOP chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the platform would notbe all that different from the one Reagan ran on in 1980 and 1984,although planks dealing with AIDs, health care and education wereinserted at Bush's direction.   ``We're a conservative political party,'' Fahrenkopf said.``We're proud of that. We're not afraid of the `c' word.''   Tuesday's convention program includes Kirkpatrick's speech, aswell as an address by former President Gerald R. Ford and thekeynote address by New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean.   Wednesday night will mark Bush's formal victory in a roll callof the states that will end in a unanimous endorsement of hiscandidacy. Television evangelist Pat Robertson, the only othercandidate to arrive in New Orleans with pledged delegates, will nothave his name entered in nomination, and will speak to theconvention Tuesday night.   Bush will have his name entered into nomination by Gramm, withseconding speeches to be delivered by a football coach, a Hispanicwoman, a congressman from California and Bush's son Jeb and hiswife, among others.   The official convention schedule does not call for Bush to visitthe hall Wednesday night, although his aides say they areconsidering a late night appearance at which he would dramaticallydisclose his running mate to the waiting world.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug 14</NOTE></DOC>
