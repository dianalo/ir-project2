Brown IIIStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMR LABORAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> FORT WORTH, Texas  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines flight attendants, reversing a no-strike stance after more than a year of contract talks with the carrier, could walk out as early as Christmas.    Separately, the union said it won't complete its proposed merger with the nation's largest flight attendants union, the Washington, D.C.-based Association of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO.    The board of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents American's 12,000 flight attendants, will ask its members to vote next month to authorize a strike, with the Christmas holidays as a target date for a possible walkout, said Patt A. Gibbs, the union's president.    An American spokesman said he wasn't aware of the union vote and declined to comment.    Ms. Gibbs said the board is confident it will win the backing of its members. She said a union straw poll showed a &quot;very solid majority&quot; of union members in favor of granting union leadership the authority to call a strike.    Ms. Gibbs said the union's board is supporting a strike because it doesn't believe the company has negotiated in good faith since it unilaterally imposed a new contract June 1 on the flight attendants. In addition, Ms. Gibbs said, the union believes the company is in a &quot;more weakened position&quot; since the stock-market crash. The union also was encouraged by a recent court ruling which requires Trans World Airlines to reinstate flight attendants whom it replaced during a strike last year. TWA has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.    The union said it has backed off from some of its earlier demands in negotiations with the company since June 1, but said American hasn't yielded. &quot;We couldn't continue to chisel away until all we had left was the imposed contract,&quot; Ms. Gibbs said. She said the union withdrew its latest contract offer last week after talks broke down.    The contract that American, a unit of AMR Corp., imposed in June boosted the average pay for a first-year flight attendant to $14,900 from $13,500, and the average salary of an attendant at the top of the wage scale to $37,700 from $37,100, American says. The union, however, says the increases are illusory because the contract also imposed work-rule changes that allow American to staff some flights with fewer attendants and reduce minimum rest periods and minimum pay guarantees in some instances.    Ms. Gibbs said the strike authorization ballot would be counted around Dec. 20.    A Christmas strike could create serious service problems for American, which has mounted a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign stressing its service record. Although the airline can hire replacement flight attendants, it probably would have difficulty training enough of them to handle the busy holiday traffic.    If American attendants refuse to authorize the strike, it would be a severe blow to Ms. Gibbs's leadership. A dissident faction of the union already is seeking to oust her. As previously reported, American's flight attendants defeated the union's proposed merger with the Association of Flight Attendants, which Ms. Gibbs strongly favored, by a vote of about 55% to 45% last September.    The union refused to validate the vote pending an investigation of alleged company interference in the balloting process. Ms. Gibbs said the law firm the union hired to investigate the balloting found &quot;substantial interference&quot; by American. As a result, the union said it won't certify the count, but said it decided to let the vote stand as &quot;an interfered-with election&quot; instead of seeking a new vote. It said it will pursue mergers with other unions instead.    American has denied interfering with the merger vote, calling the allegations &quot;preposterous and without foundation.&quot; It said it went to &quot;extraordinary lengths&quot; to remain neutral and stay out of the balloting process. </TEXT></DOC>
