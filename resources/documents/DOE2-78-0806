As President Reagan and CanadianPrime Minister Mulroney signed the Free Trade Agreement on January 2nd1988. This agreement, however, cannot be implemented until approved bythe Congress and the Canadian Parliament. A number of hearings on theagreement have been held by both the House and Senate, including oneconducted by the Subcommittee on Mining and Natural Resoruces which theauthor chairs. This hearing focused solely on the energy and mineralimplications of the proposed agreement and was marked, in his opinion,by an almost roguish attitude by the Administration witnesses towardour domestic mining sectors. With the anticipated increase in Canadianpower exports to this country -- fostered to an even greater degree bythe Free Trade Agreement's proposed elimination of Canadian NationalEnergy Board restrictions on this trade currently in place -- coupledwith the expected decline in U.S. steam coal exports to Canada, theymay reach a point in the not too distant future when there is a net marketloss for U.S. coal. This translates into less employment in the coalfieldsof this nation. And that is something they can ill afford.</TEXT></DOC>
