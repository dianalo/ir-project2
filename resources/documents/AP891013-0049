Ambassador Donald Gregg and his wife escaped through a side doorminutes after six invaders with homemade bombs, tear gas grenadesand steel pipes stormed the residence and began smashing artworks,lamps and pottery.   Police used tear gas to overpower the students, described byofficials as an ``anti-U.S. death squad.'' They shouted ``Drive outthe Yankees!'' while being dragged away.   They protested U.S. pressure on South Korea to lower tradebarriers and demanded that President Roh Tae-woo cancel a visit toWashington scheduled for next week.   About 2,000 radical students protested or fought police laterFriday on at least 11 campuses in Seoul, Inchon and Kwangju. Policereported two dozen arrests.   Hundreds of protesters at Konkuk, Sogang and KyungheeUniversities in Seoul hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police,who responded with tear gas. The students burned American flgagsand effigies of Roh and President Bush.   Gregg and his wife, Meg, were sleeping when the students stormedthe house. The ambassador said he did not see the students butcould hear them on the other side of the locked bedroom door.   ``I never saw any of them,'' Gregg told a news conference. ``Weheard shouting in Korean. ... I don't know what they wereshouting.''   He said the living room, where the damage was done, is 50 to 60feet from the bedroom.   Gregg said the attack would not affect U.S.-Korean relations.``This is the act of six people who broke into our home and I don'tput a larger signifiance on it than that,'' he said.   South Korea's governing Democratic Justice Party called therampage a ``senseless riot'' and leading opposition partiesdenounced it.   U.S. Embassy officials said there had been a security problem atthe residence, but would not elaborate. They said they securityprocedures would be reviewed.   Security for the residences is handled by a private firm undercontract and U.S. Marines are not posted there, the officials said.   In Washington, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who heads the Housesubcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said: ``Incidents ofthis type represent misguided actions of only a small minority. ... I continue to believe that a strong U.S.-South Korean partnershipis in the interest of both nations.''   Gregg, the fomer CIA station chief in Seoul, became ambassadorlast month and radical students have been protesting since. Theyclaim he was sent to South Korea to impose military rule.   Police officials, who would not let their names be used, saidthe students used homemade bombs to distract police, then scaledthe wall of the residence compound and hurled tear gas grenades atsecurity guards who tried to stop them.   Once inside, the raiders blocked the main door with chairs andsprayed the floor with paint thinner, threatening to ignite it ifpolice attacked, and threw more of the homemade bombs at police,the officials said.   U.S. diplomats described the devices as ``firecracker-like noisebombs,'' used in other attacks on U.S. diplomatic and militaryfacilities, which make a loud bang but cause little damage.   At least one student was draped in the South Korean flag and allshouted ``Punish Gregg!'' and ``We oppose U.S. trade pressure!''   Authorities said one student was slightly injured in a scuffleand police were seeking four others who helped the invaders enterthe compound.   The Party for Peace and Democracy, the main politicalopposition, said it regretted the assault, but said the UnitedStates should note that excessive trade pressure feedsanti-American feeling in South Korea.   Radical students are a small but influential minority on collegecampuses, but have little public support because of their violenttactics and extreme views.</TEXT></DOC>
