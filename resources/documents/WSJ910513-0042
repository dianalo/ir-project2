According to the banks' planning officials, new lendinggrowth will shrink drastically to 2% or 3% for long-termcredit banks and 4% to 6% for city banks in the first halffrom double-digit growth the year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   The banks are working under the assumption that they won'tbe allowed to do any equity financing at least for the restof the fiscal half that began April 1.   Japan's 11 city banks are national commercial banks thattake consumer deposits and make retail and short-termcommercial loans. The country's three long-term credit banks,originally set up to finance major industrial andinfrastructure projects, specialize in long-term corporateloans and can issue debentures to fund themselves.   With the cost of obtaining subordinated loans now becomingtoo expensive to continue aggressively, the banks say theyhave little choice but to restrict new lending to try andmeet the Bank for International Settlements capital-adequacystandards.   &quot;We will try many ways&quot; to meet the BIS rules, whichrequire banks to have capital equal to 8% of risk-weightedassets by March 1993, &quot;but the most efficient, mostinfluential way is equity finance,&quot; an official at one of thelong-term credit banks said. Bankers say they believe thegovernment is frowning on that method of raising capital,even though the Ministry of Finance denies it has given suchguidance.   &quot;Assuming that we don't have equity financing or thesubordinated loans, the only choice is our retainedearnings,&quot; said Ryuzaburo Harasawa, a planning official atMitsubishi Bank. But &quot;the retained earnings wouldn't supportadditional assets, so it's only natural to slow new lending.&quot;   To meet the BIS standards, at least half of the banks'required capital must be &quot;Tier 1,&quot; largely retained earningsand equity. The balance can be made up of &quot;Tier 2&quot; capitalsuch as securities and subordinated loans.   The official at the long-term credit bank said his bank isholding new lending growth to about 2% for the half. &quot;If wecould, we'd like it to be zero&quot; to speed the accumulation ofneeded capital, he said.   The impact on customers is expected to be &quot;severe,&quot; headded, as corporate demand for funds for capital investmentremains high. As a result, he said, the banks are negotiatingnew lending structures with clients, raising the rates forexisting as well as new loans.   &quot;They're trying to improve the lending structure, to solvethe mismatching problem&quot; that stems from tighter lendingplans, said Toshiko Seo, a financial analyst at SchroderSecurities. &quot;If the banks' stance is clear, they'll have astronger position in loan negotiations.&quot;   But while stricter lending could be favorable for thebanks on the retained earnings side, holding capital in theform of securities carries risks if their value declines.   &quot;We're well-positioned, well over 8%&quot; for the BISstandard, a spokesman at one of the 12 city banks said,adding this caveat: &quot;under the condition that the Nikkei 225won't be volatile or in a slump.&quot; But some fear the cutbackin new lending may actually fuel a decrease in securitiesprices.   With growth in fixed investment spending expected tooutpace growth in bank lending -- the government forecasts a7.9% climb in such spending in fiscal 1991 -- corporationssuch as high-debt, large-capital steelmakers and tradinghouses will be forced to borrow elsewhere, or to raise fundsthrough the equity market.   The implications are manifold: one is the impact of addedsupply on an already diluted stock market. Another is thepotential for nonbank lenders to liquidate stocks and bondsto raise funds for the loans they will make to offset slowerbank lending.   The banks point to the Ministry of Finance's &quot;unspokenlaw&quot; against equity financing as the key reason they've hadto limit lending, although officials at the ministry'ssecurities bureau and its banking bureau deny any suchinstruction, written or otherwise.   &quot;There are many companies that would like to try equityfinancing if there is a chance,&quot; one bank's planning officialsaid. But he said the Ministry of Finance, by discouragingbanks, wants to avoid giving the impression that it currentlysupports that method of raising capital.   Analysts speculated that among the government's reasonsare that it has an enormous amount of shares of its own toissue, such as the launch of its Japan Railways stock. &quot;Ifanyone's going to be able to sell new shares, the governmentthinks it'll be the first,&quot; one said.</TEXT></DOC>
