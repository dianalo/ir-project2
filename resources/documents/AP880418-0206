ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Monday that the atmosphere inthe New York primary campaign has been ``so divisive and soviolent'' that he has received more death threats than at any othertime in the 1988 presidential campaign.   In response to questions about the attacks on him by MayorEdward Koch, Jackson said, ``The name-calling and the accusationsand the attempts of a provocation by the mayor have not been goodfor the city or the campaign.''   Koch has kept up a drumbeat of attacks on Jackson.   Early in the campaign, the mayor said that Jews and othersupporters of Israel would ``have to be crazy'' to vote for Jackson.   In a television interview on Sunday, the mayor said Jackson haslied when he had claimed to be the last person Martin Luther KingJr. spoke to before he died after being shot in Memphis and againwhen he denied he had ever used the terms ``Hymie'' and``Hymietown.'' The terms are considered offensive to Jews andJackson later apologized for using them.   ``We have received more death threats in this campaign than inall the other combined because the climate has been so divisive andso violent,'' Jackson told a news conference.   Jackson customarily receives far more death threats than any ofthe other candidates, and travels with heavy Secret Service andother protection.   Later, he exhorted his supporters to turn out in force for theNew York primary and give him an upset victory that could scramblethe odds in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.   Standing in the rain at a get-out-the-vote rally in East Harlem,Jackson said, ``If you will stand in the rain today, you will votein the rain tomorrow. ... We've come too close. Nothing can stop usnow.''   Recent polls said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was gettingthe most support among likely Democratic voters with Jacksonrunning a strong second. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee was adistant third.   Turnout was the big unknown in efforts to predict the outcome onTuesday and Jackson spent the last full day of campaigning tryingto keep enthusiasm high among his strongest supporters.   He scheduled three rallies in different parts of Harlem whereblack and Hispanic voters turned out in large numbers to supporthim in the 1984 New York presidential primary, and a fourth inChinatown.   ``The race is getting closer and turnout is the key,'' said NewYork pollster Lee Miringoff. He said a low turnout would favorJackson, whose supporters are seen as generally being more ferventthan those of the other candidates, and thus more likely to followthrough and vote.   In a speech to the non-partisan Association for a Better NewYork, Jackson never mentioned Koch by name but referred to ``thosewho are inclined because of their fears to be bent towardhysteria.''   He went on, ``Leaders must set a high moral tone. I will notsurrender that tone to diversions.''   However, Gerald Austin, Jackson's campaign manager, had lessrestraint, saying, ``Koch is a lunatic. He's a lunatic by New Yorkstandards.''   The mayor, campaigning with Gore, dismissed the criticism fromthe Jackson camp.   ``So should I decline to say these things simply because he saysit's divisive?'' said the mayor. ``I mean he's not an icon. He's acandidate. Candidates have to be able to take it and respond.''</TEXT></DOC>
