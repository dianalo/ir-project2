Landmark oil-spill and AIDS-treatment bills were sent tothe White House with broad support from both parties. But thetone was set more by the forceful role of Speaker ThomasFoley in partisan debates over civil rights and campaignfinance. Commanding strong discipline in the South, theDemocratic leadership crushed a Republican, pro-businessamendment on employment discrimination standards. And in onerowdy, late-night fight, Mr. Foley overrode objections in hisown party to win adoption of legislation seeking to limitelection spending.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, intelligence legislation approved by theSenate would curb U.S. covert funding for wars in Cambodiaand Afghanistan. And the administration suffered a majorsetback on what became an almost party-line, 54-44 vote inthe Senate over the direction of the Strategic DefenseInitiative.   The Democrats' show of force served to divert attentionfrom the failure of Congress to act on the budget. But whenlawmakers return in September, they will be faced with theimmediate threat of massive across-the-board spending cuts. Atwo-month debt extension, approved before adjournment, willcontinue government borrowing until the new fiscal yearbegins in October. But the greater test will be meeting anambitious schedule agreed to by the leadership and the WhiteHouse calling for the completion of budget negotiations bySept. 10 and swift enactment of a deficit-reduction package.   Following is a summary of major legislative action beforeadjournment Saturday:                                                                                                          Debt and Budget                                                                                                          Congress sent to the White House legislation raising thefederal borrowing limit by about $73 billion, to $3.195trillion from $3.122 trillion. The increase is judgedsufficient to keep the government operating through Oct. 2,and the bill won quick approval after threats from lawmakersto attach amendments failed to materialize.   Left pending in the Senate is a long-term debt resolutionthat would extend the borrowing limit through fiscal 1991 andraise the debt ceiling to $3.44 trillion. Efforts to bring upthe measure late Saturday failed when conservatives objectedbecause the leadership wouldn't permit them to offer theirproposal for a capital-gains tax cut as an amendment. Thedebt-ceiling bill could yet serve as a vehicle to carry anydeficit-reduction agreement that emerges this fall but, forthe moment, both parties find it easier to agree on newspending.   Minutes before adjourning, the Senate rushed through amore than $28 billion transportation bill for the new fiscalyear, after tacking on a $10.9 million provision sought byGOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas for a highway project inWichita. The bill represents a $1.31 billion increase abovethe administration's budget and proposes federal rules to barinterstate truckers and bus drivers from using radardetectors.                                                                                                          Campaign Finance                                                                                                          Adopted 255-155, the bill proposes a $550,000 spendinglimit for most House elections and a matching tax credit ofup to $50 for in-state individual contributions. The measurestops far short of a Senate-passed ban on political actioncommittees and, to prevail, the leadership was forced to killa more far-reaching package calling for public financing anddeeper cuts from both PAC contributions and those of wealthyindividuals.                                                                                                          Civil Rights                                                                                                          By a 272-154 margin, the House approved legislation toreverse Supreme Court decisions last year regarding theapplication of laws prohibiting employment discrimination.The measure closely resembles a comparable Senate-passed billbut faces strong opposition in the administration, whichargues that the standards of proof and level of damagespermitted in the measure would impose an unfair burden onbusiness and encourage quotas.   In response, proponents agreed to a $150,000 cap onpunitive damages for employers with fewer than 100 workers,and language was added to say that nothing in the bill shouldbe interpreted as requiring hiring or promotion quotas. TheRepublican alternative, backed by the Chamber of Commerce,failed 238-188. The Democratic victory reflected strongpressure in party ranks by the Black Caucus and Majority WhipWilliam Gray. Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), a hero of the 1960scivil rights movement, delivered an emotional appeal in ameeting of the party's whip organization. The Democraticdelegations from his native Alabama as well as the Carolinaslater voted en bloc with the party. Georgia's delegation, bycomparison, was conspicuous in its opposition to theleadership and, in Arkansas, Rep. Beryl Anthony, chairman ofthe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep.Bill Alexander, who received help from black lawmakers in hiscampaign this year, sided with the GOP.                                                                                                          Environment                                                                                                          Ending a 16-year stalemate, the oil-spill legislationrequires all new tankers operating in U.S. waters to beequipped with double hulls. Federal liability limits areincreased and, despite administration objections, the measureleaves states free to set unlimited liability for shippersand other parties responsible for spills. Final approval cameon a 360-0 roll call but only after the House voted 281-82 toblock an industry effort to strip an attached provisionimposing a moratorium -- opposed by Mobil Corp. -- ondrilling off North Carolina's coast.   Separately, a House-Senate conference on clean-airlegislation reached agreement on provisions designed to phaseout production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicalsused in refrigeration and insulation but harmful to thestratospheric ozone layer. The standards would generallydemand that production be phased out faster over the nextdecade than now required under international agreementssigned by the U.S. Production of CFCs and carbontetrachloride would end by 2000, and methyl chloroform by2002. For HCFCs, which are less damaging substitutes forCFCs, output would be banned in 2030.                                                                                                          Health andamp; Safety                                                                                                          AIDS-treatment legislation sent to the president wouldinitially authorize an estimated $880 million annually forhealth care and early-intervention services by states andemergency-relief grants to areas hardest hit by the epidemic.Fifteen metropolitan areas, including New York, Boston,Dallas and San Francisco, are expected to qualify in fiscal1991 for the emergency aid, which is authorized at $275million but still subject to actual appropriations.   Separately, the Senate approved legislation that wouldrequire the use of child safety seats for infants andtoddlers on domestic commercial airline flights.                                                                                                          Trade                                                                                                          Congress approved an amalgam of trade provisions,including a restructuring of the customs user fee charged onmost imports. Trade benefits under the Caribbean BasinInitiative would be made permanent, and the bill also wouldmake permanent the current ban on the export of unmilled logsfrom federal land in the lower 48 states.   ---   Rose Gutfeld contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
