Neither of those had yet emerged -- the word capitalism was yet to be coined -- and they could not emerge until certain conditions, institutions, values and circumstances had come into existence. . . . The first was a set of attitudes toward property: that it be freely transferable from one owner to another, that there be no discrimination against commercial property in favor of land, and that active development be socially preferred to passive enjoyment. In addition, capitalism required at least four other conditions: a general commitment to the proposition that economic growth is both possible and desirable, governmental sanction of private endeavor as the principal instrument of growth, recognition of the market as the prime determinant of economic value, and legal and institutional means of turning credit into money and capital.    These conditions were only beginning to exist in the 1780s, when the Constitution was adopted: The period was one of transition from ancient, zero-sum conceptions of economic activity to modern, growth-oriented conceptions. Pre-capitalistic and anti-capitalistic values, attitudes and institutions, rooted in the feudal past, were far from dead in America, and those of mercantilism (a system in which economic activity was regulated by the state as a means of aggrandizing the state) were in full bloom. The new values, looking to free trade, entrepreneurship and a market economy, were little more than a gleam in the eyes of a few advanced thinkers.    The significance of the establishment of the Constitution, in the evolution of systems of political economy, was that it made possible -- though it was neither designed to, nor did it, make inevitable -- the transformation from the old order to the new. </TEXT></DOC>
