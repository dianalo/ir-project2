<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0476 </DOCNO><TEXT>The project of reserving 90 days' oil for emergency by private oil enterprisesin Japan started from FY 1975 and the addition of the 30 days' oil reservewas decided in 1978. The project has been smoothly carried out towardsthe target of 30 million kl in the end of FY 1988 and it is anticipatedthat the level of such reserve in the end of FY 1987 will be 27 millionkl. As the methods for reserving oil for emergency are such three formsas storage in tankers, utilization of oil tanks in the civil sector andstorage in the governmental oil reserve bases for emergency, but becauseof shifting the reserved oil in tankers to the reserve storage on land,the amount to be stored in tankers has become nil since FY 1985. Consequently,in terms of the estimation in the end of FY 1987, the oil reserve inoil tanks of the civil sector is 16.23 million kl and that in the governmentaloil reserve bases is 10.77 million kl. Concerning the construction ofthe governmental oil reserve bases for emergency at present, there arethe on-land reserving system (Mutsu-Ogawara, Tomakomai East, Fukui andShibushi), the on-the-ocean reserving system (Shiroshima and Kamigoto),the semi-underground reserving system (Akita) and the underground reservingsystem (Kuji, Kikuma and Kushikino). in addition, the Petroleum Councildecided in November, 1987 that the level of the governmental oil reservewas to be 50 million kl, equivalent to 90 days consumption by the middleof 1990.
