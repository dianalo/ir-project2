The dependenceof the optical gain on electron-beam quality, studied with the three-dimensionalFEL simulation code FELEX, is given and related to the expected powerof self-amplified spontaneous emission. We discuss issues for the dampingring designed to achieve the required electron beam quality. The ideaof a multipass regenerative amplifier is also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
