(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The USS Tennessee, the firstnuclear-powered submarine to fire the powerful new Trident 2missiles, was commissioned into the nation's fleet Saturday.   The nation's ninth Trident submarine was hailed as a weapon``fitted for the demands of modern peace,'' by former U.S. Sen.Howard Baker, who along with other Tennessee and Navy dignitarieswere in a crowd of about 1,200 who braved bitter cold to celebratethe submarine's formal entry into the fleet.   Nearly 100 anti-nuclear weapons protesters gathered outside thegates of the Naval Underwater Systems Center where the commissioningwas held. No protesters were arrested, police said.   Members of the Coalition to Stop the Trident had threatened alarge demonstration and acts of civil disobedience. Authoritiesresponded by assigning more than 80 police officers to theceremonies, according to New London Police Sgt. Kenneth Edwards.   The Tennessee is the first nuclear-powered submarine designed tofire potent Trident 2 missiles. The missiles have a range of 6,000miles, and each multiple warhead can strike up to 10 targets.   The missile continues to undergo tests, the latest of which wassuccessfully completed Friday at Cape Canaveral, Fla.   The Tenessee also is the first vessel to be assigned to theNavy's newest Trident submarine base at Kings Bay, Ga. The otherTrident base is in Washington state.   Baker, a former Republican senator from Tenessee and morerecently White House chief of staff, was the keynote speaker. U.S.Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter alsoattended the ceremonies.   ``Ours is a hard and bitter peace of which President Kennedyspoke, a peace guaranteed only by our strength, unquestioned andunsurpassed,'' Baker said.   ``The mission of the Tennessee we commission today is to keepthat peace,'' he said.   Tridents are the Navy's largest and most powerful weapon. Theyare 560 feet long and displace 18,700 tons when submerged. Each has24 missiles and a crew of more than na 150.   The Tennessee, the sixth U.S. or Confederate vessel to bear thestate's name, was built at the Electric Boat shipyard, a subsidiaryof General Dynamics Corp.   At the Trident submarine base in Bangor, Wash., on Saturday,about 120 people held a vigil to protest the commissioning acontinent away of the Tennessee, and its capability of firingTrident 2 missiles.   The eight Trident submarines at Bangor, about 15 miles west ofSeattle, will be converted to hold Trident 2 missiles within thenext few years, said Renee Krisko of Ground Zero Center forNonviolent Action, the group that organized the vigil. She said avigil also was held at the base in Kings Bay, Ga., where the USSTennessee will be assigned.</TEXT></DOC>
