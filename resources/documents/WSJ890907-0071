The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 24.89 to 2719.79, its steepest decline since Aug. 21. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled a moderate 161,800,000 shares, which still made it the busiest session since last Wednesday. Declining shares on the Big Board swamped gainers, 1,091 to 433.    Broader averages posted comparable losses. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.32 to 349.24, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index slid 2.98 to 327.90, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 1.66 to 194.18.    Traders said bearish comments by Morgan Stanley's chief investment strategist, Barton M. Biggs, published in the New York Times triggered selling by investors who had been nervous about the record heights to which the market climbed in its summer rally. Mr. Biggs advised clients to sell 10% of their stock holdings.    Stock groups cited by Mr. Biggs as overvalued -- airlines, hotels, food and soft drinks, and media -- were sold heavily.    &quot;A lot of the rumor stocks were hit, and there was general profit-taking in stocks like Woolworth that have had nice run-ups,&quot; said Christopher Pedersen, senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities. &quot;We had clients bailing out and protecting themselves from further market deterioration.&quot; Woolworth fell 1 5/8 to 67 1/8.    Large sell programs tied to stock-index arbitrage augmented the decline and drove the industrial average to about a 40-point loss at one point. In this strategy, traders capture profits by exploiting price discrepancies between futures and the underlying stocks.    Traders also said some investors believe the economic factors that fed the summer rally -- declining interest rates and moderate economic growth -- are disappearing, with interest rates now widely expected to hold firm for some time and the economy showing signs of possibly inflationary growth. The Dow Jones Transportation Average nearly matched the point decline in the industrials and was off substantially more sharply in percentage terms, falling 23.30 to 1508.71. Airline stocks involved in takeover speculation were among the biggest losers.    &quot;The group has had an excellent move, and it is not unreasonable to think that people would take profits,&quot; said Helane Becker, airline analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.    UAL, the parent of United Airlines and target of a $300-a-share buy-out offer, dropped 3 7/8 to 286 7/8. AMR, owner of American Airlines, tumbled 3 1/4 to 87, and Delta Air Lines retreated 1 7/8 to 79 1/2. USAir Group fell 1/2 to 50, and Alaska Air Group slipped 1 to 28.    Midway Airlines rose 1 5/8 to 20 5/8. Ampco-Pittsburgh, which has said it may seek control of the company, raised its stake to 9.6%    In the media group, McGraw-Hill eased 1 1/8 to 77 1/4, MCA dropped 2 to 62 1/2, Gannett skidded 1 3/8 to 46 3/8, and Capital Cities/ABC fell 10 to 507. Among beverage issues, Anheuser-Busch declined 7/8 to 41 1/8, Coca-Cola dropped 7/8 to 64 3/4, and PepsiCo lost 5/8 to 57.    Traders said a little bargain-hunting helped pick up the market when the industrial average was at its low point, but concern about the potential for further setbacks kept many would-be buyers away.    &quot;It's got people sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see which way they want to jump,&quot; said Dan Williams, a vice president of trading at Dillon, Read andamp; Co. &quot;They're going to let the market tell them which way to go here.&quot;    Prices gradually recovered late in the day as a round of program selling subsided, but traders said the market's loss of upward momentum is likely to remain an obstacle to any recovery attempts. &quot;There's nothing saying to jump back into stocks,&quot; Mr. Williams said.    Among the lodging stocks, Holiday rose 2 to 83, and Hilton fell 3/4 to 108.    In the blue-chip area, Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing dropped 2 to 76. One of 3M's top officials forecast that third-quarter earnings would be slightly higher than a year earlier and said a slowdown in the U.S. economy is continuing to affect several of its businesses.    Other weak blue-chips included International Paper, down 2 3/8 to 55 3/8; Boeing, down 1 to 55 1/2; Procter andamp; Gamble, down 1 3/4 to 126, and Merck, down 1 to 72 1/4.    Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber surged 4 1/8 to 57 5/8 amid rumors that Pirelli of Italy would offer to acquire the company for $90 a share. Goodyear said it hasn't heard of a bid coming from Pirelli or anyone else, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Texaco was on the Big Board's most active list, falling 1/4 to 50 5/8 on 6.3 million shares, more than five times its average daily volume. Mr. Pedersen of Twenty-First Securities said Tuesday was the last day investors needed to hold the stock to capture a special $3-a-share dividend.    Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe andamp; Jack fell more sharply than any other Big Board issue in percentage terms, dropping 2 1/8 to 13 1/2, a decline of more than 13%, in response to a disappointing second-quarter earnings report. More than 1.2 million shares, about 12 times the stock's average daily volume, changed hands in composite trading.    Litton Industries rose 2 to 96 3/4 amid continuing speculation that Teledyne Teledyne might sell its 28.7% stake, either to the company or to a third party that may call for a restructuring or sale of Litton. The company declined to comment.    Phelps Dodge climbed 2 1/4 to 77 1/4. The company declared a special dividend of $10 a share and said it plans to repurchase as many as two million common shares, or about 5.7% of the total outstanding.    Wells Fargo advanced 2 1/8 to 85, a 52-week high. PaineWebber placed the stock on an &quot;action list&quot; of recommended banking issues and removed Norwest, which fell 3/8 to 22 1/8.    Georgia Gulf went up 1 1/8 to 59 5/8 in response to the plans of Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons and NL Industries, which he controls, to try to unseat the company's board. Mr. Simmons and NL own a combined 9.9% stake and have offered to acquire the company or help it recapitalize. NL fell 5/8 to 27 1/4.    The American Stock Exchange Index lost 1.66 to 382.87. Volume was 12,300,000 shares, compared with 12,460,000 Tuesday. There were 211 issues advancing, 367 declining and 259 unchanged.    Thermedics gained 7/8 to 16 5/8. The company, which produces a drug-detection device, attributed the gains to optimism about the sales outlook for the product in light of President Bush's newly announced program to combat illegal drug use. </TEXT></DOC>
