Their numbers overwhelmed authorities trying to provide for them.;   In Britain, Prime Minister John Major said today that plans were beingcompleted to send British and French troops, U.S. engineers and U.S. aircover. Major proposed such an enclave last week, but it received an initiallycool reception from Washington.;    &quot;I can well appreciate that many Kurdshave good reason to fear for their safety if they return to Iraq,&quot; Bush saidat a hurriedly called news conference. &quot;And let me reassure them that adequatesecurity will be provided.&quot;;    &quot;We are not going to say to them, 'Come downfrom the mountains, you will be protected,' and then not protect them,&quot; Bushsaid.;    The president's action amounts to an open-ended safety guarantee forhundreds of thousands of Kurds who rose up in rebellion against Saddam andthen fled in terror when their insurrection collapsed. Relief workers say thatup to 1,000 refugees are dying each day of exposure, dehydration and dysenteryalong the Turkish border.;    Bush's order came amid criticism in Congressthat U.S. aid for the refugees was too little, too late, and that thepresident had abandoned the very people he had encouraged to rise up againstSaddam.;    Bush said he was confident that Saddam would not take any militarystrikes against the refugee havens.;    &quot;The collective judgment of the peoplethat figured the war out pretty well is that he won't risk this,&quot; thepresident said. &quot;And Saddam Hussein is not going to want to re-engage in thatnature.&quot;;    White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush originatedthe idea of sanctuaries within Iraq and then won approval from France,Britain, Germany, Turkey and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.;   Officials did not immediately say precisely where the camps would be locatedinside Iraq -- other than at lower, more hospitable elevations.;    Nor didthey say how many troops would be sent and to what extent the plan would helpKurds who fled to Iran. Western relief efforts have focused on those IraqiKurds massed on the Turkish border.;    Turkey says there are 600,000 Kurds onits border, 400,000 of them inside its territory. About 1 million are massedat the Iranian border.;    Iraqi Foreign Minister Ahmed Hussein Khuddayeral-Sammaraei said today that stationing foreign troops on Iraqi soil wouldinterfere in Iraq's internal affairs. But he did not mention any possiblemilitary response by the Iraqi army, which was routed by the allies in thesix-week Persian Gulf war.;    In London, Major told a news conference thatallied officials were meeting at the U.S.-European command headquarters inStuttgart, Germany, for &quot;detailed planning&quot; of the northern Iraq operation.;   &quot;There will be British troops there, there will be French troops there, therewill be American engineers there, there will be American air cover. But theprecise size of that will be determined over the next few hours,&quot; he said.;   Bush said the number of U.S. forces would be &quot;rather small.&quot; However,Fitzwater said, &quot;I would think it would take thousands of people.&quot;;    TheWhite House said Tuesday that U.S. forces had already been moving in and outof northern Iraq as part of the relief effort for the Kurds but that theywould not intervene in the civil war.;    More than 8,000 U.S. militarypersonnel were being deployed to Turkey to set up an aid infrastructure forthe refugees before turning it over to international organizations.;   Kurdish rebel leader Jalal Talabani today called the enclave plan &quot;good newsand another step forward.;    &quot;Our people welcome the development. They feelthey are not alone now and that some countries are ready to protect them,&quot; headded, speaking at his headquarters in rebel-held Iraqi territory near thetown of Suleimaniyah.;    But some refugees in crude settlements at themountainous Turkish border said they would not return to Iraq as long asSaddam remains in power.;    &quot;You cannot believe Saddam. If not now, afterfive years, 10 years, he will come back and ask us 'why did you do that (theKurdish rebellion)?' &quot; said Salem Botani, 30, in Isikveren, Turkey. &quot;Bushcannot stay there one year, three years or five years.&quot;;    In otherdevelopments:;    (check)Iraq asked the Security Council on Tuesday to easethe U.N. trade embargo by giving Baghdad permission to sell almost $1 billionworth of oil on world markets over the next four months to pay for emergencyimports of food and other essential humanitarian items.;    (check) Germanyannounced that it will nearly triple its financial aid -- to $165 million fromabout $58 million -- to help the Kurdish refugees and will send 40 militaryhelicopters to Iran and Turkey to distribute life-saving supplies.;    (check)In Iran, the Foreign Ministry said an Iraqi military brigade pulled out ofIran on Tuesday after penetrating two miles into Iranian territory Sunday,attacking refugees and killing an unspecified number of them.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910417  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,039  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 17, 199100108003,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
