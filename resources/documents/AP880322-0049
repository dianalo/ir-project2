A 79-0 vote on Monday approved a non-binding,sense-of-the-Senate resolution which declares that foreign fishingfleets are using a zone located between the 200-mile fishing limitsestablished by the United States and the Soviet Union as ``astaging ground for raids'' into one of the richest fishing groundsin the world.   According to the resolution, immediate action to protect BeringSea fishery resources is needed because of lack of cooperation byother high-seas fishing nations under existing agreements.   The resolution calls for the convening of U.S.-Sovietnegotiations to impose a moratorium on all fishing in the zone, aban which would stay in effect until an international fisherymanagement agreement is negotiated.   Because of its location, completely surrounded by U.S. andSoviet territorial waters, the 4,500 square mile area is knownvariously as ``the hole in the doughnut'' or ``the doughnut.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Group Demonstrates Against Use Of Animals In Research</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About a dozen people were arrested when theyattempted to block the entrance to the headquarters of theDepartment of Health and Human Services in a demonstration againstthe use of animals in medical research.
