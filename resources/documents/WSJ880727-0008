The lawyer, Alfred Elliott, 44 years old, is the first person indicted on insider trading charges to be accused of violating federal racketeering statutes, prosecutors said.    A former partner in the law firm of Schiff, Hardin andamp; Waite, Mr. Elliott was charged in a 70-count indictment with wire fraud, securities fraud, racketeering and filing a false income tax return. If convicted on all counts, he could be fined $13.5 million and forced to make restitution of any illegal profits.    The lawyer, now a Florida resident, couldn't be located for comment.    Mr. Elliott was one of 12 people named by a federal grand jury in indictments returned in three unrelated cases of alleged financial crimes.    Eight of those indicted were accused of participating in a $1.2 million scheme of &quot;churning&quot; accounts, a practice of brokers trading on customers' accounts merely to generate commissions.    The government said the alleged scheme was carried out by officers and employees of Whitehall Investors International Inc., based in Chicago with branches in Irvine, Calif., and Boca Raton, Fla. Those indicted include Walter S. Josten, an owner and president of Whitehall, who could face 105 years in prison if convicted. Mr. Josten couldn't be reached for comment.    Indictments also were returned against three people in a continuing investigation of trading violations at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The trio are accused of participating in fraudulent trading involving Jeffrey G. Donnelly, a former broker with CRT Services Inc. Mr. Donnelly pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud in February and was sentenced to three years in prison. </TEXT></DOC>
