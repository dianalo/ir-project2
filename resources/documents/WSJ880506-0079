Mr. Dennis, who has built a reputation for aggressively pursuing public corruption and white-collar crime cases during his five years in Philadelphia, has discussed the job with Mr. Meese. But a spokesman for the attorney general said only that Mr. Meese &quot;thinks highly&quot; of Mr. Dennis; the prosecutor's office declined to comment.    The name has been sent to the White House, but a decision isn't likely to be announced until background checks and talks with lawmakers are completed, probably next week, according to officials. Mr. Meese's choice was first reported in the New York Times.    While Mr. Meese is making progress in assembling a new management team, one of his top deputies, William Sessions, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, suggested that the accusations against the attorney general &quot;might weaken the fabric&quot; of overall respect for the law. While avoiding direct criticism of Mr. Meese, the FBI chief stressed during a briefing that &quot;the perception of the public is extremely important.&quot; If there was a perception that the FBI head wasn't &quot;properly, legally and ethically carrying out&quot; his responsibilities, Mr. Sessions added, &quot;I always have open the route of resignation for myself.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
