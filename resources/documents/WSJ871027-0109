Stung by attacks from Congress about widespread fraud in the nation's banking and thrift industries, the Justice Department sent a 40-person strike force to Texas last summer. A federal grand jury in Dallas has subpoenaed the records of more than 400 owners, managers and borrowers of savings and loan associations, and the Justice Department plans to impanel a second grand jury soon.    The aim is to &quot;sink a few deep shafts&quot; in Dallas to show the government's commitment to prosecuting bank frauds, says William Weld, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division. If those shafts hit pay dirt in Texas, the Justice Department may assemble task forces in Oklahoma and Arizona, too.    But the department's sudden interest in bank fraud after years of inaction strikes some critics as cynical-motivated as much by political pressure as by concern about crime. As recently as last February, only a handful of the 93 U.S. attorneys around the country responded to urgings from Washington to give bank fraud a higher priority. &quot;We're obviously responsive to complaints from lawmakers,&quot; concedes William Hendricks III, chief of the department's fraud section, without speculating on indictments.    The department's new attention to Texas may also be too little too late. There were 2,900 major bank-fraud investigations under way at the end of 1986 -- twice as many as there were in 1983. Reported losses rose 400% to $1.11 billion. But there was only a 30% increase in Federal Bureau of Investigation agents assigned to bank-fraud investigations in those three years, and bank-fraud and embezzlement convictions actually declined 8%.    Partly because of the backlog and a lack of success in the past, bank regulators until recently shied away from making criminal referrals to law-enforcement agencies. And law-enforcement officials concede that hundreds of pending investigations remained virtually ignored by the bureaucracy for years.    Moreover, critics and even some prosecutors say the government will have trouble scoring the kind of impressive, relatively quick victories it hopes for in the battle against financial fraud.    Some cases aren't complicated. &quot;Some of our referrals (to the FBI) are slam-dunks,&quot; says Rosemary Stewart, enforcement director of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. But other prosecutions are risky because they often are complex and difficult to win. Prosecutors often find that many jurors can't follow the intricacies of the cases, and defendants sometimes win sympathy from juries by blaming federal regulators for failing to curtail questionable banking practices in the first place.    In any broader effort, the sheer number of bank-fraud cases nationwide could overwhelm limited enforcement resources. &quot;The government's response is nothing compared to the virtual epidemic&quot; of embezzlement and other white-collar crimes confronting the Justice Department, contends consumer activist Ralph Nader. &quot;They really aren't able to cope with the major priorities at all.&quot;    But in Dallas, at least, there is an effort to get to the bottom of suspected serious violations. Thrift-industry regulators initially raised red flags last year when they uncovered large numbers of real estate loans by Texas Sandamp;Ls that didn't call for any down payments or interest charges. By selling some parcels of undeveloped land several times in one day among a small group of investors and thrift institutions, weak Sandamp;Ls were able to artificially inflate prices and obtain badly needed infusions of cash.    In the most flagrant cases, says Ms. Stewart of the Bank Board, some Texas thrifts were booking phony interest payments on loans as profit and using them to pay millions of dollars in dividends and bonuses to stockholders and top management. She notes that in a recent lawsuit the Bank Board alleged that, using such tactics, the now-defunct Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association obtained fancy California beach homes, purchased Rolls-Royces and leased a small fleet of private aircraft.    The government's efforts got a boost about two weeks ago when federal prosecutors announced indictments against the former chief executive officer of the failed Empire Savings andamp; Loan Association and six associates on conspiracy, racketeering and fraud charges. Federal officials previously filed dozens of charges in the case, but were criticized for failing to obtain indictments against some of the top figures in the alleged scheme to defraud five federally insured thrifts of more than $100 million.    The increased federal interest in bank fraud has produced other results. There is better training to help bank and thrift examiners detect fraud. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. now requires banks or examiners to call in criminal prosecutors as soon as foul play is suspected. And a computer tracking system has been developed to follow the progress -- or lack of it -- of pending criminal cases.    Whatever the outcome of the Texas initiative, former prosecutor Robert Serino, deputy chief counsel for the comptroller of the currency, sees substantial progress toward cooperation between regulators and Justice Department officials. &quot;You are going to find glitches throughout the system,&quot; he says, &quot;but the whole system ought not to be indicted.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
