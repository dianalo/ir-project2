Get the picture? Well, there's more.   The Was would also like to extend their appreciation to singersSweet Pea Atkinson and Harry Bowen, rocker Elvis Costello and FrankSinatra Jr., all contributors to the group's third album, ``What Up,Dog?''   Still confused? Then go back about 20 years when two young smartalecks named Donald Fagenson and David Weiss were growing up in thesuburbs of Detroit. The story begins with our heroes in eighth gradegym class.   This is where Moonie Krupka comes in.   ``Some of the students were using tumbling equipment withoutsupervision,'' Weiss recalled in an interview at the Manhattanoffices of Chrysalis Records. ``When the teacher found out he askedwho had done it. Don and I decided to withhold information, but aguy named Moonie Krupka ratted on us. We met outside the teacher'soffice.''   And so the friendship was born _ Weiss, the poet who could notremember lyrics to the Motown hits sung in the school bathrooms, andFagenson, the natural musician experimenting with multi-trackrecordings at age 14.   They each attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, buteventually went their separate ways. Weiss headed west and became ajazz critic for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.   ``I fancied myself a writer,'' Weiss said. ``I was really just abig jazz fan.''   Fagenson, meanwhile, took to the ``trenches'' in Detroit, doingstudio work and performing Gilbert O'Sullivan songs (``Alone Again,Naturally,'' ``Get Down'') in local bars.   ``I was at wits end,'' Fagenson recalled. ``You can only do somuch hackwork. It'll drive you nuts, especially if you have astatement you've got to make. I felt the moment slipping away. Icalled David and said, `Let's go down in glory.'''   So in 1980, Was (Not Was) was formed. The name being inspired bynone other than Don's little boy, who had invented phrases such as``Blue (Not Blue)'' and ``Hot (Not Hot).''   The Was write most of the group's material and also play a numberof instruments, including keyboards, flute, harmonica and mandolin.For singers, they recruited Atkinson and Bowen, who had beenperforming backing vocals at the Sound Suite.   Clinton, mastermind of Parliament-Funkadelic, enters the storybecause his music and satirical style of writing are powerfulinfluences on Was (Not Was).   ``George Clinton played at our high school dance when his groupwas still called the Parliaments,'' Weiss said. ``They came andlip-synced `I Just Wanna Testify' at our dance. He was obviously thefirst black hippie anybody had ever seen so he really made quite animpact.''   With the help of a friendly jazz critic, Was (Not Was) managed toget signed to Ze Records, an independent label, in 1980.   ``I violated journalistic ethics by sending the demo to ZeRecords with a cover letter record from myself as a critic sayingyou must listen to these guys,'' Weiss confessed.   The ploy worked. Zilkha, the president of Ze, liked Was (Not Was)and the group's self-titled debut album came out in 1981.   The record sold poorly, however, and Was (Not Was) tried its luckthe following year with Geffen Records, formed by David Geffen, whohad helped discover the Eagles and Jackson Browne among many others.It was, in Weiss' words, ``The beginning of the end of thebeginning.''   ``We came in as this pan-ethnic dance act, this heterosexual`Village People,''' Weiss said. ``Geffen's people thought in termsof hit records. `Get rid of the black guys (Atkinson and Bowen),'they told us. `You're blue-eyed soul. You need a Paul Young or DarylHall to front the group.'''   Out of this promising relationship came the group's sole albumfor Geffen, ``Born to Laugh at Tornadoes,'' released in 1983. Therecord bombed and Was (Not Was) spent the next two years trying toget out of its contract.   ``We were pariahs at our own record companies,'' Weiss said.   Was (Not Was) did manage to have a couple of hits in Europe andis now happily signed with Chrysalis records. ``What Up, Dog?'' is amix of funky tracks such as ``Spy'' and ``Anytime Lisa,'' theoff-the-wall ``Earth to Doris'' (featuring Weiss' anguished vocals)and the heartfelt ``Love Can be Bad Luck.''   Sinatra can be heard crooning ``Wedding Vows in Las Vegas,'' aless-than-romantic look at life in the gambling mecca.   ``It was a case of him seeing the song and being glad he had anoriginal piece of music that he could relate to,'' said Fagenson,inspired to use the singer after seeing his name on a marquee.``There was a great deal of pathos in that lyric. It's a sad placeand I thought he captured it.''   Now that they are commercial successes, fans will no doubt wantto know Weiss and Fagenson's secret to writing hit singles.   Explained Weiss: ``We're the first audience for each other. Ithink our relationship is like a great author's relationship withhis publisher where you really need that third eye on things. If wecan prove this to each other, we can prove it to the audience atlarge because we're so tough on each other.''   Added Fagenson: ``He's just a lazy guy; he won't compose until hehas words.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions Jan 13-15</NOTE></DOC>
