The dollar rose slightly against the yen andshare prices fell again.   The dollar closed at 129.73 yen, up 0.43 yen from Thursday'sclose of 129.30 yen. After opening at 129.85 yen, it ranged from129.63 yen to 129.95 yen.   On the Tokyo stock exchange, trading was sluggish with volume onthe first section at 300 million.   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished at 23,171.63 points,down 315.85 points or 1.34 percent from Thursday's close at23,487.48 points.   But the subdued trading, totaling $5.97 billion in spottransactions, lacked direction in the absence of freshmarket-affecting news, brokers said.   Market players are still waiting on the sidelines for a changein the Persian Gulf situation, traders said. The dollar tends to bestrong at times of international tension, while the yen isweakened.   Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said someinvestors are waiting for a series of U.S. economic reportsscheduled for release today.   But many traders did not foresee a radical plunge in the dollareven if the Federal Reserve makes the long-anticipated move tolower interest rates.   Hiroyuki Takabe, a dealer at Yasuda Trust and Banking, said thesubsequent profit-taking may even encourage a rush to buy dollars,unless the federal fund rate - the rate banks charge each other forovernight loans - is lowered by more than .25 percent.   Masunori Ishitobi, a researcher at Sanyo Securities Co., saidthe blue chip average was adjusting after a 1,041.87-point jumpTuesday, following the three-day weekend. Last week, the Nikkeished 1,033.95 points in three trading days, dropping to a22,931.80-point close last Friday.   Yoshiyuki Nishiguchi, a dealer at Daiwa Securities Co., noted aconsistent pattern recently for share prices to pick up in theearlier part of the week, then plunge as the trading week ended.   Nishiguchi said market players turn cautious because ``there's afeeling that anything can happen over the weekend.''
