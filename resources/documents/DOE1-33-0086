Root-mean-square deviations of fluctuations ofreduced frequency difference decrease with increase of averaging timeaccording to the degree law and grow with approach to the Sun as R/sup-1.9/. The regular shift of reduced frequency difference, conditionedby radio beam movement with respect to the sun was observed. The spatialspectrum of plasma turbulence is similar to the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrumfor fluctuation frequencies 4x10/sup -3/{le}{gamma}{le} 2x10/sup -1/Hz.</TEXT></DOC>
