Separately, Osamu Nobuto, the head of Mazda's U.S. manufacturing operations, said Mazda is weighing expansion of its vehicle-making capabilities in at least two areas, engines and trucks.    U.S. truck assembly is a &quot;good idea&quot; in light of the 25% tariff on imported trucks, Mr. Nobuto said. He cautioned that no final decisions have been made on that move, or on proposals to add an engine plant to Mazda's Flat Rock, Mich., car-assembly plant. Mazda has room to grow at Flat Rock, having purchased about 100 acres of additional land around the plant.    Mazda's decision to shake up its U.S. marketing operations follows similar moves by other Japanese car makers to gain closer control of their sales networks. In addition, Subaru of America Inc., the U.S. importer and distributor of vehicles made by Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan, bought eight of its 12 independent U.S. distributors and plans to buy the remaining four of July 1.    The new U.S. sales unit, Mazda Motor of America Inc., will be 50%-owned by its Japanese parent. Sumitomo Corp. and C. Itoh andamp; Co., the Japanese trading houses, will own 30% and 20% respectively. As part of the reorganization, Mazda said it will lay off about 70 workers in its Jacksonville, Fla., distribution center.    Mazda Motor of America replaces three separate distribution organizations. Mazda Motors of America (Central) Inc., half owned by Sumitomo, distributed cars and trucks in 31 Western states. Mazda Motors of America (East) Inc., half owned by C. Itoh, handled 18 Eastern states. A third company, Shelly Motors Inc., controlled Hawaiian distribution.    Under the old system, the distribution companies had separate managements, separate business strategies and separate allotments of cars. The central and east organizations sometimes vied to get larger shares of Mazda's product, and they complicated national advertising strategy, since all advertising had to be approved by consensus of the distributors, company officials said.    &quot;One of the great beneficiaries of the consolidation will be our advertising agency. There'll be less people in the decision making process,&quot; said George McCabe, the new unit's group vice president and deputy general manager for marketing and sales.    Mazda's annual U.S. advertising budget is estimated at $50 million, and is handled by Foote, Cone andamp; Belding's Los Angeles office. Mr. McCabe said there aren't any plans to switch agencies or to greatly expand the ad budget next year.    In a related announcement, Mazda said it is consolidating its North American research and development operations into a single new unit, Mazda Research andamp; Development of North America Inc.    Mazda, which has seen its share of all U.S. car sales increase to 2.4% from 1.7% a year ago, expects its car and truck sales here to rise 14% by 1990 to 422,000 vehicles. The company plans to build two models at Flat Rock next year for sale through its U.S. dealer network, compared with the single model currently assembled there. Flat Rock also builds the sporty Probe car sold by Ford Motor Co. </TEXT></DOC>
