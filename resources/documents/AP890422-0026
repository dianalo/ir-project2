Their children huddle close by. Some clutch torn plastic bagsand rusting buckets to carry the rations home; others simply stickout cupped hands.   They are among the women and children in Kabul most affected bythe 11-year civil war. Only the poorest of them are eligible forthe emergency rations distributed by a U.N relief program calledOperation Salaam, or Peace.   Relief workers say they don't know how much longer they will beable to help because their stockpile will be depleted by the end ofApril.   ``We make no illusions that we are even able to begin to handlethe need. We are not solving the problem,'' said Ross Mountain,director of the United Nations Development Program.   Since February, relief workers have handed out 22-pound bags offlour and 6{-pound bags of sugar, as well as some medicine andblankets, to about 33,500 families.   They also have provided fertilizer to farmers hoping to startplanting crops in fields destroyed by fighting between Afghanforces and Moslem guerrillas trying to oust the Soviet-backedgovernment.   Afghanistan was self-sufficient in food before civil war brokeout following a Marxist coup in April 1978. The fighting hasdestroyed fields and orchards and forced the government to importabout 1 million tons of wheat annually.   Relief workers say fertilizer also will be gone within days.   Moscow donated 175 tons of wheat and flour and about 235 tons ofsugar to Operation Salaam.   The Development Program is one of five U.N. organizationsinvolved in the relief effort. The others are the Aid Coordinator'sOffice, UNICEF, the High Commission for Refugees and the World FoodBank.   Dozens of Soviet military transport planes descend daily on thecapital from sunrise to sunset, but the blue-and-white aircrafteach carry only about 25 tons of food and supplies. The rest of thecargo is weapons and ammunition.   The Soviets ended nine years of intervention in Afghanistan whenthey withdrew the last of their troops on Feb. 15. Westerncountries that withdrew from Afghanistan before that time do notrecognize the government of President Najib and have refused tohelp it.   The United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China back theguerrillas, known as mujahedeen.   Bread lines at Kabul bakeries that once stretched for blockshave eased, and there are plenty of fruits and vegetables in themarkets. But food prices have risen dramatically and the poorcannot afford them.   The cost of 15{ pounds of flour has risen from about 40 cents inJanuary to $3.25 today.   Heavy snow and rebel attacks at times have cut off two vitalsupply routes to Kabul, a city of 2.2 million people _ the Salanghighway running north to the Soviet border and the Jalalabadhighway east to Pakistan.   Fighting between government forces and the guerrillas closed theSalang highway for nearly two weeks this month. A 1,300-truckconvoy was stalled about 30 miles north of Kabul and dozens ofcontainers of food rotted on the Soviet border.   Convoys also have had trouble traveling between Pakistan andKabul because of the guerrilla assault on Jalalabad. The insurgentshave pounded the city with heavy artillery and tens of thousands ofrockets since March 6.   The Soviet airlift has enabled the government to hold outagainst the guerrillas, but it supplies less than half the 650 tonsof flour that Kabul needs daily.   Guerrilla leaders operating from Pakistan originally said theywould take power in Afghanistan within weeks after the Sovietpullout.   However, government troops have managed to repulse theirassaults on Jalalabad, and diplomats say the insurgents now hope tostarve major cities such as Jalalabad and Kabul into surrendering.</TEXT></DOC>
