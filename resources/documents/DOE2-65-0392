Preliminary results haveconfirmed both intensity and resolution predictions indicating that ({delta}d/d)lies between 0.04 % and 0.08 % for all d-spacings between 0.02 and 5A. The scientific potential of this increased resolution over existingtime-of-flight diffractometers has been demonstrated in the successfulab initio structure determination of an unknown inorganic material, FeAsO/sub4/, and the detailed study of subtle symmetry changes in NiO. The trueinstrumental resolution, however, has been observed in only a small numberof experiments: sample broadening is often seen to play a dominant rolein the determination of the peak shape, particularly at longer d-spacings.This leads to additional useful information about macroscopic properties,such as an anisotropic crystallite size, strain distribution and samplehomogeneity, but also results in a significant increase in complexityof peak-shape description and data-analysis strategy.
