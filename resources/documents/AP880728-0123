After the performance Wednesday night, an international cast ofsingers and musicians under the direction of Paris Orchestraconductor Daniel Barenboim received enthusiastic applause. For thefirst time this year, the orchestra includes 11 musicians fromcommunist East Germany.   But East German director Harry Kupfer, who attempted to turn theold German myths into a symbolic depiction of the modern world,drew boos.   Kupfer, according to the Hamburg-based weekly Stern magazine, isseeking to present the Wagnerian tragedies as a portrayal ofpresent times by showing ``aspects of our threatened world.''   ``The audience should learn something,'' the magazine quotedKupfer as saying. ``They must not just close their eyes and enjoythe beautiful music. They should reflect on the meaning.''   Kupfer set his production in modern times and on a modernstreet, which he says is ``part of the traveled road in humanhistory.''   Stage settings are built of bits and pieces of ordinary,every-day materials.   A dragon's cave, where the stolen Rhine gold is stashed, is madefrom an old piece of sewer piping. Valhalla, the home of the gods,is presented as a cube of neon lights, suspended above asmoke-covered stage floor.   The gods travel to and from their Valhalla home in arainbow-colored, glass-enclosed elevator.   Modern social themes were also woven into Kopfer's presentation.   The three goddesses of fate are portrayed as Bedouin gypsywomen, weaving their threads of fortune from 42 television antennas.   Kupfer said the use of trenchcoats and other types of overcoatsfor costumes is intended to depict ``the cold discomfort of thehomeless.''   The opening performance marked the 600th presentation of the``Ring Cycle'' at the Bayreuth festival, and the second attempt atbringing the Wagnerian tragedies into a modern setting.   In 1976, French director Patrice Chereau directed a productionof the opera set in the 19th century, which, like Kupfer'soffering, was booed by the audience and received negative reviews.   Wagner's ``Ring Cycle'' will be performed three times at thisyear's festival, which ends August 29. Tickets for all of thefestival performances have been sold out since November.</TEXT></DOC>
