(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former PTL official said he told afederal grand jury that he had sex with former PTL leader JimBakker, but Bakker has denied the allegation in court.   Jay Babcock, the former director of creative television for thetroubled ministry, commented Tuesday after being asked questions bythe grand jury apparently designed to determine whether PTL moneywas paid for sexual favors.   Babcock was the first man to publicly acknowledge telling thegrand jury of a sexual encounter with Bakker.   Calls by The Associated Press to Bakker's phone number in FortMill, S.C., went unanswered Tuesday night.   In August, Bakker denied under oath that he had ever had ahomosexual relationship.   Told by a reporter Tuesday outside the federal courthouse thatBakker had denied ever having a homosexual relationship withanyone, Babcock replied: ``I'm saying he's a liar.''   Babcock told reporters Monday that he expected to be questionedby prosecutors about ``whether I had sex with the boss.''   On Tuesday, after testifying much of the afternoon, Babcock wasasked by a reporter, ``What did you say regarding sex with JimBakker?''   His response: ``I commented that `yes, it happened _ a long timeago.'''   Babcock said prosecutors also wanted to know about thecircumstances surrounding that encounter. ``I'm not willing to talkabout those,'' he told reporters.   Babcock also told reporters that prosecutors asked him whetherBakker and his personal aide, David Taggart, had a sexualrelationship.   ``I have no first-hand knowledge of that,'' Babcock said.   PTL records show that Taggart drew more than $620,000 from PTLin a 15-month period that ended in March 1987 _ the same monthBakker resigned as PTL's president after acknowledging that he hada 1980 sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn and that money had beenpaid to silence her.   Bakker and his top aides are under investigation for possiblemail, wire and tax fraud.   The grand jury probe, now in its second year, is focusing andwhether Bakker and other ministry leaders violated federal laws byraising money through the mails or on television for one purposeand then spending it for another.   Bakker was dismissed by the Assemblies of God denomination inMay 1987 for unbecoming conduct related to his sexual encounterwith Ms. Hahn and because of ``alleged misconduct involvingbisexual activity.''   In May 1987, the Rev. Jerry Falwell told reporters that GarySmith, PTL's former general manager, was the target of one ofBakker's alleged homosexual advances.   Smith testified before the grand jury for about six hoursMonday, but refused to discuss what he said. He acknowledged,however, that the subject of homosexuality was discussed.   John Wesley Fletcher, the evangelist who introduced Ms. Hahn, aformer church secretary, to Bakker, testified for about three hoursTuesday. He also refused to tell reporters what happened inside thegrand jury room.   Asked whether he had ever had a sexual relationship with Bakker,Fletcher replied: ``No comment.''   Fletcher's attorney, Allen Bailey, told reporters: ``His failureto comment doesn't indicate anything, gentlemen. His failure tocomment is simply that he cannot discuss what went on in the grandjury room.''   PTL filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy code inJune 1987. A bankruptcy trustee has been attempting to find a buyerfor the Fort Mill, S.C., ministry, which includes a Christian themepark and real estate.   A bid by Bakker for PTL apparently fell apart when Bakkercouldn't prove he had the necessary financial backing.</TEXT></DOC>
