President Bushannounced the disbanding of U.S. sanctions, but the DanishParliament is holding up the European Community's decision toend its economic restrictions against South Africa, officialssay.   Moreover a scandal relating to South African Governmentfunding of Inkatha, a black political organization inopposition to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress,will discourage some foreign companies from trading withSouth Africa, analysts say.   Nevertheless, regardless of the furor, apartheid is doomedand it is only a matter of time before South Africa movestowards non-racial democracy, analysts say. As a result,international sanctions are likely to end soon, they say.   &quot;Without political restraints, South African exports canonly improve in the long term,&quot; says Tom Main, chiefexecutive of the nation's Chamber of Mines. Mining companieswill be free to negotiate deals normally, he says.   The South African gold industry intends to relaunch theKrugerrand, a gold coin in one-ounce and smallerdenominations that dominated the international coin marketbefore sanctions were imposed in 1985, Mr. Main says. Between1967 and 1985 about 42 million ounces of Krugerrands weresold, he says.   &quot;We are free to sell Krugerrands in the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Mainsays, &quot;but are still waiting for the go-ahead from Europe andJapan before we begin our campaign.&quot;   Illustrating its new lack of inhibition, the South AfricanChamber of Mines negotiated a &quot;cooperation agreement&quot; withthe Soviet Union, a historic enemy and major competitor inthe platinum, gold and diamond markets. The agreementeffectively demolished the barriers that prevented the twoleading producers from exchanging technology and expertise,the chamber said.   Both the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and the South Africansdenied that there would be collusion in sales of gold andplatinum, but for years dealers speculated that there wouldeventually be cooperation.   Meanwhile, South African coal mining companies and IscorLtd., the nation's main iron and steel producer, aim atregaining market share that they lost to sanctions. As theworld's third largest coal exporter after Australia and theU.S., South Africa has the capacity to ship 44 million metrictons a year, the Chamber of Mines says. While under sanctionsit sold the commodity at huge discounts and built up marketsin Taiwan and other Asian countries.   Europe will be the main target for rising South Africancoal exports, analysts say, but Japan is a buyer of SouthAfrican coal, and there will be fierce competition withAustralian, U.S. and Canadian producers in the Far East.   South African steel producers will also be competing withAustralia for access to European and U.S. markets, an Iscorspokesman says. A sales network that was in place beforeSouth Africa's isolation, will be revived speedily, he says.   &quot;In general, Australians don't perceive that South Africais a threat to their markets,&quot; says Reg Eccles, managingdirector, Europe, of Australian stockbroker Ord Minnett.Rising wages and post-apartheid difficulties will depressSouth Africa's mining production, Australian miningexecutives say.   &quot;Yet this is a dangerous assumption,&quot; Mr. Eccles says.Japanese coal and steel buyers, for example, might decide toensure their long-term supplies by investing in South Africanmines and refineries, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
