The proposed limits on exposure to methylenedianiline resultedfrom the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's firstattempt at mediated rulemaking, a procedure which included acommittee consisting of government, industry and labor unionrepresentatives.   Methylenedianiline, known as MDA, is a potential carcinogenfound in chemicals and plastics such as polyurethane foam andvarious coatings, resins, adhesives and sealants used inconstruction.   OSHA, an arm of the Labor Department, proposed setting anexposure limit of 10 parts of MDA for every billion parts of airover an normal eight-hour workday.   The proposed guidelines, subject to public comment before theytake effect, also would require workers exposed to MDA at half theacceptable level be monitored for potential health effects andprovided training on limiting their exposure.   Workers exposed to MDA at half the acceptable limit or ingreater amounts would be required to shower immediately after workand have their skin inspected for exposure. Prolonged exposure toMDA turns skin yellow.   Areas where the substance is used also would be regulated, withemployers required to provide workers with protective clothing andrespiratory equipment and to keep detailed records of MDA use.   OSHA, which published the proposed limits in Friday's FederalRegister, said about 4,000 workers are exposed to MDA in theirjobs. It would cost an estimated $8.2 million a year for all firmsusing MDA in general industry to meet the limits and about $650,000a year for construction employers to comply, the government said.   The process that led to the OSHA action dates back to 1983, whenOSHA and the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans tolimit exposure to MDA. OSHA subsequently determined the substanceposed substantial risk to worker health and in 1986 formed thecommittee that, after seven meetings, drafted the proposed limits.</TEXT></DOC>
