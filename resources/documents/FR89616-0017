Amendment 4 addresses the allocation of total allowable catch (TAC) forAtlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel (76 percent conmercial and 24percent recreational) which has contributed to early recreational closuresand adverse socioeconomic impacts. For Atlantic migratory group Spanishmackerel, Amendment 4 addresses this problem by establishing a procedureto change the allocation to 50 percent recreational and 50 percent commercialas the TAC increases. Draft Amendment 4 was prepared and distributed to interested parties inSeptember and October, 1988. Public hearings were held on the draft amendmentin 10 cities from Key West, FL to Manteo, NC in October 1988. After considerationof the comments received at the public hearings and Council meetings, writtenpublic comments, and comments from their Scientific and Statistical Committeesand Advisory Panels, the Councils made their final selection of preferredoptions at the April 1989 joint Council meeting. The issues, their impacts,and the rationale for the Councils' preferred options are summarized below.A more complete analysis appears in Amendment 4, the availability of whichwas published in the<T4> Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 23238, May 31, 1989). <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The current allocation of TAC of 76 percent to commercial fishermen and24 percent to recreational fishermen in the Atlantic migratory group Spanishmackerel fishery does not reflect the allocation that existed during theearly to mid 1970's when the fishery was not overfished. The current allocationwas based on recreational catch data from 1979-85, a period during whichthe resource was overfished and when recreational catches and participationwere low due to the status of the resource. This allocation has contributedto the early implementation of zero bag limits for the recreational fisherywhich results in negative socioeconomic impacts to recreational fishermen.<T3>Issue 1. </T3>Atlantic Migratory Group Spanish Mackerel Commercialand Recreational Allocations Current regulations establish an allocation of TAC of 76 percent commercialand 24 percent recreational based on catch data from 1979-85. The Councilsconcluded that this is inappropriate because the resource was overfishedand the recreational share depressed during this time period. New allocationsare proposed to more equitably allocate Atlantic migratory group Spanishmackerel between recreational and commercial users. The Councils considered three options: Option 1 (status quo)_continue the76 percent commercial and 24 percent recreational allocation; Option 2_reallocatebased on estimated average ratios of catches in the period from 1967-74;and Option 3_reallocate 50 percent commercial and 50 percent recreational.The Councils concluded that the current allocation (76 percent commercialand 24 percent recreational) is inappropriate and selected Option 3 because:1. The Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel resource was overfishedand the resulting recreational catches depressed during the years 1979-85which were used to establish the current allocation. 2. Commercial catches increased during the mid 1970's and the distributionof the resource between recreational and commercial users changed withmore being taken commercially. This is also the time when the abundanceof the resource began to decline and become more geographically compressed.Recreational catches in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina wereaffected and in these States recreational harvest had previously accountedfor the majority of the harvest. 3. The Councils believe, based on the expert knowledge of State fisherydirectors and other Council members directly associated with the fishery,that recreational catches were higher in the 1970's but quantitative informationto support this conclusion is limited. The limited quantitative data fromthe early 1970's indicates that the Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerelresource was distributed equally (i.e., 50/50) between the recreationaland commercial user groups. Qualitative information such as input fromfishermen and the recent reemergence of catches north of North Carolina,indicate that Spanish mackerel are now repopulating this area, as theyhave in the past, thereby lending support to the Councils' conclusion ofhigher recreational catches during the 1970's. 4. Now that the Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel resource is reducedand harvest capacity and demand of both user groups has expanded to thepoint that either group could harvest all or most of the available resource,the Councils believe it is more equitable to allocate the resource equallybetween users. 5. Based on the above, the Councils concluded that a 50/50 allocation wouldresult in benefits greater than costs and maximize the net socioeconomicbenefits available from the Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel resource.<T3>Issue 2. </T3>Method of Implementing Revised Allocations of AtlanticMigratory Group Spanish Mackerel The Councils considered five options: Option 1_implement the 50/50 reallocationwith an effective date when TAC is relatively low and relatively late inthe fishing year; Option 2_implement the revised ratios to be effectivewith the seasonal adjustment for the next fishing year; Option 3_implementthe reallocation only as the TAC is increased by providing the increaseto the gaining group until the new 50/50 ratio is established. No reductionin any group's allocation would occur unless TAC was subsequently reduced,in which case the existing ratio would apply to the reduced TAC; Option4 _same as Option 3 except that, in the event of a  reduction in TAC, theexisting ratio would be applied to the amount of the reduction; and Option5_implement the reallocation only for the TAC increase above the levelwhich results in a 3.04-million pound commercial allocation, by providing90 percent of any increase to the recreational allocation and 10 percentto the commercial allocation until the new ratio is established. No reductionin any group's allocation would occur unless the TAC was subsequently reduced,in which case the ratio in place at that time would apply. However, the50/50 ratio would be implemented no later than the 1994/95 fishing year.The Councils selected Option 5 because this mechanism best moderates anynegative socioeconomic impacts the reallocation may have on the commercialsector and provides a gradual redistribution (as long as the TAC changesgradually) without decreasing any group's existing quota. This implementationprocedure establishes a base level of 3.04 million pounds for the commercialfishery, that is, 76 percent of the TAC for the 1988/89 fishing year. TheCouncils have recommended a TAC of 6 million pounds for the 1989/90 fishingyear. The increase in the TAC of 2.0 million pounds is to be shared with10 percent (0.2 million pounds) going to the commercial allocation and90 percent (1.8 million pounds) going to the recreational allocation. Theresulting allocations for the 1989/90 fishing year, assuming increasedTAC and Amendment 4 are approved, would be:<ITAG tagnum="15">TAC=6.0 million pounds </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Commercial allocation=3.24 million pounds (54 percent) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Recreational Allocation=2.76 million pounds (46 percent)</ITAG>It is the Councils' intent that these allocations take effect when Amendment4 is approved and implemented. Throughout the procedural development andpreparation of Amendment 4, it had been the Councils' expressed intentthat the revised allocations be in place prior to the 1989/90 fishing year.Unfortunately, due to procedural delays, this was not possible. However,the Councils have concluded that, based on the urgent nature of reallocationunder increasing TACs, this action is justified and have requested thatthe final rule specifying TACs and allocations for the 1989/90 fishingyear indicate that Amendment 4 proposes to alter the Atlantic Spanish mackerelallocations.If Amendment 4 is approved, implementation would be needed by the beginningof November. Since the majority of the commercial harvest does not occuruntil December/January each year, commercial catches should not exceedthe 3.24-million pound level prior to implementation of Amendment 4. Ifunforeseen circumstances were to occur, and the commercial harvest wereto exceed the 3.24-million pound level before Amendment 4 is implemented,it is the intent of the Councils that the commercial fishery be closedand the remaining TAC be applied to the recreational allocation upon implementationof Amendment 4. The Councils concluded that this implementation procedure is fair and equitableto the commercial sector because a commercial allocation of 3.24 millionpounds would exceed the average of the 1970-74 catches (3,098,600 pounds),the period prior to the large increase in commercial catches of the midto late 1970's. The Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel resourceis believed to have not been overfished during this time period and allocatingthe commercial sector a base amount exceeding what they were catching atthat time would be fair to them. Allocating most of the remainder to therecreational sector, would also be fair to that user group. In addition,providing 10 percent of the increase to the commercial sector allows themto share in the benefits of rebuilding the resource while still progressingtoward the 50/50 allocation. A commercial quota of 3.24 million pounds for the 1989/90 fishing yearwould be a reduction of 41 percent from the 1979-86 average catch or 23percent from the average of 1981-86. It only represents a reduction of1 percent from the 1984-86 average catch but a 13 percent increase overthe l986-87 average catch. Foregone earnings to the commercial sector canbe estimated by comparing the allocation with the 76/24 ratio (4.56 millionpounds) to the allocation with the interim ratio (3.24 million pounds).The difference is 1.32 million pounds with an estimated ex-vessel valueof approximately $450,000. On the recreational side, the methodology toanalyze the benefits from doubling the allocation has been developed butwork in this area has not been conducted. However, estimates of total annualgains of between $2.5 and $25.5 million were obtained for Gulf king mackerelby doubling the allocation. The Councils concluded that the resulting impact on the commercial sectorwill not be significant during the period when the recreational allocationis allowed to increase to the level of the commercial allocation. In actuality,because of the increase in TAC proposed for this fishing year (1989/90),the value of the commercial allocation should increase over last fishingyear (1988/89) by approximately $68,000. The proposed changes to 50 CFR 642.21 in this action are an illustrationof the preferred methodology explained above. The illustration is basedon the implementation of a TAC of 6.0 million pounds for Atlantic groupSpanish mackerel for the 1989/90 fishing year that is being proposed ina separate proceeding (see 54 FR 24920, June 12, 1989). NOAA proposes touse the preferred methodology to derive the final changes to 50 CFR 642.21.If no increased TAC is implemented, no changes are proposed to be madeto 50 CFR 642.21. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>Section 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Act, as amended by Pub. L. 99-659,requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulations proposedby a Council within 15 days of receipt of an FMP amendment and regulations.At this time, the Secretary has not determined that Amendment 4, whichthis proposed rule would implement, is consistent with the national standards,other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary,in making that determination, will take into account the data, views, andcomments received during the comment period. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, determined that thisproposed rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring the preparation of a regulatoryimpact analysis under E.O. 12291. This proposed rule, if adopted, is notlikely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; ora significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of U.5.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. The Councils prepared a regulatory impact review which concludes that thisrule will have the economic effects discussed above in the analysis ofthe management measures of Amendment 4. A copy of the review may be obtainedat the address listed above.This proposed rule is exempt from the procedures of E.O. 12291 under section8(a)(2) of that order. It is' being reported to the Director, Office ofManagement and Budget, with an explanation of why it is not possible tofollow the procedures of that order. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesfor the following reasons. The commercial sector will be allocated an amountin excess of their average catch from 1970-74 when the resource was notoverfished. In addition, the current allocation represents a 13 percentincrease over the 1986-87 average catch. As a result, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis was not prepared. The Councils determined that this rule will be implemented in a mannerthat is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approvedcoastal zone management programs of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Georgia and Texas do not have approvedcoastal zone management programs. This determination has been submittedfor review by the responsible State agencies under section 307 of the CoastalZone Management Act. The Councils prepared an environmental assessment (EA) that discusses theimpact on the environment as a result of this rule. A copy of the EA maybe obtained at the address listed above and comments on it are requested.This proposed rule does not contain a collection of-information requirementfor purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O.12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 642 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
