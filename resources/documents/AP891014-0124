In the other semifinal, former world champion Anatoly Karpovheld on to draw his sixth game with fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in46 moves and keep the score at 3-3.   Speelman, playing black, staged his dramatic comeback after poorplay in his first six games. It came at a time when observers werebegining to write off his chances in the eight-game contest.   ``Jon played just like his old self,'' said an ecstatic JonathanTisdall, an international master who is Speelman's chief second.``As soon as he had a chance he played sharply and veryaggressively.''   Despite playing with the advantage of the white pieces, Karpov,who was world champion from 1975 until 1985, drifted into anunfavorable endgame where experts said Yusupov missed two chancesto win his second game in a row and go ahead in the contest.   ``I've never seen Karpov play so badly,'' said BritishGrandmaster Tony Miles.   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge worldchampion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game duel beginningin October 1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in theCandidates' final next March.   If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, a two-game ``mini match''will be played, followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakersplayed at increasingly high speeds.   A win scores one point and a draw a half.   Speelman shocked observers on the third move when he played anold defense against Timman's Ruy Lopez opening rarely seen intop-flight chess for the last 60 years.   Surprised by the unusual idea, Timman sank deep into thought,but a faulty 16th move let Speelman seize the initiative. Timmanused up more and more time and left himself with only 26 minutes'thinking time for 20 moves.   As Speelman turned on the pressure, Timman cracked. His 27thmove led to a sequence of moves in which Speelman won a bishop.   When Timman resigned, the crowd in the Sadler's Wells ballettheater rose for a standing ovation, but with the two Soviets stilllocked in battle, Speelman gestured to the crowd to be quiet.   After Speelman left the stage, Timman remained in his seat forfive minutes and watched the Karpov-Yusupov game on the electronicdemonstration boards.   Asked about his chances to win the contest, Speelman said,``better than this morning.''   From a Queen's Gambit, Yusupov produced a new idea on the 17thmove and gradually outplayed Karpov by combining threats againsthis king and in the center.   By the 30th move, the protagonists had exchanged down to anendgame with rooks and pawns, where Yusupov stood a pawn ahead.   Soviet International Master Mark Dvoretsky, Yusupov's chiefsecond, told reporters Yusupov missed two ways to win on moves 37and 38. When Yusupov missed his chances, Karpov initiated a seriesof pawn exchanges that led to an easily drawn position.   The eighth game with Speelman playing white against Timman isscheduled for Monday, although Timman has the option to take atimeout and postpone the game until Tuesday.   With their timeouts exhausted, Yusupov will play white againstKarpov in their seventh game on Monday. The eighth game will be onTuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
