Various people have demonstratedthat although this proposition is correct, it does not enable one tosay that marginal cost pricing by the electricity industry alone is agood thing. On the other hand, the general theory does not disprove thatmarginal cost pricing in only one part of the economy is a good thing;it merely fails to prove it, which is very different. In the authors'view, the case for marginal cost pricing of electricity is better madein down to earth terms.</TEXT></DOC>
