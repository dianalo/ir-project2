At the end of last year, only one Italian bank was counted among the world's 50 biggest banks in terms of assets, compared with 21 Japanese, seven West German and five French banks, and four each in the U.S. and the U.K., Mr. Dini told an international conference on financial deregulation and 1992, organized by Salomon Brothers International Ltd.    The central bank's policy is to encourage concentration and competition simultaneously.    &quot;A banking system with a smaller number of larger banks offering a broad range of products will involve more overlapping and competition than one comprising units of widely differing size, each aimed at a particular segment of (the) market,&quot; he said.    He argued that creation of larger banks will lead to higher efficiency, because of economies of scale, and that an increase in size is a requirement for banks that want to expand abroad.    He forecast that the recent trend of mergers, especially among local savings banks, will continue as banks try to &quot;achieve at least a minimum regional dimension.&quot;    Mr. Dini also cited a legislative proposal before parliament that calls for the transformation of public sector banks into joint stock companies, which have easier access to capital markets to raise money for investments. The measure, which was approved by the government last month, also gives numerous tax breaks to encourage growth.    The central bank official also called for legislation regarding the separation of financial and manufacturing industries. Currently, the Bank of Italy has an unwritten rule that industrial concerns can't own more than about 15% of a bank. &quot;Following the example of other countries, a procedure for the transfers of significant holdings of bank shares may prove desirable,&quot; Mr. Dini said.    &quot;Italian propensity to save and the scope for developing the payments system and providing new services mean that opportunities for intermediaries to make good profits will not be lacking,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
