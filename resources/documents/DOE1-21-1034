Newer techniquesin molecular biology as applied to pathology are discussed and placedin appropriate perspective. All the latest radiological techniques, includingNMR, positrone emission tomography, digital subtraction angiography togetherwith the better established techniques of computerized tomography andconventional radiography are described. The role of interventional radiologyis also elucidated. The Contents discussed are: Techniques for the Determinationof Tumour Neuroendocrine Differentiation and for the Localisation ofIntracellular Organelles Involved in Peptide Synthesis, Storage and Release.New Molecular Techniques in Pathological Diagnosis: Visualisation ofGenes and mRNA in Human Tissue. Statistical Methods of Evaluating andComparing Imaging Techniques. Digital Subtraction Angiography. InterventionalRadiology in Oncology. Computerised Tomography. Magnetic Resonance Imagingin Oncology. Ultrasound Techniques in Oncology. Nuclear Medicine Techniquesin Oncology. Positron Emission Tomography in Oncology. Recent Advancesin Radiotherapy and Oncology and Expectations for the Future.</TEXT></DOC>
