She didn't play it very well,either,'' George Bangs said after he was sentenced in Exeter CrownCourt on Wednesday to two years on probation.   Bangs said his wife's organ playing had destroyed their marriage,and he set fire to their home of 22 years when faced with theprospect of selling it to pay for a divorce. His wife's car also wasdamaged.   The episode hasn't stopped his now-divorced wife's musicalendeavors, Bangs said.   ``She still plays the organ, and so does the man she lives with.They play duets together,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
