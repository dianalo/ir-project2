<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-0824 </DOCNO><TEXT>The proposed action is the issuance of construction permits to the Arizonapublic Service Company for the construction of the Palo Verde NuclearGenerating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3. Preparation of the 3800-acre sitewill involve the clearing of up to 2500 acres of land, 1500 of whichwill be prominently devoted to station facilities. An additional 1200-to 1300-acre evaporation pond will ultimately be developed during thelifetime of the station. About 2200 site acres, previously devoted toagriculture, will be excluded from this land use. Soil disturbance duringconstruction of the station, transmission lines, and water conveyancepipeline will tend to promote erosion and increase siltation in localephemeral water courses. Stringent measures will be taken to minimizethese effects. The total radiation dose to construction workers is estimatedto be 15 man-rem. This dose is a small fraction of the approximately470 man-rem which will be received by the construction force over thesame period from natural background radiation. Station, transmissionline, and water pipeline construction will kill, remove, displace, orotherwise disturb involved flora and fauna, and will eliminate varyingamounts of wildlife breeding, nesting, and forage habitat. These willnot be important permanent impacts to the population stability and structureof the involved local ecosystems of the Sonoran desert; however, measureswill be taken to minimize such effects as do result form the proposedaction.</TEXT></DOC>
