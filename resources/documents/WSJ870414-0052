Palmieri caused a stir in federal court in Manhattan recently just by showing up.    That morning, at least one unidentified figure in Wall Street's insider-trading scandal was rumored to be ready to waive his right to indictment and plead guilty in the court's arraignment section.    But at the last minute, Judge William C. Conner, who had been scheduled to preside over the day's lengthy criminal calendar, was replaced by Judge Palmieri, considered to be one of the court's toughest sentencing judges. When it became clear that Judge Palmieri would be handling the day's pleas, several attorneys and their clients left the courtroom, some muttering that they would return another day.    Whatever the reason, no new insider-trading figures came forward. And four suspects who hadn't been indicted but who had informed the court that they would plead guilty -- including one identified as John Doe and expected to be the insider-trading case -- withdrew their pleas from the docket, in a court where it is unusual for even one such plea to be withdrawn.    Apparently, it was a case of &quot;judge shopping.&quot; In the U.S. district court in Manhattan, unlike other federal courts, only one judge at a time is assigned to accept guilty pleas, and who that judge will be is known months in advance. The same judge who accepts the plea will later hand down the sentence. By picking the right week for a court appearance -- a convenience that the U.S. attorney's office grants to cooperative defendants -- many defense lawyers think they can avoid reputed &quot;tough&quot; judges who lean toward harsher sentences. If a defendant pleads innocent, the trial judge is assigned at random.    The Manhattan court is where Wall Street criminals go to plead guilty, and giving defendants leeway in scheduling their pleas &quot;is kind of a tradition,&quot; says criminal-defense lawyer Thomas Fitzpatrick, a former chief of the U.S. attorney's criminal division here.    To the dismay of some defense lawyers -- and to the relief of judges who find publicity about the system distasteful -- judge shopping may soon be restricted. Later this month, the court will consider changes that would make it more difficult for defendants to manipulate the sentencing procedure.    Under the current system, pleas in the federal court in Manhattan are accepted by a judge in the courthouse's large, first-floor arraignment section, called Part One. Part One was established in 1969 partly to alleviate the court's huge load of cases involving white-collar crime. Insider-trading defendants such as Dennis B. Levine, Martin Siegel, and most of the figures in the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; case entered guilty pleas here. Ivan Boesky also is expected to plead guilty to a criminal count in Part One.    Every two weeks a different one of the court's 36 judges is assigned to hear pleas in Part One. Because prosecutors generally give suspects about six weeks in which they can plead guilty, a defendant gets to choose one of three judges. Defense lawyers often hold off making a plea-agreement with the government until they get in the range of three judges they prefer.    &quot;I'll say to the prosecutor, 'Listen, I'll give you a plea but I want to do a little judge shopping,'&quot; a defense lawyer explains. &quot;You say to him frankly, 'Hey, I'm looking for Judge X, and if he's in Part One, I want him.'&quot;    Defense lawyers expect a mad rush to Part One this Thursday, for example, when Judge Morris E. Lasker will be presiding. Judge Lasker has a reputation for being one of the courthouse's most lenient sentencing judges -- and he is to be followed by Judge Richard Owen, who is said to be one of the harshest.    Judge Lasker declines to comment. Judges Palmieri, Conner and Owen couldn't be reached for comment, but their clerks say the judges almost never comment on their sentencing reputations.    Defense lawyers say judge shopping is helpful to their clients and to the government. They point out that the system gives defendants an incentive to come in and plead guilty, which saves the government time and money by avoiding a trial. Some lawyers say more defendants in complex insider-trading cases would proceed toward a trial if judge shopping were eliminated.    &quot;Some people who should really plead guilty won't do it&quot; if judge shopping isn't allowed, says Edward Brodsky, a defense lawyer and former assistant U.S. attorney here. They would choose to take their chances litigating the cases instead.    Robert G. Morvillo, another former prosecutor now working as a defense attorney, says he doesn't think the number of guilty pleas would change without judge shopping, but he says fewer defendants would agree to cooperate against other suspects. &quot;One of the carrots the government has held out&quot; is giving defendants a choice of judges, he says. Still, Mr. Morvillo scoffs at the notion of ranking judges as lenient or harsh in sentencing. &quot;Many of the so-called harsher judges tend to give you credit for pleading guilty.&quot;    U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani says it has been &quot;no secret at all&quot; that for many years defendants have been given at least six weeks to plead guilty, starting &quot;on the day they decide to plead guilty or when they end their cooperation.&quot; He says the system is a &quot;perfectly reasonable way&quot; to dispose of cases, while putting at least some limits on defense lawyers' ability to shop for judges.    Not all defense lawyers approve of judge shopping. Darrell K. Fennell, a lawyer for one of the defendants in the Yuppie Five case, says judge shopping makes it too easy to plead guilty instead of making a plea decision based on the merits of the case.    Charles L. Brieant, chief judge of Manhattan district court, recently ordered a study of the court's plea procedures. The court's judges are expected to consider that report April 30, and if they vote for a change, white-collar criminals no longer would be able to choose the judges who sentence them. Instead, a sentencing judge could be assigned randomly after a defendant pleads guilty, as is done in assigning a trial judge when a defendant pleads innocent.    Judge Brieant, while declining to speculate about a possible change, says that, in any case, &quot;I'm predicting that whatever the board does there will be no change until after July 1.&quot; The current schedule for judges in Part One runs through June.    Senior Judge Milton Pollack says talk about &quot;judge shopping&quot; in the federal court in Manhattan has been &quot;rather unfortunate&quot; because it has given the mistaken impression that judges are involved some way in accommodating defense lawyers. Although he says changing the procedure is unnecessary, a new system would &quot;remove any suggestion of anyone being in a position to outguess the system.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
