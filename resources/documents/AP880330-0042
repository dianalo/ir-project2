(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential contender MichaelDukakis scored a 2-1 primary victory over Jesse Jackson in thestate next door to his own, while Republicans handed Vice PresidentGeorge Bush an easy victory over Bob Dole, who quit the race beforethe polls closed.   Dukakis backers had been worried about Jackson, who gainedmomentum in his decisive weekend victory over the Massachusettsgovernor in the Michigan caucuses.   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who endorsedDukakis only last week, said there had been ``a lot of anxiousmoments'' in the days before the presidential primary. But, hesaid: ``We've stemmed the tide.''   The Massachusetts governor got the lift from his neighbors hehad counted on Tuesday, besting Jackson 58 percent to 28 percent,according to final unofficial returns. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee lagged with 8 percent.   ``This sends us back to Wisconsin and Colorado with a very goodboost,'' Dukakis said, looking ahead to next week's contests.   Speaking by a telephone link to Connecticut supporters inHartford, Dukakis said it had been ``a wonderful night and awonderful victory.''   ``You're good neighbors and good friends,'' he said.   Dukakis walked away with 36 of the 52 Connecticut delegates upfor grabs, and Jackson took 16.   In the GOP race, Bush had 70 percent of the vote in the statewhere he grew up, to Dole's 20 percent, according to unofficialfinal returns. Bush took 25 of the 35 delegates at stake, whileDole got the other 10.   A poll released last week, before the Michigan caucuses,indicated Dukakis was favored by 50 percent of Democrats to 16percent for Jackson, while 27 percent were undecided.   Jackson had strong showings in Connecticut's cities and exitpolling by WNBC-TV in New York showed Jackson winning the votes ofone of every five white Connecticut Democrats.   Four years ago, by comparison, Jackson got 5 percent of thewhite vote. Former Hartford Mayor Thirman L. Milner, Jackson'sConnecticut chairman, said in 1984, Jackson was seen only as ``ablack voter's candidate.''   ``That is no longer the case,'' Milner said. ``He is getting across-section of Connecticut voters. I think his campaign is righton target.''   After the GOP returns were in, Bush called for ``a good unifiedeffort for the fall.''   Bush turned his attention to the general election before theprimary results were in, since Dole dropped out while Connecticutpolls were still open.   ``The job you all did in Connecticut got through to myopponents,'' Bush said by telephone from Wisconsin to about 200supporters at a Wallingford victory celebration.   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, who ignoredConnecticut, said Tuesday he couldn't dispute Bush's lock on thenomination.   Unofficial final returns showed Dukakis with 139,968 votes,Jackson with 68,193 and Gore with 18,542 votes.   In addition, former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 5,767 votes, or2 percent; Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois had 3,136 votes, or 1percent; former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt had 2,512 votes, or 1percent; Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri had 1,018 votes, or 1percent.   Hart, Babbitt, and Gephardt have all left the Democraticpresidential race. Gephardt was the most recent dropout, abandoninghis bid on Monday.   One percent, or 1,924 voters, chose the uncommitted line.   The unofficial reurns showed Bush with 73,020 votes; Dole with21,032; Robertson with 3,415, or 3 percent; and Rep. Jack Kemp ofNew York with 3,375 votes, or 3 percent; and another 1 percent, or3,200, uncommitted.   Kemp dropped out of the GOP race earlier this month.</TEXT></DOC>
