WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From Tahitian tree snails to Arabian antelopes,international wildlife conservationists say they are succeeding insaving some of the world's endangered species.   About 200 specialists of the World Conservation Union's SpeciesSurvival Commission met in Rome this week to discuss ways ofprotecting animals threatened by poaching, destruction of habitatand encroachment by man.   The union, based in Gland, Switzerland, groups governments,government agencies and non-governmental organizations such as theSierra Club.   The three-day Rome meeting, which ended Tuesday, examined thewell-known plight of the African elephant, whose numbers havedropped from 1.3 million to 700,000 in the past 10 years because ofpoaching.   But the experts also discussed the prospects for savinglesser-known species such as the Mediterranean monk seal, Himalayansnow leopard, Florida panther, Javan rhinoceros and Liberianmongoose.   In many cases, the answer is breeding animals in captivity andreleasing them in the wild.   ``It's only in the past few years that captive breeding hasbecome an integral part of conservation,'' said Ulysses S. Seal, aprofessor at the University of Minnesota who is chairman of theunion's captive breeding group. ``We project that 1,500 animals,birds and reptiles will need captive breeding in the next 50 years.Right now, we have more than 125 species on our plate.''   Those include the Arabian oryx, a large antelope that becameextinct in the wild but was saved by breeding in zoos in London,Phoenix and elsewhere. Wild herds now roam Oman, Jordan and SaudiArabia.   ``This is the flagship example of a dramatic species saved fromextinction by captive breeding,'' Seal said in an interview.   Another success story involves the black-footed ferret, a memberof the Wyoming weasel family. Only 17 were left in the wild in 1985,but captive breeding has brought the population up to 124.   ``We predict that in two years the population will expand to morethan 500, and in 1991 we plan to start releasing them back into thewild,'' Seal said.   He also cited efforts to save the partula, a species of tiny treesnails found on the Tahitian island of Moorea. The species wasvirtually wiped out by carniverous snails imported from Florida, butthe surviving partula have been taken to a dozen zoos in fourcountries for breeding, Seal said.   The next target is the Javan rhino. The lumbering beasts onceroamed across much of Indochina but today only 50 are left on theisland of Java. Seal said the union is working with the Indonesiangovernment to begin a captive breeding program next year.   Captive breeding is not the answer for all animals, however,especially members of the cat species.   ``There is some captive breeding, but there are a lot of problemsin reintroducing a large predator that is captive bred,'' said PeterJackson, chairman of the conservation union's cat specialist group.``For one thing, people are afraid of them. Also, a cat has to learnhow to hunt from its parents, it doesn't come naturally.''   Nevertheless, conservationists have succeeded in saving the thelynx, which was extinct in western Europe at the turn of thecentury. More than a dozen were caught in the wild in Czechoslovakiaand released in the Swiss and French Alps in the early 1970s. Sixtyto 80 lynx survive in the wild today, Jackson said.   Conservation has taken a unique twist in India, where man-eatingtigers have killed more than 500 people in the Sunderbans mangoveforests of West Bengal since 1975.   It seems that tigers only attack their prey from behind. So threeyears ago, wildlife officials began issuing rubber face masks forSunderbans workers to wear on the backs of their heads.   Since then, no one wearing a mask has been attacked, Jackson said.   ``Some were attacked after they had just taken off the mask forlunch,'' he said. ``Tigers have been seen following those wearingthe masks but they have not pressed home the attack.''   For all the attention devoted to tigers, elephants, rhinos andothers animals, it is some of the world's smaller species that aremost at risk, specialists said.   ``People focus on the larger species that they are going tomiss,'' said George Rabb, president of the Chicago Zoological Parkand chairman of the species survival commission. ``But for every oneof these, at least 5,000 species disappear every year, mainly smallinsects living in rain forests.''   ``You could almost bet that the most endangered species in theworld is not known to science,'' added Martin Holdgate, directorgeneral of the union. ``It is living somewhere in the canopy of arain forest. One of these unknown, inconspicuous insects. Noscientist will miss it, except as a statistic.''</TEXT></DOC>
