The latest deliberations indicate that Pentagon and WhiteHouse officials, who for months dismissed the idea ofproposing sizable defense cuts starting next year, are nowincreasingly focusing on that strategy as a possible way topre-empt Congress from seeking deeper reductions.</LP><TEXT>   The debate now under way at the highest levels of theadministration also shows that the nation's top generals andadmirals are willing to sacrifice some of their most prizedweaponry for the 21st century in order to retain a larger andbetter-trained force in the next few years.   Officials involved in the deliberations stressed thatDefense Secretary Dick Cheney and White House aides haven'tmade any final decisions, and proposed spending levels formajor programs won't be decided until the end of the month.Even if cuts of $50 billion or more through the late 1990sare approved, these officials said, details of where the axwill fall in later years won't be worked out until well aftersubmission early next year of the fiscal 1993 budget.   The list of potential targets, drawn up by the JointChiefs of Staff and civilian budget officials, ranges fromhalting development of the Army's next-generation tank toreducing purchases of the Air Force's newest cargo planes andhigh-performance fighters. Such cutbacks in research andhardware would yield about $5 billion in savings for thefirst year, according to most estimates.   That may be too little for Congress during the comingelection year. Congress already has ordered a 25% reductionin the number of active-duty military personnel by 1996, afar deeper reduction than the Pentagon originally proposed.And lawmakers are expected to balk at many of the trade-offsreflected in the latest budget numbers under review by Mr.Cheney.   The administration will propose leaving some categories ofdefense spending largely untouched next year. Mr. Bush stillis expected to request more than $60 billion for the Navy andat least that much to train, equip and support active-dutyArmy divisions world-wide. Air Force surveillance, space andspecial operations also are among the few areas expected toavoid major budget cuts.   But the proposed long-term spending blueprints drafted bythe Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to military planners andcongressional aides, would eliminate more than $50 billionpreviously earmarked to develop and field the F-22 AdvancedTactical Fighter, a fleet of super-quiet Seawolf attacksubmarines, a long-range &quot;stealthy&quot; bomber for carrier decksand several other expensive weapons.   The Army would suspend development of its so-called Block3 tank, possibly saving nearly $2 billion over the next threeyears, according to officials. Stretching out and reducingeventual Air Force purchases of F-22s, C-17 cargo planes andB-2 Stealth bombers, as some internal Pentagon documentspropose, could reduce projected defense spending by more than$20 billion through 1997.   In addition, both Defense and Energy Department officialsconfirmed yesterday that they are actively consideringhalting production of new warheads for the Trident IImissile, one of the mainstays of the U.S. nuclear submarinefleet. If they do so, remaining Trident IIs would be armedwith less powerful, 1970s-vintage warheads. And the EnergyDepartment would halt all production at its troubled RockyFlats weapons complex in Colorado.   Officials said the Pentagon's &quot;worst case&quot; contingencyplans through 1997 would call for reducing active-duty Armypersonnel by nearly 100,000 in addition to the almost200,000-person cut currently envisioned. They would phase outabout 350 Air Force front-line fighters in addition to theroughly 700 currently scheduled to go. Aircraft-carrieroverhauls also would be postponed, and the Navy's activefleet would shrink to less than 350 vessels by the end of thedecade from nearly 550 today.   Not even the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposedmissile-defense system at the very top of Mr. Bush's defensepriorities, has managed to avoid the current round ofPentagon cutbacks. SDI chief Henry Cooper, for example, toldreporters earlier this week that schedule and budgetpressures forced him to abandon the idea of using space-basedsensors to help guide ground-based missiles as part of theinitial deployment concept. Mr. Cooper also acknowledged thatcutbacks in the Defense Department's long-range spending plancould make it impossible to comply with congressionaldirectives to have the first anti-missile batteries fullyoperational as early as 1996.</TEXT></DOC>
