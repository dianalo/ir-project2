The pact doesn't appear to have any bearing on themounting prospects that rail unions will strike the nation'sfreight railroads after 12:01 a.m. next Wednesday when acooling-off period expires.</LP><TEXT>   CSX said two earlier agreements, identical to the oneapproved this week, had failed ratification. The agreementthat was approved calls for the size of crews to be reducedto three from four.   One analyst estimated that the agreement could lead toelimination of 375 positions, resulting in an annual pretaxsavings to CSX of between $10 million and $15 million. Thecompany declined to specify potential savings from theagreement.   Under the pact, employees who are no longer needed forreduced crew-size operations can sign up for a voluntaryseparation allowance of between $30,000 and $50,000 or accepttransfer to other locations where additional employees areneeded.   CSX, a railroad, ocean container and barge company, saidimplementation of the agreement will complete a two-and-ahalfyear effort to reduce the size of all CSX crews to threeemployees from four. Including the latest agreement, some1,400 train-service employees will have left active serviceas a result of crew-size agreements since 1988. CSX took aspecial pretax charge in the second quarter of 1988 thatincluded $592 million for rail labor separations.   John W.
