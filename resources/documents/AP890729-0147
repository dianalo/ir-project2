Like the hardware store, the gas station, the grocery and somany others in so many towns in so many parts of rural America, theSilver Spur soon failed, and Brzezinski figured Roby wasn't farbehind.   But today, an unusual economic development plan has begun tobreathe new life into this one-stoplight town. A new retirementcenter has opened, and because of aggressive promotion, coveys ofquail hunters now flock to Fisher County.   Even the Silver Spur is going to shine again. Brzezinski isrenovating the cafe and bringing it back from the dead this fall,convinced that the hungry hunters who come from 26 states for thefour-month season will help the town of 814, and its onlyrestaurant, survive.   ``Our attitude has changed,'' he said. ``This is what hasinspired me to do it again.''   What's happening in Fisher County is held up across remote areasas an innovative approach to saving dying towns. Yet even here,after a handful of small successes, the future remains mostlybleak, and experts say the situation underscores just how difficultit is to revitalize rural America.   ``We have slowed the departure rate but, honestly, we haven'tstopped it or reversed it,'' said David Morris, chairman of thecounty's economic development commission. ``All this is for naughtunless we find the key to repopulating rural America.''   Three years ago, Fisher County's leaders declared a crisis: Ifthey didn't do something, the county would die. Typical of smallrural towns across the country, the population had already declined44 percent over 10 years to just 5,000. Storefronts were boardedup. People, especially the young, moved to the cities.   ``We were kind of desperate _ no doubt about it,'' said RichardSpencer, the county agriculture extension agent who broughttogether the local leaders.   They rounded up state and national experts on economicdevelopment and sought their advice.   They created the Fisher County Economic Development Commission,and they made one key decision: Go for all the little projects theycould think of, not one big project.   ``Everyone thinks that General Motors is going to come drop afactory in here or the B-2 (stealth bomber) program will drop inhere. That doesn't happen, and that's the common mistake ruralpeople make,'' said Morris, a specialist on developing Third Worldnations who retired to run a motel here.   The result has become a creative, if unconventional, model forrural economic development.   ``They have less money and resources to work with, and yet after10 years of decline, now they've got new money coming in,'' saidDavid Guarino of the Texas Department of Agriculture, which hasprovided a grant for the quail hunting effort. ``If they can do it,you can do it all over.''   The commission has set out to revive this depressed cattle,cotton and oil area by promoting it as a retirement spot, drawingtourists and finding ways to keep citizens from leaving.   Two commission members bought an abandoned nursing home andhelped find new owners who have refurbished it. It's now thecounty's only retirement center _ even though 60 percent of thepopulation is over age 55.   Realizing Fisher County had Texas' largest quail population, thecommission formed a quail-hunting cooperative, which in its firstyear brought in 140 hunters and an estimated $100,000 of newspending.   ``One hundred thousand dollars is an attention-getter in thistown,'' said Billy Don Atkinson, a Roby-based federal agricultureofficial who helps run the co-op.   And in Fisher County, they'll try anything.   The commission is hoping to build a memorial garden for slainpolice officers and turn an abandoned electric train depot into amuseum to draw tourists. They're trying to raise money and servethe large poverty-level population with a food bank andused-clothing store. They've helped open a recreational vehiclepark.   The group even formed the National Domino Association and playedhost to a first-ever national tournament.   Not all of the ideas are working.   The domino idea, while fun, hasn't produced much money and willprobably be cut back. The law enforcement monument has drawn a15-acre land donation, but has only $400 in the bank.   ``Time is short; doom is just around the corner,'' said the Rev.Alvin Petty, the leader of the commission's tourism task force.``We've only got three or four more years to achieve a great dealbecause we're losing 8 percent of our population a year.''   Commission officials say they now know that their small-scaleendeavors are simply setting the stage for necessary largerdevelopment. ``We have prepared the table, but we haven't gotten tothe meat and potatoes,'' Morris said.   And help will have to come from Washington, he believes, in theform of a modern Homestead Act that would once again encouragepeople to return to rural areas.   ``Until we get that kind of public policy, the rest of this isMickey Mouse. If they don't put that structure in place, all ofrural America will be blowing in the wind.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Scott McCartney is the AP Southwest regionalreporter, based in Dallas.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
