Gorbachevon Thursday declared his first state visit to West Germany hadyielded ``a convergence of souls'' that stirred hopes for a new ageof trust and cooperation in Europe.   But while his four-day summit was drenched in an atmosphere ofgoodwill, Gorbachev gave no ground on the emotional issue of areunited Germany _ the issue of biggest concern to West Germans.   At a news conference capping his appearances in Bonn, Gorbachevdismissed the Berlin Wall as ``no great problem,'' compared withother East-West differences, and sidestepped questions about thechances for reunification.   Those issues are of utmost importance to West Germans andGorbachev's failure to tackle them could allow the aura of goodwillto slip.   Gorbachev enjoys more popularity among West Germans than anyother foreign statesman, according to opinion polls, and most ofthat support is rooted in a hope that his reforms will some day leadto reunification with Moscow-aligned East Germany.   When the Kremlin leader was asked whether he thought Europe wouldever again recognize a single German state, he gave a vague andtraditional reply.   ``The situation in Europe today was determined by historicalrealities,'' Gorbachev answered, referring to World War II.   He dismissed suggestions the Berlin Wall stands as a symbol ofthe Cold War and a time of less promise in relations between Eastand West.   ``I don't think the Berlin Wall is the sole barrier between Eastand West,'' Gorbachev said at the news conference.   Soviet dissident and Nobel Peace laureate Andrei Sakharov said inAmsterdam he hoped the Berlin Wall would be torn down soon and askedthe communist world to ``liberate (itself) from the lies of thepast.''   Sakharov, in the Netherlands to pick up an honorary law degree,commented on Gorbachev's remarks that the Wall was ``no greatproblem ... nothing is eternal in this world.''   ``It is a very good statement,'' he said. ``I hope it will happensoon, but it would of course have been best if it would never havebeen built in the first place.''   The Soviet news agency Tass later reported Gorbachev's returnhome.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher will giveU.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III a report on the Gorbachevvisit in Washington next week, State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said.   East Germany built the wall in 1961 to halt a tide of emigration,and Gorbachev echoed the Berlin government claim that it ``tookadvantage of its sovereign rights'' to build the wall, and that itsremoval depended on an end to the conditions that led to itsconstruction.   Gorbachev suggested the wall should not be given too muchsignificance in East-West relations, noting it was one of a numberof differences.   ``I see this as no great problem,'' he concluded.   Reflecting West Germans' eagerness to see the Soviet visit in themost positive light, Bonn government spokesman Hans Klein said hesaw Gorbachev's response as containing rays of hope.   ``The Soviet general secretary said this is something that can beovercome, something that can be solved,'' Klein said later.   Gorbachev told steelworkers in the industrial city of Dortmund inthe Ruhr Valley that, ``What we've encountered here on your soilmoved us a lot.''   ``We saw many faces, we looked many people in the eyes, we feltmuch sympathy, I would say a convergence of souls,'' he said.   Both Soviet and West German officials appeared to take specialcare throughout the summit to avoid controversy.   A joint declaration of goals for Europe, which Gorbachevdescribed as the most momentous accomplishment of his summit,reiterated arms control objectives on which both the Warsaw Pact andNATO have similar approaches. Yet it omitted any mention ofshort-range nuclear weapons, over which the two blocs disagree.   Despite the lack of movement on issues close to West Germans, theimage of successful East-West diplomacy could offer politicalrewards for both leaders.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party has lostbadly in recent elections, and Gorbachev continues to facewidespread resistance to his reforms.   Both Soviets and West Germans suffer some insecurity about theirstanding in world affairs, and the outpouring of good feeling thepast four days has boosted their sense of confidence.   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker said Gorbachev'svisit had formed a bond between the peoples of the Soviet Union andWest Germany.   ``If you think of all the suffering and also the fear, it's areal human and political advance,'' Weizsaecker said. ``Theattraction and also trust have grown.''   At his news conference, Gorbachev also said his leadershipregretted some aspects of the conflict in China and expressedconcern over the future of reforms there. It was his most extensivecomment on China since pro-democracy demonstrations heated up duringhis visit to Beijing a month ago.</TEXT></DOC>
