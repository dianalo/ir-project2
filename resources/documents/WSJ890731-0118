He tried hiring more salesmen to push his radio products, but they took too much time to learn the ropes. He tried changing the product design, but that cost a lot. One solution, he decided, was to beef up advertising.    Lucky for Mr. Wenninger, who was then president of Allied Signal Inc.'s Bendix/King division, all this trial and error was carried out in the safety and privacy of his own computer. He won't disclose Bendix/King's ultimate strategy, but he says using computer simulation was like gaining &quot;the luxury of 20 years of experience&quot; in a week. Mr. Wenninger praises the software, saying it &quot;is just the dog's woof.&quot;    Business simulation has been around corporate computer rooms and graduate-school labs for years. But it is only recently that powerful personal computers and simpler software have brought the technology to average managers, giving them something akin to the airline pilot's experience in flight simulation. The idea is to let managers launch experiments, test strategies, even fail -- without suffering the consequences.    Some computer experts are skeptical that simulation will ever be a standard management tool. But inventors and users have high hopes that the machines can teach managers to do what they're always being exhorted to do: think about the long term, and care about more than their immediate turf.    &quot;We sit managers down at the computer and try to make them look at the big picture,&quot; says Chris Charyk, who uses simulation software as an internal consultant at Digital Equipment Corp.    In the normal business day, of course, there's not much time for that. Typical managers rush to decisions, at best weighing a few options and looking ahead a couple of months. At worst, they live from crisis to crisis.    &quot;If you're up to your butt in alligators, {it's too late} to think about draining the swamp,&quot; says a marketing executive for a consumer products company. He cites his own product managers, who routinely &quot;assuage short-term pain&quot; by cutting prices to make sales, only to see retail inventories mount and volume drop a few months later. He is working on a simulation for his employees, he says, hoping to let them &quot;live through the situation and see what happens if you did a little drainage.&quot;    Bruce Carbone, a process control engineer at General Electric Co.'s turbine division, got a similar message in a recent project leadership simulation conducted by Planning andamp; Control Inc., a New York-based training firm.    The PCI software pushed teams of GE employees to finish a project within a certain budget and deadline, Mr. Carbone says. His team's inclination was to &quot;throw people&quot; at the project, figuring that more bodies would get it done sooner. But the simulation showed that, in staffing, less is more: The extra workers in the simulation took longer to learn the job, and more people meant that there were more communication foul-ups.    When that happens in a real plant or office, says GE project manager Paula Wright, managers just rationalize it or &quot;say, 'Well, they must be the wrong people,' so you change people.&quot; Mr. Carbone says that making the mistake with the computer has made him think twice before doing the same in real life.    Real life is what simulations try to replicate. A spreadsheet, probably the most common manager's software tool, presents static, numerical calculations and is basically a time saver. A simulation should be more like getting into a good novel or movie, says Barry Richmond, president of High Performance Systems Inc., a software firm in Lyme, N.H. &quot;If it's powerful, you lose your sense of time, you are transported.&quot; So simulations try to reproduce not only the numbers of business but also the human frailties and unexpected events that complicate working life.    PCI training simulations include workplace &quot;personalities,&quot; from a workaholic who feels she doesn't get enough credit to an ornery veteran who doesn't want to work so hard anymore. And just as teams of managers think they have pinned down a workable strategy, the software flashes &quot;news bulletins&quot;: &quot;Had an accident -- lost time 12 hours]&quot; or &quot;Vendor A announces 4% price increase]&quot;    Many simulation tools, like those created by PCI, are used only in training. But some companies are beginning to market software designed for day-to-day use by the individual manager at his desk. One such tool is Stella, created by High Performance for Apple computers, and designed to allow users to build into it their own scenarios, using graphic displays and other visual aids.    With Stella, the screen shows a sort of animated plumbing system, where users can fill little buckets with cash, inventory and even frustration, and can send spending, hiring, sales and even buildup of confidence flowing through small pipes. Lightbulbs flash warnings such as &quot;Cost]&quot;    Even if a manager doesn't have exact figures to plug in, Mr. Wenninger says, he can use the computer's hand-held pointer to draw onto the screen &quot;what's in the mind's eye.&quot;    Advocates say that the power of simulation lies in its immediate feedback. &quot;It's the old Pavlovian thing,&quot; says Donna Wilson, a partner in Mader Group, which does simulation training. Normally, she says, business people make decisions in the first quarter that they &quot;don't get feedback on until next year&quot; -- if then.    &quot;If you're being {rated} on producing sales in this quarter,&quot; says Digital's Mr. Charyk, &quot;the whole idea of manufacturing and production isn't your responsibility. It's someone else's.&quot; Simulation, he says, can give sales managers a graphic feel for what happens in a distant plant or warehouse weeks or months after the sales department decides to offer a discount allowance or attend another trade show.    To do this, a simulation piles on as many variables as possible, pushing users to see beyond simple cause and effect. Without that look at what's further down the road, &quot;the things we can measure {immediately} are the things we focus on,&quot; says Bob Bergin, a property claims manager who has helped develop simulation training for colleagues at Hanover Insurance Corp. In real life, he says, a claims manager who skimps on the claims process and gets through lots of business quickly with few employees might look like &quot;a hero&quot; and get a promotion.    Simulation shows that this strategy could obscure less salutary side effects, like higher payments made on claims that aren't adequately investigated. Hanover spent about 18 months developing a detailed simulation and has trained over 100 managers on it so far.    That kind of investment is what gives pause to some computer experts. Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative Strategies International, a high-technology market-research firm, says such customization of the software takes too much time and money to justify in many situations. And he thinks the technology is going to appeal only to &quot;managers with a lot of faith in computer process.&quot;    Chris Meyers, a consultant in San Francisco, is also cautious. A simulation tool like Stella &quot;might look less complex than the spread sheet,&quot; he says, &quot;but it clearly boggles the average mind.&quot; He shows clients the results of his simulation experiments, not the process.    Still, he considers his experiments enlightening. &quot;We're used to using models to predict what will happen,&quot; says Mr. Meyer. &quot;Stella is for understanding how things happen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
