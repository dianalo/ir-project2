REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Corazon Aquino's responseto Ferdinand Marcos' latest health crisis belies her claims of astable government and shows the nervousness with which she stillviews her ousted predecessor.   Mrs. Aquino said today her government is not strong enough torisk the return of Marcos and that even his funeral could causetrouble.   She refused on Friday to allow the ailing, 71-year-old deposedpresident to return from Hawaiian exile and die in his homeland.She also refused to allow him to be buried here.   But her national security adviser and a senator closelyidentified with the administration indicated today the governmentmight allow a Marcos burial if his followers guarantee there wouldbe no bid to undermine the government.   Mrs. Aquino's caution is well-founded, considering Marcossupporters led some of the six coup attempts wthat rocked her firsttwo years in power.   But since a bloody August 1987 attempt, the government hasboasted continually of its stability, pointing to two years ofeconomic growth rates above 5 percent and numerous surveys showingMrs. Aquino's popularity.   Government and military spokesmen claim communist rebels arelosing strength and Marcos' following has been reduced to a fewthousand fanatics.   ``Marcos is no longer viewed by many Filipinos as a threat tothe Aquino government,'' wrote Aquino critic Ninez Cacho-Olivaresin the Filipino publication BusinessWorld. ``Few believe that he orhis wife is capable of making a political comeback.''   Few challenge Mrs. Aquino's decision to prevent Marcos comingback alive.   But in a society that tends to forget its leaders' pastindiscretions, preventing a former president from being buried inhis homeland has struck many as short-sighted and vindictive.   ``One would hate to think too that Mrs. Aquino would be sostubbornly uncharitable as to turn down a dying man's last requesteven if, as she probably believes, the man was the single biggestcause of her widowhood,'' said the newspaper Malaya, which stronglyopposed Marcos.   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain at Manilaairport in 1983 moments after returning from the United States tochallenge Marcos.   After a Cabinet meeting to discuss the affair today, Mrs. Aquinotold reporters she feared Marcos' followers would exploit the deathof the man who ruled longer than any Philippine president much asher own supporters used her husband's murder for political gain.   ``Let's say a person has been ill for 20 years and now, afterthree years, he is slowly recovering,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``Justbecause he is growing stronger does not mean you are going toexpose him to infection.''   Commentator Luis Beltran wrote in The Manila Standard: ``It is ano-win situation for President Aquino and her government. If shekeeps to her frequent statements that her government is stable andbeyond the reach of coups d'etat, she has no choice but to allowMarcos and his family to come home.''   National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto told reporters todaythere was a chance the government might reconsider a Marcos burial.   ``I don't think that issue of forever refusing him is valid,''Ileto said. ``It could change.''   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel said the government might allow a burialin Marcos' Ilocos Norte home province if the family pledged ``thatthey will not use his remains as political capital, like paradinghim around Manila.''   Marcos evokes deep and often contradictory emotions in an Asiansociety that respects authority but harbors bitter memories ofeight years of martial rule.   On Friday, amid reports Marcos might die at any time, newsorganizations were flooded with calls from bankers, officials andordinary Filipinos asking if he was dead.   Government officials have said privately the administrationcould face the specter of counter-demonstrations by bothanti-Marcos leftists and pro-Marcos rightists if his body werereturned.   That would encourage opposition from the left and right anddiscourage foreign investors.   Already, questions have been raised about the stability of theAquino administration in the wake of the April 21 assassinationhere of U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe by communist rebels.   As a sign of uncertainty, share prices dropped 18 points Fridaybecause of the rumor Marcos already had died. Business sources saidbanks were quietly buying up dollars for fear Marcos' death wouldtrigger unrest and depress the Philippine peso.   Selling stocks and buying dollars was a ``normal response'' to alooming political crisis, one analyst said on condition ofanonymity.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Robert Reid has been Associated Press chief ofbureau in Manila since 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
