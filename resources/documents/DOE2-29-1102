Papers are organised into 5 sections whichinclude the following topics: analysis of pollutants; chemical and photochemicalreactions; mechanisms and rates; aerosol characterization and particleformation; pollutant cycles; transport and modelling. From these papers,it is clear that the aspects related to the physico-chemistry of aciddeposition and formation of photochemical oxidants in the tropospherehave received particular attention.</TEXT></DOC>
