This notice discusses the proposed revisionsand EPA's rationale for proposing to approve them. The notice is dividedinto six separate sections for clarity. Section I discusses the revisionsto Connecticut's new source review (NSR) regulations including the State'snewly adopted regulations for the prevention of significant deterioration(PSD). Section II discusses the revisions to Connecticut's stack heightand dispersion techniques regulations. Section III discusses revisionsto Connecticut's regulations which satisfy the PSD-related requirementsfor PM<T2>10</T2>. Section IV discusses nonregulatory revisions to Connecticut's<T3>Ambient Impact Analysis Guideline</T3>. Section V discusses miscellaneousminor revisions to certain Connecticut SIP regulations to ensure that theyremain consistent with their original intent as approved by EPA. Finally,Section VI discusses revisions which satisfy the CEM requirements for Stateplans.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. New Source Review Revisions</ITAG>A. BackgroundIn 1979 and 1980, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protectionadopted NSR regulations for permitting new and modified sources in nonattainmentareas to satisfy the requirements of Part D of Clean Air Act and 40 CFR51.160 through 51.165. EPA conditionally approved these regulations onDecember 23, 1980. Pursuant to corrective actions taken by the State ofConnecticut, EPA removed the conditions of its approval of these regulationson January 7, 1982. On June 19, 1978, EPA promulgated the PSD regulations of 40 CFR 52.21(b)through (v) into the Connecticut SIP at 40 CFR 52.382 and federally implementedthe PSD program in Connecticut. On August 7, 1980, EPA revised these regulationspursuant to a court decision. (<T3>Alabama Power Company et al. </T3>v. <T3>Costle </T3>D.C. Cir. No. 78-1006 December 14, 1979). On July 14, 1982,the Connecticut DEP requested a partial delegation of authority to implementthe PSD regulations of 40 CFR 52.21. On September 29, 1982 EPA approvedthis partial delegation, and the Connecticut DEP began issuing PSD permits.On December 27, 1988, the Connecticut DEP adopted revisions to its newsource review regulations to make them consistent with the current requirementsof Part D of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 51.160 through 51.165. Theserevisions to Connecticut's NSR rules also include newly adopted PSD regulationsto satisfy part C of the Clean Air Act and the requirements of 40 CFR Part51.166 for SIPs. Once Connecticut's PSD regulations are approved by EPA,the State will have <T3>full </T3>authority to implement and enforce the PSD program throughits SIP, the federal implemented PSD Plan (FIP) at 40 CFR 52.382 will beremoved, and the delegation agreement between EPA and the Connecticut DEPshall be terminated. B. Summary of Connecticut's Submittal On January 20, 1989, the Connecticut DEP submitted new and amended regulationsto EPA as revisions to its SIP. The revisions include changes to section22a-174-1, ``Definitions,'' and section 22a-174-3, ``Permits to Constructand Permits to Operate Stationary Sources of Modifications,'' of Connecticut'sregulations. In addition, the revisions include an updated version of Connecticut'snonregulatory SIP narrative entitled, ``New Source Review,'' which explainsthe process the Connecticut DEP follows in the review of new or modifiedstationary sources in accordance with its regulations. These revisions also include a letter from the Connecticut DEP that certifiesthat the Connecticut DEP is implementing the ``Top Down'' approach in determiningBest Available Control Technology (BACT) in accordance with EPA's December1987 memorandum from Craig Potter entitled, ``Improving New Source ReviewImplementation'' and in accordance with the BACT document issued by theNortheast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) dated October,1988. In addition, the Connecticut DEP committed to using the ``Top Down''approach in all future BACT determinations. EPA has evaluated these proposed revisions and found that they are equivalentto or in some instances, more stringent than, the requirements of 40 CFR51.160 through 51.166 with the exception of the provisions discussed below.Connecticut's regulations for NSR/PSD, and EPA's evaluation are detailedin a memorandum dated May 3, 1989 entitled, ``Technical Support Document_ConnecticutNew Source Review Revisions.'' Copies of that document are available, uponrequest, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> Section of this notice.C. Amendments to Connecticut's NSR/PSD Regulations Necessary for FinalApprovalSection 22a-174-1 of Connecticut's regulations does not include a definitionof the term, ``Begin Actual Construction.'' In order for EPA to take finalaction to approve these revisions, Connecticut must include the definitionof this term found at 40 CFR 51.166(b)(11).Subdivision 22a-174-3(k)(7) of Connecticut's regulations does not includeall of the PSD monitoring provisions. In order for EPA to take final actionto approve these revisions, Connecticut must amend subdivision 22a-174-3(k)(7)to make it consistent with 40 CFR 51.166(m).Connecticut must commit to adhere to EPA's ``Recommended Policy on theControl of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)'' (42 FR 31314, July 8, 1977).The State cannot allow reductions in VOCs from existing sources to be usedto offset increases of more reactive VOCs when implementing its NSR regulations.Final action by EPA to approve these revisions is contingent upon Connecticut'scommitment to adhere to this policy.D. Today's Action<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Connecticut's request to revise section 22a-174-1,``Definitions,'' and section 22a-174-3, ``Permits to Construct and Permitsto Operate Stationary Sources or Modifications,'' of the<T3> Regulations of Connecticut Department of Environmental ProtectionConcerning the Abatement of Air Pollution.</T3> EPA is also proposing toapprove changes to Connecticut's SIP narrative entitled, ``New Source Review.''These revisions satisfy the current federal NSR and PSD requirements of40 CFR 51.160 through 51.166. EPA is proposing approval with the understandingthat the Connecticut DEP will make the necessary additions and revisionsto its regulations and the commitment to adhere to EPA's ``RecommendedPolicy on the Control of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC),'' as outlinedin this notice, prior to final EPA approval of these revisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Stack Height Revisions</ITAG>A. BackgroundOn February 8, 1982 (47 FR 5864), EPA promulgated final regulations limitingstack height credits and other dispersion techniques as required by section123 of the Act. These regulations were challenged in the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the D.C. Circuit by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc.,the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvaniain<T3> Sierra Club</T3> v.<T3> EPA,</T3> 710 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1983). On October 11, 1983, thecourt issued its decision ordering EPA to reconsider portions of the stackheight regulations, reversing certain portions and upholding other portions.On February 28, 1984, the electric power industry filed a petition fora writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On July 2, 1984, theSupreme Court denied the petition, 104 S.Ct. 3571 (1984), and on July 18,1984, the Court of Appeals' mandate was formally issued, implementing thecourt's decision and requiring EPA to promulgate revisions to the stackheight regulations within six months. The promulgation deadline was ultimatelyextended to June 27, 1985. Revisions to the stack height regulations wereproposed on November 9, 1984 (49 FR 344878) and finalized on July 8, 1985(50 FR 27892).The revisions redefine a number of specific terms including ``excessiveconcentrations,'' ``dispersion techniques,'' ``nearby,'' and other importantconcepts, and modified some of the bases for determining good engineeringpractice (GEP) stack height.Pursuant to section 406(d)(2)(B) of the Act, all states were required to(1) review and revise, as necessary, their SIPs to include provisions thatlimit stack height credits and dispersion techniques in accordance withthe revised regulations; and (2) review all existing emission limitationsto determine whether any of these limitations have been affected by stackheight credits above GEP or any other dispersion techniques. For any limitationsso effected, states were to prepare revised limitations consistent withtheir revised SIPs. All SIP revisions and revised emission limits wereto be submitted to EPA, as required by section 406. Subsequently, EPA issueddetailed guidance on the performance of the required reviews.On January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a decision in<T3> NRDC</T3> v.<T3> Thomas,</T3> 838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. CIR. 1988), regarding EPA's revisedJuly 8, 1985 stack height regulations. Subsequent petitions for rehearingwere denied. The Court remanded three provisions to EPA that may potentiallybear on state actions now being taken pursuant to EPA's July 8, 1985 regulations.However, since EPA is currently in the process of reconsidering the remandedprovisions and the outcome is as yet unknown, our review of Connecticut'sJanuary 20, 1989 submittal addresses its consistency with the July 8, 1985regulations only. If EPA further revises its regulations in response tothe remand at some future date, Connecticut will, at that time, be requiredto revise its regulations accordingly. Sources may have to have their permitsamended and/or be required to submit new demonstrations that applicableambient standards are met if affected by such revisions.B. Summary of Connecticut's SubmittalConnecticut's January 20, 1989, SIP submittal includes revisions to section22a-174-1, ``Definitions,'' and section 22a-174-3, ``Permits to Constructand Permits to Operate Stationary Sources or Modifications,'' of Connecticut'sregulations which limit stack height credits and dispersion techniques.These revisions are adequate and meet the current requirements in 40 CFR51.100 and 51.118.EPA's evaluation of Connecticut's stack height and dispersion techniquesrequirements is detailed in a memorandum entitled, ``Technical SupportDocument_Connecticut's Stack Height Regulations,'' dated March 14, 1989.Copies of this document are available, upon request, from the EPA RegionalOffice listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> Section of this notice.C. Today's Action<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA proposes to approve and incorporate by reference revisions to section22a-174-1, ``Definitions,'' and section 22a-174-3, ``Permits to Constructand Permits to Operate,'' of the<T3> Regulations of Connecticut Department of Environmental ProtectionConcerning the Abatement of Air Pollution.</T3> These revisions satisfythe current provisions of 40 CFR 50.1(e), 51.100, and 51.118, which specifyambient air, stack height and dispersion techniques requirements for SIPs.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. PM<T2>10</T2> Revisions</ITAG>A. BackgroundOn July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated a revised national ambient air qualitystandard (NAAQS) for particulate matter (52 FR 2463). EPA revised the olddefinition of the NAAQS from the total suspended particulate (TSP) to anew definition. The new definition applies to particulate matter with aerodynamicdiameters of 10 micrometers or less.B. Summary of Connecticut's SubmittalOn January 20, 1989, the Connecticut DEP submitted amended regulationsto EPA as revisions to its SIP. These revisions incorporate PSD-relatedPM<T2>10</T2> requirements which include changes to section 22a-174-1, ``Definitions,''and section 22a-174-3, ``Permits to Construct and Permits to Operate StationarySouces or Modifications,'' of Connecticut's regulations. These amendmentsinclude the relevant definitions and PSD provisions for PM<T2>10</T2>. These amendments do not include the definitions of ``particulatematter emissions'' and ``PM<T2>10</T2> emissions,'' the PM<T2>10</T2> National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or the provisions relatedto significant harm levels and emergency episode plans for PM<T2>10</T2>. Future action by the State of Connecticut is required to addressthese definitions and provisions. The PSD revisions included in the January20, 1989 submittal meet the current federal PSD requirements in 40 CFR51.166 for PM<T2>10</T2>.Connecticut's PSD regulations for PM<T2>10</T2>, and EPA's evaluation are detailed in a memorandum dated April28, 1989 entitled, ``Technical Support Document_Connecticut's PM<T2>10</T2> Regulations.'' Copies of that document are available, uponrequest, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>Section of this notice.C. Today's Action<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Connecticut's PM<T2>10</T2> related revisions to section 22a-174-1, ``Definitions,'' andsection 22a-174-3, ``Permits to Construct and Permits to Operate StationarySources or Modifications'' of the <T3>Regulations of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Concerningthe Abatement of Air Pollution.</T3> These revisions incorporate the federalPSD PM<T2>10</T2> requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Connecticut's Ambient Impact Analysis Revisions</ITAG>A. BackgroundOn August 28, 1981 (46 FR 43418), EPA approved Connecticut's <T3>New Source Ambient Analysis Guideline </T3>as a nonregulatory additionto the Connecticut SIP. This guideline was approved for demonstrating protectionof the NAAQS for sulfur oxides by projecting the ambient air quality impactsof temporary increases of sulfur oxide emissions. These temporary revisionsof the Connecticut's SIP's sulfur-in-fuel limits were approved for sourcesto develop energy conservation measures. Since the time of EPA's approval,the Connecticut DEP has expanded the scope of its modeling guideline andupdated it to reflect developments and changes in EPA's modeling policies.B. Summary of Connecticut's SubmittalConnecticut's January 20, 1989 SIP submittal includes nonregulatory revisionsto its <T3>New Source Ambient Analysis Guideline. </T3>The revised guideline isnow entitled <T3>Ambient Impact Analysis Guideline </T3>and is specified in the narrativeportion of the SIP submittal for use in all NSR-related ambient impactanalyses conducted by the Connecticut DEP. EPA has evaluated Connecticut'sguideline and found that it is consistent, with the exception of the provisionsdiscussed below, with EPA's <T3>Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised) </T3>(dated July, 1986 assupplemented January, 1988) as required in 40 CFR 51.166(1).The Connecticut DEP's approach for conducting impact analyses is describedfully in its <T3>Ambient Impact Analysis Guideline, </T3>and EPA's review of the guidelineis contained in a memorandum dated April 28, 1889 entitled, ``TechnicalSupport Document_Connecticut's Ambient Impact Analysis Guideline.'' Copiesof that Document are available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Officelisted in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>Section of this Notice.C. Amendment's to Connecticut's Ambient Impact Analysis Guideline Necessaryfor Final Approval In Section 5.2.2, ``Sources,'' the guideline must require maximum actualshort-term emission rates rather than average actual emissions based onannual actual emissions. In Section 5.3.2, ``Meteorology for Refined Modeling,'' the guideline mustallow for consistency with EPA policy for on-site meteorological data forrefined modeling, which states that onsite data (one or more years, upto 5) are always preferable to off-site data. The guideline must specify when the source must conduct preconstructionmonitoring. Where the guideline refers to its Figures 5-1 through 5-6, use of the mostrecent 3 years of monitoring data available must be used by the sourcerather than the three years of data specifically applied for the depictionsin these figures. D. Today's Action <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve the revised version of Connecticut's <T3>Ambient Impact Analysis Guideline. </T3>These revisions satisfy thecurrent requirements in EPA's <T3>Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised) </T3>dated July, 1986, assupplemented January, 1988, as required in 40 CFR 51.166(1). EPA is proposingapproval with the understanding that the Connecticut DEP will make thenecessary additions and revisions to its guideline as outlined in thisnotice prior to final EPA approval of these revisions. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Miscellaneous Revisions </ITAG>A. Background Many of Connecticut's current federally approved SIP regulations applybased on a stationary source's ``actual emissions.'' EPA was able to approvethese regulations because Connecticut's definition of that term (i.e.,the definition currently in the SIP) was equivalent to the federal definitionof the term ``potential to emit.'' Connecticut has now adopted definitionsof the terms ``actual emissions'' and ``potential emissions'' which areequivalent to the current federal definitions in 40 CFR Part 51. Connecticut'snewly adopted definitions of ``actual emissions'' and ``potential emissions''could not be approved by EPA unless all of the current SIP's regulationswere also appropriately amended to incorporate these revised definitions.B. Summary of Connecticut's Submittal Connecticut's January 20, 1989 submittal includes revisions to sections22a-174-1 through 22a-174-100 of Connecticut's regulations to correctlyuse the terms ``actual emissions'' and ``potential emissions'' as describedabove. These revisions do not have any substantive effect in that theydo not change the scope of these regulations' applicability and they donot make these regulations more stringent or less stringent. The revisionsare wording changes to ensure that the regulations in Connecticut's SIPremain consistent for applicability purposes and in intent as originallyapproved by EPA. C. Today's Action <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve minor revisions to sections 22a-174-1 through22a-174-100 of the <T3>Regulations of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Concerningthe Abatement of Air Pollution </T3>to appropriately use the terms ``potentialemissions'' and ``actual emissions.'' These revisions ensure that the regulationsremain consistent for applicability purposes and in intent as originallyapproved by EPA. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Continuous Emission Monitoring Revisions </ITAG>A. Background Forty CFR 51.214 and 40 CFR Part 51 appendix P contain continuous emissionmonitoring (CEM) requirements which require existing stationary sourcesto install, calibrate, maintain, and operate equipment for continuouslymonitoring and recording emissions and to provide other information asspecified in 40 CFR part 51 appendix P. The CEM provisions of 40 CFR 51.214and part 51 Appendix P apply to non-NSPS subject fossil-fuel fired steamgenerators, sulfuric acid plants, nitric acid plants, and fluid bed catalyticcracking unit catalyst regenerators at petroleum refineries. B. Summary of Connecticut's Submittal On January 20, 1989, the Connecticut DEP submitted revisions to section22a-174-4, ``Source Monitoring, Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Authorizationof Inspection of Air Pollution Sources,'' of Connecticut's regulations.These revisions incorporate the applicable opacity CEM requirements forfossil fuel-fired steam generators set forth in 40 CFR 51.214 and 40 CFRPart 51, Appendix P. Connecticut's revisions do not include SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>x</T2> CEM requirements for fossil fuel-fired steam generators, andthe regulations do not include CEM requirements for sulfuric acid plants,nitric acid plants and fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regeneratorsat petroleum refineries. Connecticut's CEM regulation and EPA's evaluation are detailed in a memorandumdated May 3, 1989 entitled, ``Technical Support Document_Connecticut'sContinuous Emission Monitoring Regulation.'' Copies of that document areavailable, upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the ADDRESSESSection of this notice. C. Amendments Necessary for Final Approval As stated above, Connecticut's revisions only include requirements foropacity monitors at fossil fuel-fired steam generators. The ConnecticutDEP has informed EPA that no other applicable sources are located in theState. Therefore, prior to final rulemaking, the Connecticut DEP must clarifythe applicability and scope of its CEM regulation by certifying that thereare none of the following: 1. Sulfuric acid plants of greater than 300 tons per day production capacityin the State of Connecticut, 2. Nitric acid plants of greater than 300 tons per day production capacityin the State of Connecticut, 3. Fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators at petroleumrefineries in the State of Connecticut, 4. Fossil fuel-fired steam generators of greater than 250 million BTU perhour heat input which have installed sulfur dioxide pollutant control equipmentin the State of Connecticut, and 5. NO<T2>x</T2> control strategy areas in the State of Connecticut.D. Today's Action<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Connecticut's request to revise section 22a-174-4,``Source Monitoring, Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Authorization of Inspectionof Air Pollution Sources'' of the <T3>Regulations of Connecticut Department of Environmetal Protection Concerningthe Abatement of Air Pollution. </T3> These revisions incorporate opacityCEM requirements in accordance with 40 CFR 51.214 and 40 CFR part 51 appendixP. EPA is proposing approval with the understanding that the ConnecticutDEP will submit the certification discussed in this notice prior to finalrulemaking. In adopting the Act, Congress designated EPA as the agency primarily responsiblefor interpreting the statutory provisions and overseeing their implementationby the states. EPA must approve state programs that meet the requirementsof 40 CFR part 51. Conversely, EPA cannot approve programs that do notmeet those requirements. However, the requirements of the Act and 40 CFRpart 51 for NSR including those for PSD, stack heights/dispersion techniques,and ambient impact analyses, are by nature very complex and dynamic. Itwould be administratively impracticable to include all statutory interpretationsin the EPA regulations and the SIPS of the various states, or to amendthe regulations and SIPS every time EPA interprets the statute or regulationsor issues guidance regarding the proper implementation of the NSR program.Moreover, the Act does not require EPA to do so. Rather, action by EPAto approve these NSR-related regulations and narrative as part of the ConnecticutSIP still have the effect of requiring the state to follow EPA's currentand future interpretations of the Act's provisions and regulations, aswell as EPA's operating policies and guidance (but only to the extent thatsuch policies are intended to guide the implementation of approved stateNSR programs). Similarly, EPA approval also will have the effect of supercedingany interpretations or policies that the state might otherwise follow tothe extent they are at variance with EPA's interpretations and applicablepolicies. Of course, any fundamental changes in the administration of NSRwould have to be accomplished through amendments to the regulations in40 CFR part 51 and subsequent SIP revisions. Upon approval of these revisions to the NSR requirements of the ConnecticutSIP, EPA will continue to oversee implementation of this important programby reviewing and commenting upon proposed permits as appropriate. Specifically,EPA will comment upon proposed permits that do not implement the letterof the law, as well as EPA's statutory and regulatory interpretations andapplicable guidance. If a final permit is issued which still does not reflectconsideration of the relevant factors, EPA may deem the permit inadequatefor purposes of implementing the requirements of the Act and Connecticut'sSIP, and may consider enforcement action under sections 113 and 167 ofthe Act to address the permit deficiency.EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Connecticut SIP, submittedon January 20, 1989, and is soliciting public comments on the issues discussedin this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments will be consideredbefore taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federalrulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA RegionalOffice listed in the <T3>ADDRESSES </T3>Section of this notice.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revisionwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K)and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR part 51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation byreference, Intergovernmental relations, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Particulatematter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur dioxide.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul G.
