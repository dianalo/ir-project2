(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As ``Baby M'' turns 3 this month, thecontroversy that surrounded her birth to a surrogate mother hasdiminished little.   More than 60 bills have been introduced in state legislatures andthree in Congress to ban, regulate or study surrogacy since theMarch 27, 1986, birth to Mary Beth Whitehead of the little girl shewas paid $10,000 to carry.   Melissa, as Baby M now is named, lives with William and ElizabethStern in Tenafly, with one six-hour visit a week from her biologicalmother. Her parents won't talk about the case, their daughter, orthe woman who bore her and is now engaged in a 22-city promotionaltour for her book, ``A Mother's Story.''   ``I really thought this was something special,'' said Mrs.Whitehead-Gould, now married to Dean Gould, whose child _ her fifth_ she is expecting in July. ``I really thought it was a way for anempty-armed couple to have a child.''   ``I really was naive,'' she said recently. She criticized theclinic where she was inseminated with Stern's sperm for inadequatelyexplaining the process and how she might feel, but realizes sheshould have asked more questions.   ``I thought it was something so wonderful. You don't think of thebad. ... I didn't want to hurt the Sterns. It was very hard to tellthem, `No, you can't have the baby''' she named Sara _ the name onthe birth certificate. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould returned the $10,000 toStern.   The case ``alerted the public to in vitro research,'' said RobertD. Arenstein, a New York lawyer for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould who hasbeen working for the past year with the Washington-based NationalCoalition Against Surrogacy.   ``You just can't take somebody's baby away from them. All thesethings had never been addressed in a contract,'' Arenstein said.   The coalition sees surrogacy as ``a creation of tragedy,'' saidits lawyer, Andrew Kimbrell. The group was established partly toprovide low-cost legal aid to women involved in surrogacy contractsand as a support network for them.   Among supporters of surrogacy is Gary N. Skoloff, a lawyer forStern.   ``One out of seven married couples in the United States areinfertile,'' Skoloff said. ``Since medical science has now figuredout a way for a couple to have a child through artificialinsemination, it ought to be legalized but be well-regulated.   ``If adoption can be well-regulated then surrogacy can bewell-regulated.''   The New Jersey Supreme Court, while awarding custody of Baby M toWilliam Stern, last year outlawed surrogacy for pay in the state.State Sen. Catherine Costa has introduced a bill to regulatearrangements for surrogacy contracts.   Louisiana, Nebraska and Kentucky have declared surrogacycontracts void and unenforceable. Michigan also assesses criminalpenalties for paid surrogacy. An Indiana law prohibits the statefrom enforcing a surrogacy contract. In Florida surrogacy-for-hireis illegal, but a woman can voluntarily bear a child for someoneelse and be reimbursed for medical and some living expenses.   At least three bills have been introduced in Congress to bansurrogacy, to prohibit federal enforcement of the contracts and tobar use of federal money to help veterans get children throughsurrogacy.   The American Bar Association, without endorsing surrogatemotherhood, last month offered a blueprint for legalizing surrogacy.It suggested that contracts be limited to married couples and asurrogate mother who would have 180 days to change her mind afterconception. A judge would have to approve the pact beforeconception, and the egg or the sperm would have to come from thecouple.   Skoloff believes surrogacy will be debated until it's legalizedin three or four states where all couples will go. ``The whole ideais to protect kids, and having no statute is giving them the leastamount of protection,'' he said.   ``A Mother's Story,'' written with investigative journalistLoretta Schwartz-Nobel and published by St. Martin's Press Inc.,begins with the birth and is limited by court order only to Baby M'ssecond birthday.   The Sterns tried to block the book, arguing it would exploit thechild. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 31, said she wrote the book so herdaughter would know her side of the story, and to help her otherchildren cope with the case.   ``It's pretty much over for me,'' she said. ``But I hope if onewoman reads this, she will think again about her doing it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday PMs March 13</NOTE></DOC>
