But both government and Drexel officials say the unusualarrangement is legal, does not pose a conflict of interest for theWall Street firm and does not violate its plea agreement thatsettled securities fraud charges.   ``We've got a criminal investigation and prosecution going on,''Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said Tuesday. ``It's abouthistoric acts. It's irrelevant who cuts a check to pay what lawyer.''   Carroll said Drexel is not violating any agreement with thegovernment by paying lawyers' fees for Milken, who records show mademore than $1 billion from 1984 to 1987. Drexel has agreed to severall business ties with Milken.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm, under companypolicy, also is paying the legal fees for other employees involvedin the continuing investigation of trading practices involvingDrexel, its employees and clients.   Under its plea agreement with federal prosecutors, finalizedMonday, Drexel is immune from further criminal charges but mustcooperate with the U.S. attorney's office investigation.   Drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts and immediately paidmore than $500 million of its $673 million in fines and penalties.The plea, in which Drexel admitted it manipulated stock anddefrauded investors and customers, ended nine months of wranglingover an agreement that avoided a possible racketeering indictment.   Milken remains government target No. 1 and prosecutors havepromised a new, broader set of charges about Oct. 1 that should bearout some of Drexel's cooperation.   Drexel also has given the government dozens of documents andtrading records. The firm has hired an outside accountant to analyzesome of the records. Whenever prosecutors wish to speak withemployees, Drexel has to make them accessible under its plea-bargainagreement.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the government is pleased withthe extent of Drexel's cooperation.   Several Drexel traders and other employees currently areanswering prosecutors' questions. Some, such as salesman James Dahl,have been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for theirtestimony. Others, such as chief junk bond trader Warren Trepp, haverefused to answer any questions.   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader BruceNewberg were charged in a 98-count securities fraud indictment inMarch alleging racketeering, insider trading, tax fraud and otherviolations.   Those charges focus on alleged collusion between Milken andjailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky, but the new indictment nowunder preparation is expected to contain broader charges.   Prosecutors plan to identify but not charge Drexel clientsSolomon Asset Management and Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association inthe expanded indictment, according to a report Tuesday in TheWashington Post. Boesky's firm and the defunct Princeton-NewportPartners LP were named in the original charges.   The government will allege that Milken directed a series ofillegal stock and bond trading arrangements with the clients, thenewspaper said. Prosecutors are assembling witnesses to testifyabout the alleged dealings at Milken's trial, scheduled to beginnext March, the report said.   Columbia's general counsel, Ken Heitz, has acknowledged that theLos Angeles-based thrift tried to ``implement its tax planning''through heavy year-end trades with Drexel and other firms, butdenied any wrongdoing, the Post reported.   Attempts to reach David Solomon, former head of Solomon AssetManagement, failed Tuesday. The firm has changed its name and saidSolomon no longer worked there.   Carroll declined to comment on the report. Milken's publicrelations spokesman said in a statement: ``The continuing pressleaks related to the case are designed to deny Mike Milken his rightto a fair trial. Mike Milken has pleaded not guilty and will fightthe charges in court, not in the newspaper.''   In addition to the Milkens and Newberg, other Drexel employeesare expected to be charged in the new indictment. At least fourDrexel officials late last year were told by the government toexpect charges. A person involved in the case said Tuesday he knewof no others.</TEXT></DOC>
