William C. Miller, chief of naval research, afterunexpectedly announcing during a congressional hearing that the check had beenrejected. Miller said that Wednesday, after receiving the check, he calledStanford President Donald Kennedy and James C. Gaither, chairman of Stanford'sboard of trustees, &quot;and expressed to them my disappointment in thatapproach.&quot;;    Embarrassed once again at a hearing on Capitol Hill, Stanfordofficials acted quickly. Debra L. Zumwalt, the university's senior attorney,met for several hours Thursday afternoon at the Arlington, Va., site of theOffice of Naval Research, the agency that oversees government grantsdistributed to Stanford and many other schools.;    She emerged at dusk with aletter from the office thanking Stanford for both its cooperation and twochecks, one for $924,517 and the other for $105,600, according to LarryHorton, Stanford's associate vice president for public affairs.;    The twosides also exchanged letters stating that neither waived its legal rightsregarding the repayment, Horton said. The government stated that it was notwaiving its right to interest on the refund. Nor did it agree with Stanford'scontention that, instead of paying cash, it could have subtracted the refundfrom next year's research cost overhead reimbursement. Stanford agreed toremove the 20-word clause.;    The repayment from Stanford followedallegations that the university overcharged the federal government millions ofdollars for research overhead.;    (Stanford released a report of its own thisweek, in response to congressional testimony last month that the universitywasn't providing access to documents essential to this case. The reportrebutted the claim, saying Stanford is so overwhelmed with requests for papersthat it sometimes is slow responding. This was the second time auditors hadcomplained about Stanford's lack of cooperation.);    The Department of Healthand Human Services has been investigating university overcharges since lastyear. The hearing Thursday was Congress' fourth on the subject but the firstto focus on schools besides Stanford.;    Accounting sins;  Instead,accounting sins at 12 other leading universities were disclosed by Health andHuman Services auditors who said the dozen, including Yale University andDartmouth College, attempted to claim $14 million in improper expenses asresearch costs.;    Eight of the 12 have withdrawn questionable billings worth$9.5 million, said Richard Kusserow, inspector general of Health and HumanServices, which oversees research funding at most schools.;    Theuniversities publicized Thursday included the University of SouthernCalifornia, Duke University, Johns Hopkins, the University of Pennsylvania,Emory, the University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis, RutgersUniversity, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KRISTIN HUCKSHORN, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910510  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  17A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  526  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 10, 199100131036,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
