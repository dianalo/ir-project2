The research could be used by brewers and other alcoholproducers to fight efforts in some states to lowerblood-alcohol limits for drivers. Such laws would put lightand moderate drinkers at risk of tough drunk-drivingpenalties.</LP><TEXT>   The study, performed by the Traffic Injury ResearchFoundation of Canada and presented to law-enforcementofficials in Denver, indicates the average blood-alcohollevel of fatally injured drunk drivers in the U.S. was about0.17% in 1990, the year for which the data were collected.The legal limit in most states is 0.10%.   Herb Simpson, executive director of the research group,said he thinks the research indicates law enforcementofficials should reallocate their resources and efforts tocatching and rehabilitating the &quot;hard core&quot; drinker, ratherthan the &quot;social&quot; drinker. The hard-core drinker, or one withhigh blood-alcohol levels, is 200 times more likely to beinvolved in a fatal crash than non-drinking drivers, Dr.Simpson's research found.   Anheuser-Busch opposes lowering blood-alcohol limits to0.08% or 0.05%, as is being considered in several states, andwill disseminate the research data in various states whereblood-alcohol limits are an issue, said Stephen Lambright,vice president at the company.</TEXT></DOC>
