(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy outmuscled Greenpeaceanti-nuclear protesters Monday, crippling their vessels and towingthem out of an area where they tried unsuccessfully to halt thetest launch of a Trident 2 missile.   The high seas drama took place in the Atlantic 50 miles off theFlorida coast just before the nuclear-powered submarine Tennesseeunleashed the $26.5 million missile on a test that put the Trident2 program back on track after two explosive failures in the firstthree undersea launches.   ``We did a perfect launch, just beuatiful,'' Vice Adm. RogerBacon, commander of the Atlantic Submarine Fleet, said at a newsconference.   The Navy said its ships had to ``shoulder'' aside a large shipcarrying protesters, and capture and tow away two high-speed raftscalled Zodiacs from the launch area.   Greenpeace USA peace activists said the Navy rammed their ship,aimed fire hoses down its smoke stacks to stop its engines and thatNavy divers had sliced the fuel lines and punctured the pontoons onthe Zodiacs.   Bacon said hoses were used and that Navy sailors in rafts cutthe fuel lines on one of the Zodiacs after the other broke down inheavy seas.   Three Navy helicopters made life even more miserable for the twomen in each of the Zodiacs by hovering overhead, making alreadychoppy seas even choppier.   Shannon Fagan, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said a Navyship, the 254-foot submarine support ship USS Grasp, left twogashes in the hull of the MV Greenpeace, a 190-foot ocean-goingtug. She said the largest, about 3 feet long, was stuffed withmattresses to keep water out.   Cmdr. Deborah Burnette, a Navy spokeswoman, said Navy officialsat the scene reported only one hole about 1 foot in diameter in theGreenpeace hull.   ``This is a terrible outrage,'' said Peter Bahouth, executivedirector of Greenpeace USA, in a statement. ``This is an unbridledact of aggression against a peaceful protest in internationalwaters.''   Fagan said Greenpeace was considering legal action against theNavy.   Greenpeace had successfully used the ship and Zodiacs to block aTrident 2 launch attempt July 28. But the Navy was ready for themthis time.   ``We were more prepared today because we looked at what theytried to do on July 28, and we used the minimum force necessarytoday to clear the area,'' Bacon said.   Once the protesters' vessels were muscled outside the 5,000-yarddiameter safety circle, the Tennessee sent the 44-foot missileshooting out of a tube in the deck. It broke the Atlantic surface,ignited and propelled a dummy warhead package to an ocean targetseveral thousand miles away.   The Navy announced the success about 20 minutes after the 10:40a.m. launch.   ``We issued repeated warnings to clear the area,'' Burnette saidof the Greenpeace incident. ``The MV Greenpeace acknowledged ourwarnings and declared its intention to stay in the area. Twosubmarine support ships, Grasp and Kittiwake, shouldered it out ofthe safety arc.''   Burnette said the warning told the protesters that if the shipdid not move, the Navy ``will exercise its rights underinternational law and will forcibly remove you.''   The MV Greenpeace radioed back, ``You are doing your best butyou haven't sunk us yet; we are staying.''   Fagan said the ship was ``dead in the water'' for a while afterthe Navy ships poured water down the smoke stacks, but the crew gotone of the two engines restarted and the ship headed for port inJacksonville, Fla., after non-essential people were taken off byhelicopter.   The incident began shortly after the nuclear submarine USSTennessee submerged for the attempt to launch the Trident 2 missileon its fourth test flight.   Two of the first three Trident 2 launches from the submarineended in explosions just above the surface. The second in theseries was declared a success by the Navy.   The failures, blamed on an inadequately designed nozzle system,had set back the plan to send operational Trident 2s to sea latethis year. But if the program continues to succeed over about halfa dozen more undersea launches, the Tennessee is scheduled to go onoperational patrol next spring with 24 of the deadly missiles. Eachis capable of hurling up to 12 nuclear warheads to differenttargets more than 4,600 miles away.   Nineteen land-launch tests, 15 of them successful, preceded thesea trials.</TEXT></DOC>
