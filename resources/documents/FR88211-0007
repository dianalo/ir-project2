Overview </ITAG>The Office, as the primary regulator for national banks, is responsiblefor fostering the safety and soundness of the national banking system.The Office believes that periodic financial disclosure is needed, not onlyto facilitate informed decision-making by existing and potential customers,but also to improve public understanding of the financial condition ofindividual banks. In the Office's view, improved financial disclosure shouldreduce the likelihood that the market will overreact to incomplete information.The Office believes that the required disclosure of financial informationwill complement its supervisory efforts and enhance public confidence inthe banking system. This final ru1e requires a national bank to prepare and make availablean annual disclosure statement, beginning with data for calendar year 1987.Under the rule, the bank must display, in the lobby of the main officeand in each branch, a notice of the annual disclosure statement's availability.Stockholders must similarly be notified in the bank's notice of its annualshareholders' meeting. The data required to be disclosed in the annual disclosure statement arethe same data that banks currently provide in the Reports of Conditionand Income (``Call Reports''). The Office believes that the public is notgenerally aware that those reports are available from the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC). This rule will ensure that relevant dataare more readily available to the general public and that the public ismade aware of this availability. The disclosures required by this rule represent the minimum a bank mustmake. National banks are free, and are encouraged, to make more frequentor expanded disclosures. For example, a bank might wish to supplement therequired data with a narrative discussion of the financial statements.If the annual disclosure statement is to serve its purpose, such narrativesshould be written clearly, in terms that can be understood by the reader.Furthermore, each annual disclosure statement must include a legend statingthat the Office has not verified or confirmed the accuracy of the informationpresented. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Background </ITAG>This final rule is the result of three and one-half years of effort involvingthree requests for public comment on a disclosure program for nationalbanks. On July 13, 1984, the Office published an Advance Notice of ProposedRulemaking (49 FR 28566) soliciting comment on a wide range of issues relevantto developing an improved disclosure program for national banks. The 130comments received were considered in seeking a second round of commentin the form of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 50 FR 45372 (Oct. 30, 1985).In this Notice, the Office proposed extensive amendments to Part 18 incorporatingmany disclosures currently required of banks and bank holding companiessubject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Office regulations in12 CFR Part 11. The Office received 706 comments, mostly from banks, bankholding companies, trade and banking organizations, and state banking associations.Two public hearings were held at which 25 witnesses representing banks,banking associations, and consumer groups testified. As a result of thesecomments, major changes were made in the proposal, which was then publishedfor another round of comment, 52 FR 23456 (June 22, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Comments Received Regarding the Second Notice </ITAG>Approximately 62 comments were received in response to the second Notice.With few exceptions, those who commented were banks, bank holding companies,state bankers associations, and other trade associations. Slightly morethan half of the commenters favored the approach proposed, with many makingrecommendations for improvement. Described below are the most significantissues and the Office's response. 1. Compliance Will Cause Unnecessary Burden Burden was cited by numerous commenters as a reason not to implement adisclosure program. Large banks felt that their filings with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) were sufficient and that requiring each bankin a holding company to disclose would be burdensome. Small banks feltthat manpower constraints would make compliance difficult. On the otherhand, several commenters stated that the proposal was not particularlyburdensome and were pleased that the same data compiled in the Call Reportscould be used to meet the rule's requirements. The Office has made an effort to reduce the burden on banks by limitingthe required disclosure to data compiled for the Call Reports. This finalrule does not require the compilation or disclosure of new data. 2. The General Public Is Not Interested Several commenters stated that the general public is not interested inthe information; that the public's main interest is in FDIC insurance.For that reason, the commenters stated that preparation of the annual disclosurestatement is unnecessary and that banks would receive few requests forthe information. As further evidence of the public's lack of interest,they noted that few members of the general public took the opportunityto comment on the proposal. The Office feels that the public is not necessarily disinterested in theinformation, but is probably not aware of its existence. By publicizingthe availability of the information, the public may become more aware ofit and thus request it. Even if individuals rarely request the annual disclosurestatement, they will be aware, through the required lobby posting, thatthe information is available, and this in itself should foster greaterpublic confidence in the banking system. 3. The Information Will Be Misunderstood Several banks expressed concern that the media will misrepresent the informationand unduly alarm the public. Moreover, some commenters suggested that thepublic probably would not understand the information. Current economicproblems were also cited as a reason not to make the information more widelyavailable. The Office feels that a bank can reduce any misunderstanding by providinga narrative discussion of the data, an option included in this rule. 4. Enough Information Is Currently Available Several commenters asserted that the information being required is alreadyavailable to the public. For this reason, copying it or otherwise advertisingits availability is unnecessary. People who want it can get it now. However, several commenters stated that, while the information is currentlyavailable, the general public is not aware of it, and this regulation,with its required lobby posting, should increase awareness. The commentersasserted that the public needs to be reminded of the existence of the informationand how to obtain it. This would give the public an opportunity to decidewhether to request the information. The Office agrees, and believes thata lobby posting is the least costly means of securing this objective. 5. The Same Information Should Be Available From All Financial InstitutionsSeveral commenters cited possible inconsistencies if all financial institutionsare not required to prepare and disseminate comparable data. They assertedthat in order to truly compare institutions, all should report similarly.The Office agrees and has sought to attain this objective in discussionswith other federal regulatory agencies. The FDIC has adopted a similarregulation that would apply to state chartered non-member banks and insuredstate licensed branches of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve Board isconsidering a regulation for public comment to accomplish similar goals.Thus, it is anticipated that virtually all commercial banks will be disclosingon a comparable basis. 6. Banks Should Be Allowed to Charge a Reasonable Fee Several commenters stated that shareholders are entitled to free financialinformation, but that others are not and therefore should be charged. Othercommenters suggested that shareholders and current customers should receivethe information without charge, but that the general public should be charged.A few commenters argued that the FDIC should provide the data. One of the objectives of this regulation is to ensure that adequate informationis easily available to enable a potential customer to compare one bankwith another for the purpose of deciding where to do business. Accordingly,the information should be available at no cost to enable a potential customerthe opportunity to review the information from several banks. For thisreason, the Office decided that the first copy to each requestor shouldbe without charge. 7. Make the Information Available by March 31 A few commenters suggested that the date by which the annual disclosurestatement must be available should be changed to March 31 instead of March1. They pointed out that SEC and 12 CFR 11 filings are not required untilMarch 31. In addition, some expressed concern that their audited figureswould probably not be available until after March 1. The Office is concerned that by not requiring the information to be availableuntil March 31, the information will be fully one quarter old. However,in an effort to minimize the burden of furnishing information sooner forone requirement (<T3>i.e., </T3>12 CFR Part 18), than for another (<T3>i.e., </T3>12 CFR Part 11), the Office has changed the availabilitydate to March 31. The Office encourages banks to make every effort to havethe information available prior to that date.8. Differences Between GAAP and Regulatory Reporting Standards are ConfusingSeveral comments argued that accounting differences between regulatoryreporting standards and General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cancause confusion and prevent a meaningfu1 comparison of data provided bydifferent banks. Accordingly, some commenters requested that all reportingconform to GAAP. In the Office's view, this final rule is not the appropriatevehicle to effect such a major change, but the suggestion will be consideredin other contexts. The Office agrees that, in some circumstances, confusion could arise bycomparing statements prepared according to regulatory reporting standardswith those prepared according to GAAP. However, the regulation does notrequire that a bank present statements according to regulatory reportingstandards. If it wishes, a bank may present its annual disclosure statementusing audited statements. 9. Another Required Lobby Posting Will Cause Clutter Some banks suggested that requiring the addition of another lobby postingwill only serve to add to the clutter in the lobby. They stated that noone seems to pay much attention to the postings currently required. Onecommenter requested that size specifications for the posting be includedin the regulation. Another commenter stated that the FDIC should providethe posting. Yet another requested that there be specific required languagein the posting. The lobby posting requirement was suggested by several commenters to thefirst Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. They stated that a lobby posting wouldbe the best way to notify the public of the availability of information.The Office has chosen not to specify size requirements or language in theposting in an effort to give the bank an opportunity to gear the postingto its lobby size and structure. As noted earlier, the Office believesthat the lobby posting will cause public awareness of the availabilityof the disclosures to increase, thereby promoting increased confidencein the banking system. 10. Exemptions Several commenters cited three classes of banks that should be exempt frompreparing an annual disclosure statement: Bank subsidiaries of one-bankholding companies with no significant non-bank subsidiaries; banks withfewer than a specified number of shareholders; and federal branches andagencies. To promote confidence in individual banks and in the banking system asa whole, no national bank should be exempt from the requirements of thisregulation. The number of shareholders is not relevant, since the disclosuresare designed for the general public, including prospective customers. However,in the case of a one-bank holding company where the bank comprises at least95% of the holding company's consolidated total assets and total liabilities,the bank may use the holding company's filing to comply with this regulation.As far as federal branches and agencies are concerned, the Office feelsthat they should make disclosures similar to those required of nationalbanks. For that reason, certain schedules of their Call Reports must alsobe disclosed. 11. Notice of Availability Commenters expressed confusion regarding whether every branch had to havea supply of statements available and whether all holding company shareholdershad to be notified of the availability of bank data. Section 18.8 states that the bank must respond promptly to a request foran annual disclosure statement. As long as the required posting is in thelobby of each branch, there is nothing to preclude a bank from having acentral distribution point from which to fill all requests. It is not necessaryfor all holding company shareholders to be notified of the availabilityof bank data. <ITAG tagnum="84">D. Office Action </ITAG>The Office has considered carefully the comments and testimony received.Further, the Office perceives a need for the public to become more awarethat the banking system and its components are vital and healthy entities.Accordingly, the Office has attempted to design a disclosure program thatwill prove useful to the public without imposing an undue burden on nationalbanks. Therefore, the Office is publishing the following final revisions to Part18. Each national bank and federal branches and agencies, beginning withcalendar year 1987, shall prepare and make available an annual disclosurestatement by March 31, 1988. This annual disclosure statement must containrequired financial information and may contain an optional narrative discussionas set forth in andSection; 18.4. Information contained in the annual disclosurestatement is intended for the benefit of shareholders, depositors, andother interested persons. Shareholders will continue to be notified ofthe availability of the information before the annual meeting of shareholders,as currently provided in Part 18. Others will be notified through a noticeprominently displayed in the lobby of the main office and each branch.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Discussion of Requirements </ITAG>1. Annual Disclosure Statement (See andSection; 18.4) The annual disclosure statement must contain the same information, allof which currently is publicly available, provided in the following schedulesfrom the bank's Call Report (this information is to be provided for theyear being reported and the preceding year): (a) Balance sheet (Schedule RC); (b) Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans and Leases (Schedule RC-N) (Note: Loansand leases past due 30-89 days are not currently publicly available andneed not be disclosed); (c) Income Statement (Schedule RI); (d) Changes in Equity Capital (Schedule RI-A); and (e) Charge-Offs and Recoveries and Changes in Allowance for Loan and LeaseLosses (Schedule RI-B). In the case of federal branches and agencies, the following schedules oftheir Call Reports are required for the year being reported and the precedingyear: (a) Assets and Liabilities (Schedule RAL).(b) Deposit Liabilities and Credit Balances (Schedule E). (c) Other Borrowed Money (Schedule P). 2. Optional Narrative (See andSection; 18.4(c)) The bank, at its option, may provide additional information that it deemssignificant including, for example, a narrative discussion. This narrativemight include a discussion of the financial data and other informationwhich bank management deems important to evaluate the condition of thebank. Under certain circumstances, the Office may require the disclosureof specific information, such as an enforcement action when the Officedeems it in the public interest to disclose this information. Types ofenforcement actions which might be disclosed include those addressing insiderabuse. 3. Use of Shareholder Annual Report by Registered Banks (See andSection;18.5) A national bank having a class of securities registered pursuant to section12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may meet the requirements ofthis rule by providing to requestors its annual report to shareholdersprepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities ExchangeAct and the Office's rules in 12 CFR Part 11. 4. Notification and Delivery (See andSection;andSection; 18.7 and 18.8) National banks shall notify shareholders of the availability of the annualdisclosure statement in conjunction with the notice of the annual shareholders'meeting. Banks shall notify the general public by posting a notice in thelobby of the main office and each branch office of the bank. The notice,prominently displayed at all times, shall state that the annual disclosurestatement is available and provide information about how to obtain it.The bank may not charge for the first copy requested by any person andmust supply the information promptly. 5. Disclosure of Examination Reports (See andSection; 18.9) While banks are encouraged to supplement the minimum disclosure of financialinformation with other information about the bank as appropriate, banksare not permitted to disclose any report of examination or other reportof supervisory activity, or any portion thereof, prepared by the Office.6. Prohibited Conduct and Safe Harbor (See andSection;andSection; 18.10 and18.11) Banks shall not provide false or misleading information, or omit pertinentinformation. Information about future prospects, based on accurate currentinformation will not be considered false or misleading if the prospectsare not ultimately fulfilled. By providing a safe harbor from penalty provisions,the Office seeks to encourage bank management to present information concerningfuture direction and plans. 7. Penalties (See andSection; 18.10) Violations of andSection; 18.10 of the rule may subject the bank, its officers,directors, employees, or others participating in its affairs, to enforcementaction by the Office. The precise nature of any action would, of course,depend on the particular facts and circumstances. The Office could, forexample, assess civil money penalties. <ITAG tagnum="84">F. This Final Rule Versus Current 12 CFR Part 18 </ITAG>Currently, Part 18 requires disclosure of certain financial informationto shareholders of national banks. However, there are three major differencesbetween the present disclosure requirement and this final rule. The firstdifference is that this rule requires that information be made availableto the general public, as well as shareholders. The second major differenceis that the annual disclosure statements will include past due loan informationcurrently available to the public in the Call Report. The third differenceis that the bank may supplement the minimum disclosure requirement withinformation it deems important. <ITAG tagnum="84">G. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. No.96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), this final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">H. Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>Pursuant to Executive Order 12291, it has been determined that this finalrule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies or geographic regions; and will not havean adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,or the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">I.
