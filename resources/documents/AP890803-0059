The Senate, which approved the bill 95-4 Wednesday, leftrelatively intact the dollars and the structure of the strategicweapons programs. The House last week made deep cuts denounced bythe White House as irresponsible both in terms of national securityand arms control.   ``In my judgment, this will be the most difficult conference ina decade,'' said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republicanon the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``But I'm confident that wecan emerge with a bill which will meet the president's basic policygoals.''   ``It's going to be very difficult,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,the committee chairman. ``There are more profound differences withthe House than we have had for a long, long time.''   Nunn was asked how he will enter the conference that opens Sept.8. ``Well armed,'' he replied.   How does he expect to emerge? ``Alive,'' Nunn said.   About the cuts made by the House, Nunn said: ``We will be veryinterested in hearing their logic. It doesn't leap out at you.''   The Senate bill, which conforms closely to Bush'srecommendations, calls for a modest cut of $400 million in the $4.9billion request for the Star Wars antimissile shield.   It endorses the B-2 stealth bomber if it meets flight test andradar-evasion standards. It takes only a token $300 million bitefrom the administration's $4.7 billion request for the bat-wingedaircraft.   The Senate also backed the $1.1 billion request to make the MXmissile a mobile rather than a stationary target by placing theweapons on railway cars.   And it left intact the $100 million earmarked for thesingle-warhead Midgetman missile.   The House took a sharply different course.   Members strictly limited production of the B-2 bomber, pressingthe Pentagon to produce a program far cheaper than the $70 billionprice tag for 132 planes now envisioned.   They slashed the Star Wars request by $1.8 billion and deleted$502 million intended to help make the MX a mobile missile. Andthey removed all of the $100 million for the Midgetman.   As the Senate completed work on the bill, Sen. Mark Hatfield,R-Ore., decried the ever-mounting spending for the military.   ``This Congress _ a bipartisan majority of this Congress _ hasapproved $2.2 trillion of the $2.3 trillion requested for defensespending during this decade alone,'' Hatfield said.   ``We seem to have lost sight of the fact that every dollar wespend on bombs and bullets means that we are underfunding programsto meet the nation's desperate human needs: health care, education,war on drugs, low income housing, AIDS research.   ``Our motto ought to be `In Bombs We Trust,''' Hatfield said.   In other action Wednesday, the Senate:   _Brushed aside a final attempt to change the administration'sstrategic blueprint, sidetracking a proposal to restrict thePentagon's ability to conduct anti-satellite tests.   _Urged Bush to continue development of the Marine Corps' V-22Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft the administration sought tocancel. The Osprey takes off like a helicopter but can fly like aplane.   _Approved an amendment requiring graduates of the nation'smilitary academies to give six years of service after graduationrather than the eight required by the bill. The reason: The longerterm might discourage academy applications.   _Told the CIA and Defense Department to report by Sept. 1 on howbest to locate and rescue American hostages in Lebanon.   Voting against the bill were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; TomHarkin, D-Iowa; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Hatfield. Sen.Donald Riegle, D-Mich., did not vote.</TEXT></DOC>
