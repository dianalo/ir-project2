In order to reduce this drawback,the authors gave a local anesthetic (Tetracaine) to the patients undergoingDSA of aortic arch and carotid arteries. Hundred-twenty-three subjectsdivided into two groups were examined: Tetracaine was administred toone group (64 patients) and not to the other (59 cases). In the firstgroup deglutition artifacts were not noted in 59/64 cases. Among thosepatients not treated with Tetracaine/deglutition artifacts were absentin 45/59 cases. This local anesthetic did not produce important toxicreactions. Therefore the authors belive that administration of localanesthetics can reduce deglutition artifact in DSA of neck vessels.</TEXT></DOC>
