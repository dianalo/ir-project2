He certainly is the bank robber of the present, or at least the recent past.    Using blank white-plastic cards and a little machine he bought for $1,800, says the government, Mr. Post last year robbed automated tellers around the city of $86,000, aided by bank customers who unwittingly supplied him with account information.    Mr. Post hasn't yet been indicted in the so-far-unpublicized case. But in an interview that he himself sought after his arrest, the 35-year-old electronics expert from Poland, who became a U.S. citizen in 1979, proudly took credit for beating the cash machines.    &quot;They said I was a magician,&quot; he said of his Secret Service interrogators. &quot;They couldn't believe it's just me. They said, 'Where's the brain? Where's the brain?'&quot;    &quot;He knew how to beat the machine,&quot; says Richard Ward, special agent in charge of the New York office of the Secret Service, which investigates fraudulent uses of access devices. Mr. Ward calls the scheme unique in that it was so successful for so long; it didn't involve the theft of any cash cards; and Mr. Post seems to have acted alone whereas most such crimes are committed by a ring.    He was caught only because he lingered at a Chemical Bank branch one night for a minute too long. Recently he skipped bail -- a $25,000 personal recognizance bond -- and is being sought by U.S. marshals.    The elusive Mr. Post is a banker's nightmare. With his knowledge of electronics and automated-teller machines -- he once had a job servicing ATMs -- he became the kind of bank robber that banks have dreaded since the first ATM was introduced in 1973.    Today more than 64,000 such machines are in use nationwide, and the story of Mr. Post's success is a sobering one for banks and other institutions relying on cash cards. &quot;The industry's in a fragile state,&quot; and news about ATM crime erodes consumer confidence in the machines, says James Callan, a spokesman for the Electronic Funds Transfer Association, an industry group. Adds Norman R. Bottom, a Miami-based security consultant:    &quot;Banks are dreadfully concerned about fraud with the machines. . . . {But} they don't like to talk about it a lot because it gives people ideas.&quot;    Mr. Post's idea was this: Staking out cash machines, he would look over customers' shoulders to learn the secret personal-identification numbers, or PINs, that they tap into the machine. Then, if a customer didn't pocket his receipt after getting his cash -- a common sin of omission -- Mr. Post would retrieve it to learn the customer's account number.    The next step was to do the actual forging at his East Side apartment. Using his $1,800 machine, he would imprint a code on a black magnetic strip on one of his blank plastic cards, a strip resembling the one on the back of the customer's own card. This homemade code was the secret of Mr. Post's success. But it was his reconnaissance missions at automated-teller machines that made the code possible, because to imprint it, he needed to know the customer's PIN and his account number.    And he needed more than that: his general knowledge of electronics and the specific knowledge of ATMs that he gleaned on his old job.    The scheme worked fine, and Mr. Post went around town for months entering cash machines, often Chemical's, to steal money from bank customers, apparently always customers of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical are part of the same cash-machine network, and Mr. Post had evidently learned something about Manufacturers Hanover accounts when he serviced ATMs.    Still, Mr. Post's method had a fatal flaw, and the flaw was eventually detected by a Manufacturers Hanover computer that gunned him down just before 9 p.m. last Oct. 21. The flaw, according to the government's complaint against Mr. Post, had to do with that portion of the coding information that involves the account number. While Mr. Post's coding was good enough to work, it consistently set off bells at the bank.    On the night of Oct. 20, the bank succeeded in programming its system to capture cards with the recognizable flaw rather than honor and return them. On the morning of the 21st, bank officials retrieved two captured cards -- concrete evidence at last that a crime was being committed -- and immediately set up surveillance units at various locations they thought the culprit might visit. Whenever a card bearing the flaw was inserted in a machine, they would be alerted to the location and could follow the transaction on a computer screen. This time, instead of capturing cards, they would capture the thief.    At 8:16 that night, the Manufacturers Hanover computer showed that a card with the flaw was being used at a Chemical machine on Broadway at 81st Street. In fact, according to the arrest complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Post had just begun conducting a rapid series of five transactions at the machine, extracting a total of $900 from two separate accounts. Agents of Manufacturers Hanover arrived at the scene, but too late to tell who had made the withdrawals.    However, Mr. Post wasn't finished banking. He walked downtown to the Chemical branch at Columbus and 72nd, the complaint says, and at 8:41 started making his final withdrawals, of $200, $200 and $100. A bank agent pulled up during the transactions as officials monitoring the computer confirmed by cellular telephone that the man standing at the machine was using a fraudulent card. When the agent approached him, Mr. Post ran. He was captured two blocks away by police officers who happened to be passing by.    The wiry, soft-spoken Mr. Post, giving his name as Robert Lech (he also uses the name Robert Postawa), surrendered a simple set of weapons: 19 fraudulent ATM cards and a map of the city marked with ATM locations. He also had pocketfuls of cash-machine receipts for various accounts at Manufacturers Hanover, plus his night's withdrawals.    Mr. Post isn't penitent, contrasting himself favorably with someone who would mug a bank customer to steal a cash card but who might well escape all the fuss that Mr. Post ran into. &quot;If someone goes and steals the cards and puts them in {the machine}, it's nothing,&quot; he told this reporter. &quot;I told them, 'I'm a white-collar criminal.'&quot;    After the arrest, his attorney says, Mr. Post repaid Manufacturers Hanover about $50,000 that he had stored in a safe-deposit box.    Manufacturers Hanover says that, for security reasons, it can't discuss &quot;the systems of safeguards&quot; used to crack the Post case. But a spokesman notes that the bank itself uncovered the robberies, before the Secret Service was called in, and that no customers lost money. &quot;All customer accounts were credited within days of the incidents,&quot; he says. &quot;We do have every confidence the bank will recover all or the vast majority of the funds stolen.&quot;    Despite the $50,000 payback, Mr. Post spent three months at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan as defense lawyers and prosecutors tried to work out a plea agreement. In a letter Mr. Post sent to a U.S. magistrate who had presided over a detention hearing in November, he complained that although he &quot;surrendered voluntarily all kinds of evidence&quot; and briefed bank officials on some of his techniques, he was rebuffed by the banks and was made &quot;very paranoid&quot; by the justice system.    He said in the interview later that he was dismayed bank officials didn't offer him a consulting job. </TEXT></DOC>
