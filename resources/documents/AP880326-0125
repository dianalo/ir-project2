Wecan, I am certain, become the leaders of the Congress of tomorrow.''   House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois, who spoke thewords, isn't Moses, and the laser show at the Johnson Space Centerdoesn't equal lightning on Mount Sinai. But Republicans are longingto enter the promised land of congressional control. They came to aconference in Houston to find the key.   About 70 GOP lawmakers visited the space center, the TexasMedical Center, and institutes of higher learning that have madeHouston a technological haven. After years of being the complainersand nay-sayers on Capitol Hill, they are searching for somethingthey can champion and capture the imagination of the Americanpublic.   ``You don't get votes by just saying the Democrats are mean tous,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who heads a committee workingto overcome the Democrats' 255-177 advantage and win the House backto the GOP.   Like the desert-wandering Israelites of old, the Republicanshave seen an entire generation move on during their exile frompower. Not a single current GOP member was serving the last timethe speaker of the House was a Republican 34 years ago.   With their three-day ``Congress of Tomorrow'' conference, whichended Saturday, House Republicans launched a campaign to becomeknown as the party of the future.   Public investments in technology and education were the themesof the weekend, including meetings with businessman H. Ross Perot,supercomputer scientist Paul Chu, heart surgeon Michael DeBakey,and workers at an oil refinery.   Secretary of Education William Bennett urged Republicans to takethe issue of quality education away from the Democrats.   ``Americans are really quite Republican and conservative when itcomes to education,'' he said, alluding to the back-to-basicsmovement in the schools.   Rep. Jack Buechner of Missouri, the only Republican to unseat anincumbent House Democrat two years ago, said he was working toconvince fellow Republicans and Vice President George Bush,accepted here as the obvious nominee of the party, that a strongspace and science plank was needed in the party platform.   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., enthusiastically pointed out that atthe same time the Republicans were exploring 21st century ideashere, Democratic presidential candidates were campaigning inMichigan with a promise of trade protectionism for industrialtechnologies of the past.   But as much as they wanted to look toward the future, theRepublicans found in Houston a healthy dose of the present.   Instead of the expected address on his latest heart-surgerybreakthroughs, Dr. DeBakey gave the lawmakers a lecture on the needfor stray dogs and cats in medical research and asked them tooppose animal rights legislation.   Michel's keynote address at the space center rapped what hecalled backward looking Democrats and trade protectionists. Sonytelevision cameras taped the speech and when lawmakers went laterto buy ``NASA'' lapel pins, they said ``made in Canada'' on theback.   The city's oil-bust economy could be viewed only a short walkfrom the plush conference hotel.   Entire neighborhoods seemed nearly vacant, with many housesboarded up and dilapidated. As the police-escorted bus motorcaderoared to one of the events, one man held out his upturned hat asthough begging for money.   A planned outing Saturday to the new Wortham performing artscenter had to be canceled when police found what they thought was abomb. It was later discovered the device was harmless.   Houston Special Operations Sgt. John Scroggins described theobject as a pipe about five or six inches long, two inches indiameter, that had caps on both ends.   A party was held Friday night at the El Mercado Del Sol, a mallcreated to help the Hispanic community but which has been mostlyempty and financially troubled.   Privately, it was conceded that one Republican leader hadquestioned whether Houston was the symbol they were seeking. Theorganizers of the event, which was paid for largely by corporatesponsors, were clearly disappointed that less than half the HouseRepublicans attended.   Even the most optimistic lawmakers said it was unlikely the GOPcould take over the House before 1992, when a post-censusredistricting could throw many seats their way if the partysucceeds in gaining control of key state legislatures.   The plight was illustrated by the two fundraisers held duringthe weekend _ for Republicans bailing out of the House to seek theSenate.   Rep. Beau Boulter's quest to unseat Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,is a long shot. And Rep. Trent Lott's campaign for the Mississippislot held by Sen. John Stennis, the senior Democrat who isretiring, is even more indicative of the House Republicans' moraletroubles.   Lott, 46, is the Republican Whip, which means he would havebecome party leader after Michel decides to step down. Lott saidhis decision to run for the Senate was mostly because of theopportunity afforded by Stennis' retirement and personal reasons.   But, he condeded, his decision might have been different.   ``If I thought that we had the prospect of having a majority (inthe House) next year or in four years, certainly that would be afactor,'' he said.   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said he was optimistic but realistic.``you win these things one step at a time,'' he said. ``We'reready. The question is when.''   All the Republicans were hoping they wouldn't have to be aspatient as indicated by the laser computer-generated image of JamesMadison that spoke to them at the space center.   ``God speed to you, founding fathers of the 21st century,'' itsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
