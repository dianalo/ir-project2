(800) 446-6393; (901) 683-3383.andP;  Version: 1.12andM;Requires: System 4.1 or later.andM;Compatibility: Mac 512KE or later.andM;Application Size: DAtabase Builder, 105K; DAtabase Converter, 101K; DAtabaseDA, 138K.andP;  Copy Protection: NoneandM;The first thing you'll think when you use DAtabase is why didn't anyone dothis before?andP;  A flat-File manager that is always available on the Apple menuis just too good an idea to have taken so long to appear.andP;  Why no one thoughtof it before is a mystery, but it's here now, and it's a winner.andM;DAtabase is a collection of programs.andP;  The centerpiece is, of course, the DAitself, which lets you browse, search, and update databases at any time.andO;DAtabase Builder is the application that you use to design and lay outdatabases, define and name fields, and so forth.andP;  DAtabase Converter, anotherapplication, helps you move existing data into new databases.andP;  Converter canprocess text files (you can define the delimiters), so you can import datafrom other database programs.andP;  It also handles pictures as Scrapbook orPictureBase files and can be used to merger DAtabase files or import QuickDexfiles.andP;  DAtabase Utility is a HyperCard stack that exports data fromHyperCard into a text format that DAtabase Converter can handle.andM;DAtabase databases don't have to be simplistic or small.andP;  DAtabase supportscolor graphics as backgrounds and fields.andP;  Besides graphic and text fields,DAtabase supports check-box (on or off), pop-up-list, and calculated fields.andO;A DAtabase file can contain 2,500 records with 50 items (fields and/orlabels) per record.andM;If you need another feature, DAtabase lets you add it through the Xtrafeature mechanism.andP;  Xtra features are special programs, such as a phonedialer, a paint or text grabber, or a calendar (these and many others aresupplied), that can be added to a DAtabase file.andP;  Programmers can write theirown Xtra features.andP;  DAtabase also comes with an application, FKEY to Xtra,which translates function keys into Xtra features.andM;Using DAtabase is easy.andP;  Start by using DAtabase Builder to design adatabase.andP;  DAtabase comes with example databases that you can examine forideas, and if you want to copy a layout, just do a Save As; DAtabase Builderwill reproduce the layout but not the data.andP;  Builder has a tool palette thathelps you do your layout work, or you can use Command keys or the menu items,which correspond to the tools.andP;  As you lay out the fields, you can specifythe font, size, style, color, and justification of each field.andP;  Each fieldcan have a specified border, background pattern, and color.andP;  When you'vefinished the layout, you can control the tabbing order of the fields.andP;  Oncethe database is built, you can enter data or import it, using DAtabaseConverter.andM;Now you're ready to use the DAtabase DA.andP;  When you open DAtabase, you see theDAtabase MiniFinder.andP;  This window operates much like HyperCard's Home card;you can install up to five pages of nine DAtabase file icons each, andDAtabase will remember where the files are.andP;  You can also set one file asyour auto-open file; whenever you open DAtabase, that file automaticallyopens.andM;When you select a DAtabase file, you open the DAtabase program.andP;  LikeDAtabase Builder, DAtabase has a tool palette that duplicates many of theitems from the DAtabase menu.andP;  By clicking on the tool icons, you can open aview-by-list window, add a record to the end of the file, delete a record,search the database, sort the file, print selected records, go to a specificrecord, or mark and unmark records.andM;DAtabase has many features you don't expected to find in a DA.andP;  It sorts onup to three fields, in ascending or descending order.andP;  The searchingcapability lets you search on a single field or on all fields, using standardcomparisons.andP;  Marking records is another powerful feature.andP;  Searches can markrecords, or you can mark and unmark records manually.andP;  Once a number ofrecords have been marked, they can be searched, printed, or exportedseparately.andM;DAtabase can print records either as a list or as &quot;cards&quot; (records as theyappear on-screen).andP;  DAtabase determines the page size (allowing for anyenlargement or reduction) and calculates how many records wil fit on a page.andO;When printing a list, DAtabase prompts you for the fields you want to printif they will not fit on a page.andM;DAtabase's sole weakness is its documentation.andP;  The manual spends so muchspace in a good but superfluous introduction on how to use a Macintosh and amouse that it omits important information, such as the fact that you need tomove the Help file into your System folder if you want to avoid hanging yourmachine when you invoke Help.andP;  The tutorial HyperCard stack is no help atall, since it presumes you can read only two words a minute and forces you towait so long to get any information that you're better off just experimentingon your own.andM;DAtabase is an outstanding program and a good value.andP;  It compares well withstand-alone file managers such as MicrosoftFile and FileMaker II.andP;  If you'vebeen looking for a file mnager, a good phone book, a clip-art inventory, anda weekly calendar, take a look at DAtabase.andP;  It may be exactly what you'vebeen looking for--and in a DA to boot.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
