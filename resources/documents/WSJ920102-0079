Investment bankers see few signs of anupturn this year.   Instead of risking billions on acquisitions priced at apremium to the soaring stock market, many corporationsconcentrated on shoring up their financial condition as theeconomy ducked in and out of recession. Or they hedged theirbets by negotiating joint ventures or partial equity stakeswith strategic partners instead of outright mergers.</LP><TEXT>   The volume of announced takeover bids and mergersworld-wide fell 40% to $303.68 billion in 1991, according toa preliminary tally through Dec. 27 by Securities Data Co.Announced deals involving U.S. acquisitions fell 34% to$142.3 billion -- a level 73% below the peak year of 1988.   Felix Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres andamp; Co.,says he has been advising clients considering acquisitions towait because he thinks the stock market doesn't fully reflectthe weakness in the economy. &quot;Despite the apparent optimismreflected in the recent stock market surge,&quot; he says, 1992activity &quot;will be down substantially.&quot;   Some bankers are less pessimistic. Mike Overlock, head ofmergers at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., believes the robust stockmarket will prompt more companies to use equity to financeacquisitions, and that a pickup in the economy will producemore &quot;momentum&quot; in the merger business in the spring.   One of the biggest obstacles to big takeovers was thereluctance of banks, under pressure from regulators toimprove their loan portfolios, to make aggressive new loansfor mergers or buy-outs. Many banks were weakened by makingtoo many ill-advised loans in the late 1980s for leveragedacquisitions, real estate, and other speculative ventures.   Indeed, a need for consolidation among major bankscontributed to one of the biggest flurries of U.S. deals whenthree bank mega-mergers were announced in two months atmidyear: NCNB Corp. acquiring Candamp;S/Sovran Corp. for $4.26billion; BankAmerica Corp. buying Security Pacific Corp. for$4.21 billion; and Chemical Bank Corp. purchasingManufacturers Hanover Corp. for $2.3 billion.   Another flurry of deals took place in Britain, where stockprices have been hammered by high interest rates. In onefive-week period in the autumn, three companies, HawkerSiddeley Group PLC, Ultramar PLC and Beazer PLC, got bidsvalued at $2 billion or more.   In computers and telecommunications, changing regulations,markets and technology drove another spate of U.S. deals. The$7.9 billion acquisition of NCR Corp. by American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. led the pack, followed by GTE Corp.'s $6.24billion merger with Contel Corp.   However, lawyers and investment bankers who had expected awave of hostile bids like ATandamp;T's, twinned with proxy fightsto break down the target's takeover defenses, weredisappointed. The only other example was the successful $2.17billion takeover bid for Square D by the French firmSchneider S.A.   Indeed, corporate raiders who had been threatening proxyfights bailed out of positions in several companies. CarlIcahn sold a stake in USX Corp., Harold Simmons retreatedfrom a challenge against Lockheed Corp., and the team ofGordon Getty and the Fisher brothers real estate familyunloaded their shares in Avon Corp.   Generically, two of the biggest types of acquisitions inthe late 1980s -- leveraged buy-outs and purchases byJapanese buyers -- have shrunk roughly 90%. The lack of bankfinancing is holding back LBOs. Japanese buyers haveretreated after paying huge prices for such trophy U.S.properties as Columbia Pictures, Rockefeller Center and thePebble Beach golf course.   Would-be acquirers were picking over the slag pile ofcompanies that got into debt trouble in the late 1980s. Somevultures engineered such acquisitions, but usually only aftertortuous negotiations. General Cinema Corp. walked away fromone offer before finally landing Harcourt Brace JovanovichInc.; the Zell-Chilmark vulture fund spent a year prospectingbefore making a successful bid for Carter Hawley Hale StoresInc. One troubled drug chain, Revco D.S., even attracted twocompeting suitors.   Other companies being put on the block are state-ownedfirms in countries around the world hungry for capital andeconomic development. Mexico has sold stakes in its nationalbank and telephone company and several nations have soldairlines and utilities.   Still, one New York investment banker says &quot;basicindustrial activity is off dramatically. Fortune 500companies are focused internally on pruning and cost-cutting.Many have pulled in their horns because of their feelingabout the economy.&quot;   Many companies tried to achieve their strategic goals vialinks with other companies that involved hefty cashtransfers. Time Warner sold a stake in an entertainmentsubsidiary to two Japanese concerns for $1 billion to try tocut debt and gain access to the Japanese market. AndMcDonnell Douglas Corp. agreed to sell a 40% stake to aTaiwanese company for $2 billion to obtain capital.   &quot;We've seen a lot of non-traditional joint ventures andstrategic stakes. Maybe it means we've got a kinder, gentlermerger market,&quot; says Philip Keevil, head of investmentbanking at the New York office of S.G. Warburg andamp; Co.   Many investment bankers seem resigned that the doldrumswill continue. Says Scott Levine, head of mergers andacquisitions at J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., &quot;I can't see what changesthere are on the horizon that are going to accelerate thepace of the business.&quot;   But others do see enough changes to make a difference.Barry Friedberg, head of investment banking at Merrill Lynchandamp; Co., says &quot;the dramatic improvement in the high-yield bondmarket, and the steady improvement in the condition of thebanking system over recent months&quot; should help to financeacquisitions. He adds, &quot;I'd say 1992 will be a better yeargenerally.&quot;   ---            The Biggest Deals Completed in 1991                                                                                                          Value of deals includes assumption or refinancing of debt                                                                                                        Buyer           Acquisition      Transaction      Value                                     Type      (in billions)                                                                                                        Kyowa Bank      Saitama Bank       Merger         $8.09 ATandamp;T Co.
