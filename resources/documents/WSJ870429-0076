Scherer to ReportProfit for Fiscal 1987After Year-Ago Loss</HL><DD> 04/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SCHCDOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO) </IN><DATELINE> TROY, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   R.P. Scherer Corp. expects to report record sales and possibly record earnings for the year ended March 31, compared with a net loss the previous year.    Sales for the year increased &quot;a little better&quot; than 20% from a record $185.8 million in fiscal 1986, Scherer said. Sales for the nine months ended Dec. 31 grew 20%, to $165.5 million, from a year earlier.    Scherer makes gelatin capsules for the drug and vitamin industries.    The company said one analyst's forecast that net income will total about 95 cents a share for the entire year &quot;looks pretty accurate.&quot; Final results should be released in early May.    While 95 cents a share could translate into record net on a dollar basis, it wouldn't necessarily be a per-share record because the number of Scherer shares outstanding has grown. In 1981, the previous year for record earnings, Scherer reported net of $8.5 million, or $1.11 a share, with an average 7.6 million shares outstanding. As of Dec. 31, the company had about 9.4 million shares outstanding.    Still, the estimate for fiscal 1987 would represent a significant turnaround from net losses of $10.6 million in fiscal 1986 and $2.6 million in fiscal 1985. Those losses stemmed from charges taken when the company decided to restructure domestic manufacturing operations and phase out U.S. production of hardshell gelatin capsules. Scherer still makes hard-shell capsules overseas.    Peter R. Fink, president and chief executive officer, said in an interview that Scherer is targeting per-share earnings growth of 12% to 15% a year &quot;for the foreseeable future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
