The cooling system consists of: a coolant pump having a pump shaftarranged parallel to the crankshaft, within the V spaced from the junction,and spaced from the cylinders vertically in axial direction of the crankshaft;the coolant pump being joined to a first face of the bottom wall of thecrankcase and having outlet passages extending orthogonal to the crankshaftand ending at the first face of the bottom wall, separate cooling jacketsmounted at the cylinders and having therein separate inlets at a secondface of the bottom wall of the crankcase, and intermediate coolant passagesprovided within the bottom wall between the first and second faces andjoining the outlet passages to the inlets of the cooling jackets.</TEXT></DOC>
