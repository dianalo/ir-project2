ScheierandM;COMPANY: Coast Federal BankandM;APPLICATION: PayrollandM;RESULTS: Lower cost, improved access to data, higher quality bulletins andreports.andM;----------Dollar signs loomed large when Coast Federal Bank moved a payroll applicationfrom an IBM mainframe to a Novell LAN.andM;&quot;Management said, 'We've got a few million dollars sitting over here, and wedon't have one application [running] yet -- throw it out,&quot; said EDP AuditManager Mark Stanley.andM;The &quot;it&quot; was an IBM 4381 and a Management Science America Inc. (MSA) payrollpackage that cost more than $100,000.andP;  &quot;That's not counting terminals, notcounting CICS, VTAM, MVS or the lease of the hardware,&quot; he said.andM;Nor did it count the annual maintenance fee on the MSA software.andM;Then, for between $50,000 and $80,000, the bank installed a 30-node NovellLAN plus a payroll application from Bank of America, as well as the staff tosupport it.andM;&quot;Where before we were arguing over who would get a terminal,&quot; said Stanley,every user now has a diskless PC that provides instant access to data.andM;Along with savings, he said the quality &quot;coming out of the department hasimproved tremendously.&quot;andM;The ease with which users can access data goes hand in hand with the savings,he said.andP;  &quot;Cost is driving it, and we want access to the data.&quot;andP;  -- R.L.S.andM;COMPANY: Keystone Group Inc.andM;APPLICATION: Portfolio analysis.andM;RESULTS: Analysts have more complete and up-to-date data to track portfolioholdings.andM;----------The Keystone Group Inc., a Boston-based mutual fund company, is a perfectexample of what downsizing is all about.andM;Analysts and portfolio managers get more information, more quickly, fromtheir PC/LAN than they could from a minicomputer or mainframe.andM;It has nothing to do with cost, said Vice President and Quantitative AnalystWilliam Parsons.andP;  &quot;You just can't do it any other way.&quot;andM;Every night, up-to-the-minute data from Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  VAXes issifted into hundreds of spreadsheets that are then downloaded to five NovellNetWare LANs to which the analysts' PCs are linked.andM;&quot;I can't think of any application I wouldn't rather write on a LAN,&quot; saidParsons.andP;  &quot;It's easier to program, it's easier to make it run, it's easier toback it up, it's easier to document it.&quot;andM;The firm's portfolios have performed better since the LANs were installed.andM;The LANs may not be the reason, he said, &quot;but they [the analysts] certainlyhave an easier time getting at this information.andM;&quot;You can't get user productivity until you give the user control of themachine,&quot; added Parsons.andP;  &quot;You can't put a programmer between an analyst andhis data.andP;  It just doesn't work.&quot; -- R.L.S.andM;COMPANY: Major grocery-products manufacturer.andM;APPLICATIONS: Budget analysis and forecasting.andM;RESULTS: Managers use data from LANs to cut costs and increase ef ficiency.andM;----------When a major grocery-products company in the Midwest moved much of its budgetanalysis to LANs, the primary incentive was to save money.andM;And save it did: $25,000 in the first year, for a group of users in theemployee-benefits department, according to a micro manager who asked thatneither he nor his firm be identified.andM;But like many other companies surveyed by PC Week, the company found that thereal benefit of downsizing was that managers could do a better job.andM;Previously, computer operators and clerks would have to be brought in, atovertime rates, to enter data at nights and on weekends on the IBM 3090mainframe.andP;  Then managers would come in, often at night or on weekends, toanalyze the data.andM;Now managers can input data and analyze it when they want -- even from home.andM;Most important, those managers do a better job of analyzing the data.andM;&quot;Before, it was just 'Hurry up and get [the data] in,' &quot; the micro managersaid.andP;  &quot;[Now] they're spending the same amount of time as before, but they'redoing much more in the way of analysis.&quot; -- R.L.S.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
