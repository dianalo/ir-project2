(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jon PepperandM;Connectivity has taken on new dimensions as Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintoshcontinues to gain popularity in the corporate world.andP;  Where connectivity wasonce primarily an IBM PC-to-mainframe or a PC-to-PC issue, the Mac hasexpanded the communications demands to include transparent connectivitybetween PCs and Macs.andM;For corporate buyers, a number of alternatives are available for Mac-to-PCfile transfer.andP;  The three main transfer methods currently favored bybusinesses are transfers via direct-link products, network hookups andmodems.andM;Despite the trend toward corporate networking, manufacturers of Mac-to-PCfile-transfer products claim that direct-link transfer methods are still themost popular.andP;  DataViz Inc.'s sales leader is its direct-link product,MacLink Plus/PC, according to Dick Fontana, president of the Trumbull, Conn.,andO;developer.andM;&quot;You would think that networks had taken over the world,&quot; said Fontana, &quot;butwe sell our product with or without the link cable in the box, and the onewith the cable [the direct-link product] is outselling the version withoutthe cable by 10-to-1.&quot;andM;Fontana interpreted this preference for direct-link products as a signal thatfirst-time users of Mac-to-PC file transfer generally have a specific projectto accomplish.andP;  &quot;For example, maybe they just bought a Mac and don't want toconnect it to a file server, but just want to put a simple link in place totransfer files,&quot; Fontana said.andP;  A direct link can be the simplest way toachieve such a limited goal.andM;Many corporate buyers and users remain convinced, however, that networksprovide the best way to transfer files between PCs and Macs.andM;For Price Collins, a program manager with General Electric Corp. inBridgeport, Conn., the AppleTalk network technology works for PCs as well asMacs.andP;  Before switching to AppleTalk, General Electric had been usingDataViz's MacLink product.andM;With the new system, said Collins, &quot;We've moved everything to the network andhave no problems at all exchanging files between PCs, Macs and Wangproducts.&quot;andM;Although GE users still work with the DataViz translators, they no longerhave to deal with either direct-link or modem hookups.andP;  According to Collins,&quot;It's almost a truism that once you're on a network, you don't need to stringspecial-purpose lines between machines.&quot;andM;If a network doesn't offer adequate support for file transfer betweendissimilar machines, Collins added, it isn't accomplishing its intendedpurpose.andM;Users, meanwhile, have begun to explore other Mac-to-PC file-transferoptions.andP;  The SuperDrive introduced on newer models of the Macintosh supports3-1/2-inch DOS-format disks and has been a deciding factor for some Macusers.andP;  &quot;Suddenly, customers can [carry disks from one machine to another]and then simply use the translators in [MacLink] to convert files,&quot; saidDataViz's Fontana.andM;Translators are file filters that convert one Mac or PC file format to adifferent one, so that files can be used with formatting attributes intact onthe target machine.andP;  The translated files retain their word-processingformats, spreadsheet formulas, and even graphics in some cases.andM;The DataViz translators are designed to be easy to use in order toaccommodate less technically adept users.andP;  &quot;As more desks get populated withPCs, you go lower and lower on the technical literacy scale, and it'simportant that users shouldn't have to do anything complicated to transferand translate files,&quot; explained Fontana.andM;At General Electric Aerospace, in Burlington, Mass., PC coordinator JoelRichmond has already tried several methods of fulfilling the company'sPC-to-Mac file-transfer and -translation requirements.andP;  Richmond overseesabout 400 PCs and 250 Macs that are used for spreadsheets, databases, costanalysis, word processing and engineering design.andM;Richmond tried the public-domain communications product ProComm to handletransfer needs via a modem.andP;  ProComm was called up on the PC, and the Macuser would dial in to make the connection.andP;  The method worked well for ASCII,Lotus and Excel files.andP;  The problem, according to Richmond, was that &quot;youneeded one person at each end who knew what they were doing, and, from asupport standpoint, it was a pain in the neck.&quot;andM;Richmond finally settled on the Copy2 Board from Central Point Software Inc.andO;of Portland, Ore.andP;  This hardware solution allows a 3-1/2-inch drive in a PCto read and write to Mac disks.andP;  Richmond uses a 360K-byte, 5-1/4-inch floppydrive to handle the PC disks.andP;  Converting from one format to the other is assimple as performing a copy operation from one drive to another, he said.andM;&quot;We found that it transparently copies from Mac to IBM format and back, andit has been an excellent solution for us,&quot; said Richmond.andM;He rejected direct-link products for several reasons.andP;  One problem, he said,is that they require the Mac and the PC to be physically near each other orelse hooked up via a network.andM;&quot;Direct-link transfer methods tie up two machines, while [the Copy2 Board]just sits in a single machine,&quot; Richmond said.andP;  He was also impressed withthe simplicity of the process and the low price of the Copy2 Board, whichcosts approximately $120 at discount.andM;&quot;It's cheap, it did what it was advertised to do, and it worked right off thebat,&quot; he said.andM;----------Jon Pepper, a frequent contributor to PC Week, lives in westernMassachusetts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
