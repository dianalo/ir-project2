Aortasfrom normal chow-fed rabbits did not exhibit significant 125I-Cl accumulation.When cholesterol-fed rabbits were intravenously administered Tween-solubilized125I-Cl and simultaneously treated with either of two anti-atherogeniccompounds, estradiol 17{beta}-cypionate or colestipol, the extent ofaortic atherosclerosis was found to dramatically decrease. Measurementof aortic radioactivity was found to strongly correlate with the severityof atherosclerosis. Although the specificity of 125I-Cl for atheromatouslesions was very good, gamma-camera scintigraphy of the abdomens of theserabbits 6 days after cessation of 125I-Cl administration was not ableto consistently predict the severity of atherosclerosis. Tissue distributionstudies suggested that high blood and spinal column bone marrow radioactivityproduced aorta:nontarget radioactivity ratios unfavorable with respectto imaging. To improve this ratio so as to permit noninvasive imaging,attempts were made to incorporate 125I-Cl into serum lipoproteins. Labellingof either rabbit LDL by in vivo incorporation or human LDL by transferof 125I-Cl from liposomes using cholesteryl ester transfer protein resultedin lipoproteins with low specific activity. Higher specific activitywas achieved by reconstituting delipidated human LDL with a mixture of125I-Cl and unlabeled cholesteryl oleate. These particles were takenup in high amounts by monolayers of human fibroblasts but not by fibroblastsdeficient in LDL receptors or by normal fibroblasts during competitionwith unlabeled native LDL.</TEXT></DOC>
