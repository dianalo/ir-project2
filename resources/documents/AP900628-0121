(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Raging wildfires set by arsonistsburned more than 300 homes in Southern California as wind-drivenflames left over 14,000 acres of parched brush blackened today.   Forty-six firefighters were injured working fire linesthroughout the region, including two prison inmates criticallyburned in Riverside County.   A 3,500-acre blaze destroyed 280 homes in Santa Barbara Countylate Wednesday and continued to burn today in a canyon north ofSanta Barbara.   Homeowners in this coastal community today surveyed charred lotswhere flames torched rows of expensive homes but skipped throughthe air to spare others. One serious injury was reported.   ``It was a beautiful neighborhood,'' Eric Lim said as theremains of his house smoldered behind him.   ``I can't find anything, there's nothing,'' Nancy Harvey said,her hands picking through what was once the kitchen of her dreamhome. ``I'm hoping to find my address book.''   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. Itspread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said TimGrasey, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.   From Santa Barbara to San Diego, thousands of people wererousted from homes.   Santa Barbara residents alerted by smoke, neighbors and rovingU.S. Forest Service crews packed what they could and fled in carsor on foot.   ``The trees were lighting up like torches,'' said resident DaveWilliams, who was just watching the fire until he realized that``this is serious business. I could die in this stuff.''   The fires were worsened by four years of drought and a searingheat wave that pushed temperatures to record levels well above 100degrees. Water reserves were at their lowest levels in years.   Hot desert winds up to 60 mph fanned the Santa Barbara fireWednesday, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Susan Mockenhaupt said.   Dropping temperatures and winds tamed the fire overnight,leaving only isolated hot spots. But fire officials refused todeclare it contained today, saying they feared winds could fan theflames again.   In one subdivision, every home was gutted, every street alandscape of chimneys and charred kitchen appliances. Occasionally,a geyser of flame shot from a gas main, giving the scene a hellishlook. Workers rushed to shut off gas lines.   The fire also destroyed businesses and a school for handicappedadults, set a fire station ablaze and prompted evacuation of thecounty jail. It shut down traffic on U.S. Highway 101 and cut offrail service.   Authorities blamed arson, saying they found an incendiarydevice. Ashes filled the sky more than 35 miles from the blaze.   In Arizona, meanwhile, fire burned out of control today in TontoNational Forest, where six firefighters were killed Tuesday. InMontrose, Colo., a lightning-sparked fire in the ponderosa burnedat least 1,000 acres.   Santa Barbara County's blaze was its first of that magnitudesince a 1977 fire burned 234 homes in the area, which is on thePacific Coast 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Its propertyvalues were among the state's highest.   ``It looks like a war zone out there,'' Grasey said.``Everything is blackened. It's just total devastation. You neverfelt more helpless. You look at it and there's nothing you could doto stop it.''   Brenda Rein watched from a shopping mall as the fire marcheddown a mountain.   ``The whole sky was just orange. I looked up and saw the moonthrough the smoke, kind of a werewolf moon,'' she said.   Barbara Jefferson of Santa Barbara came out of a movie theaterto find the evening sky raining soot and the wind blowing sofiercely it was hard to stand. In the distant hills, she said, ``wejust saw mountains of flames.''   Police in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale today said theywere seeking two people for questioning in connection with adeliberately set fire that destroyed or damaged 55 homes thereWednesday. The homes were valued at $300,000 to $700,000 each, andproperty losses were estimated at $30 million.   ``The California chaparral over here, all that sage and scruboak, is literally like gasoline,'' Fire Battalion Chief Chris Graysaid.   Meanwhile, 60 miles to the east of Los Angeles, a fire near thesmall community of El Cerrito in Riverside County destroyed 12homes and closed Interstate 15.   Nine firefighters were injured, mostly from heat exhaustion andsmoke inhalation, officials said. An estimated 2,000 firefighterswere trying today to contain the fire at 2,200 acres.   The blaze began after a U.S. Forest Service ``controlled burn''_ an attempt to burn away brush to prevent fires _ raged out ofcontrol.   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area of Orange County spreadover 6,640 acres to the San Bernardino County community of SleepyHollow, where eight homes were engulfed. Eight firefighterssuffered minor injuries, authorities said.   Sleepy Hollow's 2,000 residents fled, said LoVae Pray Martines,a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry.   Peter Reyes, 29, was arrested for investigation of arson, saidMaria Sabol, a spokeswoman for Orange County Fire Department.   A 150-acre fire near Hemet, another Riverside County community,injured 17 firefighters. Two inmates working firelines werecritically burned, officials said. In the Moreno Valley area of thecounty, fire destroyed three homes.   In Arizona, the Tonto National Forest fire scorched more than21,000 acres, forest spokesman Ken Palmrose said. Lightning startedthe fire Monday. The fire has destroyed at least 50 homes andthreatened about 700 more, officials said.   Firefighters were unable to save a cabin built in the 1920s byZane Grey, a prolific Western novelist who drew on the picturesque,pine-shaded Tonto Rim country for inspiration.   Forest spokesman Bob Celaya said authorities still were tryingto learn how five inmates and a prison employee were killed Tuesdaywhile battling the fire.   The victims were among several crews who were trapped when a``dry thunderstorm'' struck the area, spreading the fire in alldirections.</TEXT></DOC>
