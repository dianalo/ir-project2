Secord, in anindictment unsealed today, was charged with lying during the 1987congressional Iran-Contra hearings by denying he profited from theU.S.-Iran arms sales.   The nine-count indictment accused Secord of giving falsetestimony to the special House and Senate committees thatinvestigated the U.S.-Iran arms deals and the diversion of profitsfrom them to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The indictment charged that Secord lied when he told the jointhearings that he ``foreswore'' any profits from the dummycorporations he operated with his former business partner, AlbertHakim.   ``I foreswore them and left to Mr. Hakim to do with it as hewished,'' Secord said in a statement Iran-Contra prosecutorscharged was false.   The indictment charged that Secord lied when he said he gave aSwiss-based attorney only $400,000 of his money to manage. In fact,it said   when, in fact, he used the lawyer ``on a continuous basis tomanage over a million dollars of profits allocated'' to Secord.   A retired Air Force major general, Secord is already charged,along with Hakim and former national security adviser JohnPoindexter, with participating in the Iran-Contra conspiracy.   He was the lead witness in the televised hearings conducted inthe spring and summer of 1987 by the House and Senate committees.Secord testified without limited immunity from prosecution beforethe congressional panels.   The latest indictment was returned by a federal grand jury onApril 7 but was kept under seal until the end of the trial offormer White House aide Oliver North.   North was convicted last week of three felony counts butacquitted of nine others stemming from his role in the Iran-Contraaffair.   In a statement, Secord's lawyers called the indictment ``a clearexample of complete abdication of prosecutorial discretion.''   The second indictment makes it ``painfully obvious that theprosecutor's office is fearful that what little is left of itsoriginal case against General Secord can no longer withstand attackin the courtroom.''   The new charges show that the independent counsel ``intends togo to extraordinary lengths to find some charge, howeverimmaterial, for which General Secord can be prosecuted,'' saiddefense lawyers Thomas C. Green, James E. Sharp and V. ThomasLankford Jr.   As the indictment was unsealed today, Secord was convicted in asuburban Virginia court of driving while intoxicated.   Fairfax County District Judge Barbara Kimble gave Secord asuspended 30-day jail sentence and ordered him to pay a $500 fine,of which $300 was suspended, said deputy prosecutor Ray Morrow.   Secord's driver's license was suspended for six months, but hewas allowed to drive between his home, work and an alcoholismrehabilitation center, Morrow said.   The federal indictment charged that Secord ``endeavored toimpede the select committees from learning the true facts about thefinances of the enterprise and his relationship to those financesby providing false, evasive and misleading evidence'' while underoath.   The indictment, ordered unsealed by U.S. District Judge AubreyE. Robinson Jr., charged that Secord ``willfully and knowingly''obstructed the investigation by the congressional committees intohis role as a middleman in the U.S.-Iran arms deals.   It said, among other things, that Secord lied when he testifiedat the hearings that he had no interest in a company called KorelAssets Inc. even though he was a principal shareholder.   Secord, 56, is also accused of lying by stating that he did notshare in the profits of the Iran-Contra ``enterprise,'' even thoughhe earned profits from the operation.   Each charge upon conviction carries a maximum sentence of fiveyears' imprisonment and $250,000 in fines.   Secord is lso charged with lying the committees' staff bydenying that any of the proceeds went to North.   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh told reporters that thecharge relates to alleged lies about ``the $200,000 fund'' forNorth's family in the event he failed to return from a trip to Iranand about North's acceptance of a $13,800 home security system.   The count accused Secord of denying to lawyers for thecongressional Iran-Contra panels that he was aware of any moneyfrom the enterprise that went to benefit North.   North was convicted last week of accepting an illegal gratuitywhen he allowed Secord to install the security system outside hishome in Great Falls, Va.   Secord and Hakim are already charged with conspiring to pay anillegal gratuity to North.</TEXT></DOC>
