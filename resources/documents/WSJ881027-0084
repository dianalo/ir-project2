Mainstream Democrats believe that their only chance of recapturing the White House four years hence is to push the party toward the middle of the national political spectrum.    But to do it, once again they will have to stop Jesse Jackson.    &quot;You're going to have another version of the stop-Jackson movement very early,&quot; says Ronald Walters, a Howard University political scientist and a Jackson issues strategist. &quot;Because if they don't do it then, it may be too late to stop Jackson by the time the {next} campaign rolls around.&quot;    If the Democrats lose, as expected, they will face the most bitter internal battle since the Vietnam War and the heyday of segregationist Gov. George Wallace of Alabama a generation ago. The presidential ambitions of Mr. Jackson, the fiery black preacher from Chicago, are the catalyst for the split.    For their part, many blacks are angry at the party for what they feel is a lack of respect shown to Mr. Jackson. &quot;We've been shafted enough as a people, supporting a particular party because it is that party,&quot; complains Anita Atiba, a mother of four in Savannah, Ga. Tony Riley, a city worker in Savannah, says only Mr. Jackson addresses issues that are most important to the black community, &quot;the homeless and the hungry, the shut-in and the shut-out.&quot;    For some rank-and-file white Democrats, racial considerations dominate their views of Mr. Jackson. If he &quot;were ever elected, black people are going to expect so much from him,&quot; says Richard Albrecht, a deputy sheriff in New York City's Queens borough. &quot;If he doesn't give them what they want, we'll have a riot. It's all a racial question.&quot; Says Steven Geier, a laborer in Canton, Ohio: &quot;He's too much of a racist for me. He's changed his tactics a little bit in this campaign, but in the last campaign everything he talked about was race.&quot;    Evidence of racial polarization among voters also surfaces in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken this month. Among probable white voters of both parties surveyed, 61% said they would not want Mr. Jackson to seek the presidency again. But 67% of black voters said they do want him to.    Even if Mr. Jackson were white, however, his politics still would offend middle-road and conservative Democrats. To their way of thinking, his ideology, expressed largely in his exhortations for government activism on behalf of the poor and minorities, constitutes a threat to the party's very survival. &quot;If Jesse Jackson takes over the Democratic party, the party as we know it may be destroyed, and on the national level the Republicans will dominate American politics,&quot; asserts Mark Siegel, a member of the Democratic National Committee. &quot;The issue is ideology, not race.&quot;    Says John Baker, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party: &quot;The Rev. Jackson has an agenda of his own that is far too liberal and will not be accepted by the American people.&quot;    A victory by Mr. Dukakis would, of course, secure his leadership of the party. But Mr. Jackson could probably claim the credit for the winner's strong black support, and he would retain an influential role. After being criticized by some Democrats for not being supportive enough of the ticket, Mr. Jackson has more clearly devoted his campaigning to helping Mr. Dukakis in recent days. He would expect a fair share of the victor's spoils, and he would expect from President Dukakis policies agreeable to his black and liberal constituencies.    But a Dukakis defeat now seems more probable. It would touch off a free-for-all for control of the party, erupting first at a meeting of Democratic state chairmen in Phoenix 10 days after the election. It would continue in February, when the chairman of the Democratic National Committee is to be chosen; some Democrats are already unhappy over signals that Ron Brown, a top Jackson aide who is working part-time for the Dukakis campaign, will seek the party's top post. Some are talking privately of persuading current party chairman Paul Kirk to stay on in order to avoid a blood bath over the choice of his successor.    Mr. Jackson himself declines to discuss the future. &quot;It is inappropriate for Democrats to give interviews in preparation for losing,&quot; he says.    Others, however, profess a clear view. &quot;I see the fight brewing between blacks and the party,&quot; says Linda Williams, a political scientist at the nonpartisan Joint Center of Political Studies in Washington, D.C. &quot;Truly, the Democrats and blacks are heading for a collision.&quot;    &quot;I think what is developing here is a contest for the future of the party,&quot; says Penn Kemble, an official of the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, a group of conservative Democrats.    At issue is the Democratic Party's fundamental direction. Mr. Jackson and others see its untapped strength in the masses of disaffected and disadvantaged citizens, many now unregistered, who had traditionally looked on the party to enhance their social and economic interests. This view calls for a return to the party's liberal roots and to government programs to deal with social and economic ills. &quot;I defend liberalism because I defend change for the better,&quot; Mr. Jackson recently told a group of Hollywood writers.    Many party professionals and others argue instead that the party must broaden its appeal to moderate and conservative Democrats, including those who defected to Ronald Reagan. &quot;We know we're not making it with the people who are voting now. We have to bring back the Reagan Democrats,&quot; says John Henry Anderson, Democratic Party chairman in Georgia. &quot;We know they do vote, so we need to get them back in the party.&quot;    By and large, these are not the voters whom Mr. Jackson is addressing now as he travels about the country. And the voters he does address often seem more excited about Mr. Jackson than they do about Mr. Dukakis.    In a recent seven days he appeared at more than 25 public events, most linked to voter-registration drives. He stirs excitement and attracts local media attention wherever he goes. At a speech at Savannah State College in Georgia, 2,000 people crammed into the predominantly black school's hot gymnasium. They roared as Mr. Jackson jabbed the Republican ticket. On cue, they repeated his pledge: &quot;To pull the Quayle from under the Bush and send both back to private life.&quot;    Bashing Mr. Bush, however, isn't quite the same as promoting Mr. Dukakis. Former Texas congresswoman Barbara Jordan, a co-chairwoman of the Dukakis campaign, recently accused Mr. Jackson of only &quot;grudgingly and reluctantly&quot; supporting Mr. Dukakis. &quot;Jesse Jackson never quite realized that he was defeated for the Democratic nomination and carried forward as if he were somehow a co-nominee,&quot; she complained. Since then, however, Ms. Jordan has changed her opinion. &quot;I would not make that statement today,&quot; she says. &quot;. . . we have seen Jesse Jackson working on behalf of the Democratic ticket.&quot;    Yet Mr. Jackson isn't necessarily able to transfer his own popularity among black voters to Mr. Dukakis. In Savannah, he shakes Ms. Atiba's hand in the doorway of her Frazier Homes housing project apartment and asks the mother of four to vote for the Massachusetts governor. But she declines. &quot;He's just too shaky and I would not vote for him,&quot; she says.    Some blacks who do say they will vote for Mr. Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen make it clear that their real hope is for another Jackson presidential bid. &quot;I am a Democrat. I'm going to vote for Dukakis-Bentsen,&quot; Marion Campbell, a 45-year-old industrial machinist says at a labor rally where Mr. Jackson spoke in Raeford, N.C. But Mr. Campbell is wearing a Dukakis/Bentsen button on a T-shirt that says: &quot;Jackson in '92.&quot;    Even Mr. Jackson's voter-registration efforts sometimes show more promise than results. When he called on students at Savannah State College to come forward and promise to take buses to go register the next day, the bleachers nearly emptied. But the next day, there were no buses.    It &quot;was sort of an average day for us,&quot; says Betty Smith, chief deputy registrar for Chatam County. &quot;No bus load of people was brought down here by anybody.&quot;    Ed Brown, director of the Voter Education Project in Atlanta, says there has been &quot;some incremental increase&quot; in black registration this year, but &quot;it certainly has not reached the level of intensity it did in '84,&quot; when 91% of the black vote went for Walter Mondale during the Reagan landslide win.    Many Democrats acknowledge that it would be unfair to blame Mr. Jackson for lack of enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket among black voters. &quot;Jesse Jackson is putting in 100% for the ticket,&quot; says James Van Hecke Jr., chairman of the North Carolina Democratic party. &quot;I think he's out there working hard every day and he would not do that if he weren't committed.&quot;    Mr. Jackson's backers argue that the Dukakis camp sometimes has given inadequate support to his efforts. Early this month when Mr. Jackson flew into Cleveland for a campaign stop at the Ebeneezer Baptist Church, the Dukakis campaign provided almost no advance work. Even longtime Jackson supporters didn't know about the event.    The result: That night the church, embarrassingly, was half empty and a room set aside for the overflow crowd wasn't used. TV cameras from local stations panned the empty chairs and interviewed some local black leaders, who angrily rebuked Mr. Dukakis.    Many Jackson supporters, including those who back the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, also accuse Mr. Dukakis of giving black voters little time and effort. The governor shies away from &quot;the hard core issues of the urban centers,&quot; complains Don Payne, a Newark city councilman and Democratic congressional candidate.    In the &quot;final analysis,&quot; Mr. Jackson says in an interview, &quot;it is the responsibility of the ticket to inspire interest and motivation&quot; among its supporters, implying that he isn't to blame if the ticket fails to do so. But he insists that he &quot;genuinely supports&quot; Mr. Dukakis, and he cites a growing closeness between himself and the Dukakis camp, particularly Dukakis confidant John Sasso.    That hardly allays the fears of the Democratic middle-road and conservative Democrats that Mr. Jackson will drag the party to the edge of disaster. The party needs &quot;major surgery&quot; to remove its left wing, Mr. Kemble says. But he concedes: &quot;It's going to be a lot harder because of the strength of someone like Jesse Jackson.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
