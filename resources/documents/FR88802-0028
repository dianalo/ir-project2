Introduction</ITAG>A. Purpose and ScopeThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today proposing one in a seriesof guidelines designed to encourage the use of products containing materialsrecovered from solid waste. Section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act,as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRAor the Act), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6962, states that if a procuring agency,defined as any Federal agency or any State or local procuring agency whichis using appropriated Federal funds, purchases certain designated items,such items must be composed of the highest percentage of recovered materialspracticable. EPA is required to designate these items and to prepare guidelinesto assist procuring agencies in complying with the requirements of section6002.EPA issued the first of these guidelines, for cement and concrete containingfly ash, on January 28, 1983 (48 FR 4230; 40 CFR Part 249). EPA issueda second guideline, for paper and paper products containing recovered materials,on October 6, 1987 (52 FR 37293; 40 CFR Part 250) with concurrently proposedamendments (52 FR 37335). A revised final paper guideline was promulgatedon June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23546). EPA promulgated a final guideline for lubricatingoils containing re-refined oil on June 30, 1988 (53 FR 24699). A guidelinefor asphalt materials containing ground tire rubber was proposed on February20, 1986 (51 FR 6202), while a guideline for retread tires was proposedon May 2, 1988 (53 FR 15624).This preamble describes the requirements for Section 6002, explains thebasis for designating building insulation products as procurement itemssubject to section 6002, and discusses the provisions of the proposed guideline.It also provides information regarding the price, availability, and performanceof building insulation products.B. Requirements of Section 6002Section 6002 of RCRA, ``Federal Procurement,'' directs all procuring agencieswhich use appropriated Federal funds to procure items composed of the highestpercentage of recovered materials practicable, considering competition,availability, technical performance, and cost. Two factors trigger thisrequirement. First, EPA must designate items to which this requirementapplies. Second, the requirement only applies when the purchase price ofthe item exceeds $10,000 or when the quantity of such items or of functionallyequivalent items purchased or acquired in the course of the preceding fiscalyear was $10,000 or more.Section 6002(c) requires procuring agencies to obtain from vendors an estimateof and certification regarding the percentage of recovered materials containedin their products. Federal agencies responsible for drafting or reviewingspecifications for procurement items were required under section 6002(d)(1)to review and revise them by May 8, 1986 in order to eliminate both exclusionsof recovered materials and requirements that items be manufactured fromvirgin materials. In addition, within one year from the date of publicationof a procurement guideline by EPA, the Federal agencies must revise theirspecifications to require the use of recovered materials in such itemsto the maximum extent possible without affecting the intended use of theitem.Section 501 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L.98-616) added paragraph (i) to section 6002 of RCRA. This provision requiresprocuring agencies to develop an affirmative procurement program for procuringitems designated by EPA. The program must assure that items composed ofrecovered materials will be purchased to the maximum extent practicable,be consistent with applicable provisions of Federal procurement law, andcontain at least four elements:(1) A recovered materials preference program;(2) An agency promotion program;(3) A program for requiring estimates, certification, and verificationof recovered material content; and(4) Annual review and monitoring of the effectiveness of the procurementprogram.Under section 6002(e), EPA is required to issue guidelines for use by procuringagencies in complying with the requirements of section 6002. The EPA guidelinesmust designate those items which can be produced with recovered materialsand whose procurement by procuring agencies will fulfill the objectivesof section 6002. They also must provide recommendations for procurementpractices and information on availability, relative price, and performance.Section 6002 is designed to promote materials conservation and therebyto reduce the quantity of materials in the solid waste stream. By usingproducts containing recovered materials, Federal procurement can demonstratetheir technical and economic viability. In addition, Federal procurementguidelines can provide guidance to state and local governments interestedin procuring products containing recovered materials, and Federal procurementof such products is expected to result in increased procurement by theseagencies as well.C. Criteria for Selection of Procurement ItemsIn the preamble to the fly ash guidelines, EPA established the followingfour criteria for the selection of procurement items for which guidelineswill be prepared (48 FR 4231-4232, January 28, 1983);(1) The waste material must constitute a significant solid waste managementprogram due either to volume, degree of hazard, or difficulties in disposal;(2) Economic methods of separation and recovery must exist;(3) The material must have technically proven uses; and(4) The Federal government's ability to affect purchasing or use of thefinal product or recovered material must be substantial.These criteria incorporate all of the factors which section 6002(e) requiresEPA to consider in designating items subject to the section 6002 procurementrequirements. Section III of this preamble demonstrates that building insulation productsmade with recovered materials meet the criteria for designation. Industrialbyproducts currently used to produce building insulation products are alsodiscussed in more detail. D. Background Information on Insulation Products Containing Recovered Materials1. <T3>Introduction to Insulation. </T3>There are many applications for insulation,including building insulation to provide human comfort, equipment insulation,pipe insulation, and refrigeration or cold storage insulation. Buildinginsulation accounts for by far the largest volume of insulation manufacturedand is least likely to require specialty products or materials for specialinsulation purposes. Moreover, the building insulation market is dominatedby products which can and often do contain recovered materials. In this guideline, ``building insulation'', ``building insulation products'',and ``insulation products'' all refer to the insulation uses and producttypes that follow. <T3>Building insulation </T3>refers to a material, primarily designed toresist heat flow, which is installed between the conditioned (heated and/ormechanically cooled) volume of a building and adjacent, unconditioned volumesor the outside. This term includes but is not limited to products suchas blanket, board, spray-in-place, and loose-fill insulation Locations suitable for the installation of building insulation includebut are not limited to ceilings, floors, foundations, and walls. Ceilinginsulation is used between the conditioned area of a building and an unconditionedattic, in common ceiling floor assemblies between separately conditionedunits in multi-unit structures, and between the underside and uppersideof the roof where the conditioned area of a building extends to the roofs.Floor insulation is used between the first level conditioned area of abuilding and an unconditioned basement, a crawl space, or the outside beneathit; and around the perimeter of or on a ground level concrete slab wherethe first level conditioned area of a building is on a slab. Foundationinsulation is used at foundation walls between conditioned volumes andunconditioned volumes and the outside or surrounding earth, at the perimetersof concrete slab-on-grade foundations, and at common foundation wall assembliesbetween conditioned basement volumes. Wall insulation is used within oron the walls between conditioned areas of a building and unconditionedareas of a building or the outside, and in common wall assembles betweenseparately conditioned units in multiple unit structures. The principal categories of insulating materials are fiberglass, plasticrigid foams (polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, polystyrene, and phenolic),rock wool, and cellulose. These materials are sometimes used in combinationin composite products. Insulation products made from these materials dominatethe insulation market and are the primary focus of this guideline. There also are specialty materials, principally calcium silicate, vermiculite,and perlite, used for insulation products. These materials are virgin mineralswhich are neither practical nor economical to recover for recycling, andthey represent a relatively small part of the insulation market. Theseminerals, as well as other specialty materials, however, can also be mixedin composite products with other materials which can contain recoveredmaterials. The primary factors in the choice of insulating material are thermal resistance(R-value); performance standards; price; availability; life-cycle costconsidering the installed cost of insulation in relation to the estimatedreduction in energy cost over the life of the product in use; flammability;corrosiveness of the insulating materials to metallic building components;ease and cost of installation; durability; resistance to moisture absorption;strength; retention of insulating value with time; the dimensions of andaccess to the space to the insulated and the thickness of the insulationdesired. The process of selecting appropriate thermal insulation for buildings maybe broken down in steps as follows: 1. The building type and function is first established, with a view tolocal, national or government codes and standards requirements. Of particularimportance are fire safety and life safety considerations, which affectnecessary insulation characteristics, such as insulation flamespread andpotential smoke or off-gassing of ignited or smoldering insulation. 2. The preliminary design of the exterior building envelope is examined,in relation to the appropriate insulation form and the availability ofspace for the insulation, within the anticipated exterior building assemblies.At this point, a preliminary decision may be made as to whether loose fill,flexible blanket, or rigid materials (or combinations of these) will befinally selected. Thermal resistance (R-value) requirements are then finalized,coordinating these as necessary to dimensions and other considerationssuch as codes. 3. Installation requirements are then considered. Does the insulation requireadditional support, installed by other skilled workers? Is some form offacing or covering material required for fire safety? Will the workersnormally installing the insulation be familiar with the material specifiedand how it should be placed? Will scheduling of other workers be affected?What level of supervision or inspection is necessary? Other installationconsiderations may apply, depending on the size and complexity of the building.4. The level of material and installation costs to be expected is estimated,both as a flat figure and in relation to anticipated building heating andcooling requirements. Installation costs should include all ancillary costsas outlined above. 5. Material specification compliance with code or owner requirements arechecked, and provision of certificates of compliance, as appropriate, isadded as a specification clause. 6. Specification sections, covering necessary inspections, clean-up andany other prepayment requirements are added, as desired. 2. <T3>Types of Recovered Materials Used. </T3>At present, several of themajor types of insulation are commercially available with recovered materialscontent, as defined by RCRA section 1004(19):<ITAG tagnum="21">The term `recovered material' means waste material and byproductswhich have been recovered or diverted from solid waste, but such term doesnot include those materials and byproducts generated from, and commonlyreused within, an original manufacturing process.</ITAG>Some types of insulation are produced using postconsumer materials as feedstocks.\1\<NOTE/> An example of this is cellulose insulation, which is madefrom old newspaper. Others rely on recovered byproducts as feedstocks,such as rock wool insulation, which is primarily made from slags from smeltingprocesses. Fiberglass manufacturers use waste glass from other industries.Plastic foam insulation is made with chemical byproducts, such as dimethylterepthalate (DMT), which would otherwise be disposed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ``Postconsumer material'' is not defined in RCRA. Theterm is defined in various State and local solid waste management laws,however. For example, the following definition from the State of New JerseyMandatory Statewise Source Separation and Recycling Act, Pub. L. 1987,Chapter 2, section 2, has been used as a model by other governments: <ITAG tagnum="28">Postconsumer waste material means any product generated by a businessor a consumer which has served its intended end use, and which has beenseparated from solid waste for the purposes of collection, recycling ordisposition, and which does not include secondary waste material * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``Secondary waste material'' refers to preconsumer materials suchas manufacturing wastes, industrial byproducts, or other wastes resultingfrom the production of an end use product. </ITAG>3. <T3>The Insulation Industry. </T3>The following information puts the insulationindustry in perspective. The national energy conservation movement causedthe insulation industry to grow substantially until 1984. From 1984 tothe present, the insulation industry has shown little or no growth. Accordingto the estimated market share based on dollar volume, fiberglass is thepredominant insulation material (68 percent), followed by rigid plasticfoams (21 percent), rock wool (3 percent), cellulose (3 percent) and allother types including vermiculite, perlite and other specialties (5 percent).Recently, rock wool and fiberglass have lost the greatest share of themarket, while plastic foams have been growing most substantially. During the energy crunch of the late 70s, producers of fiberglass and mineralwool were not able to meet demand. From the mid-70s to the early 80s, fiberglassslipped from 85 percent of the market to around 70 percent, losing marketshare to cellulose and foam plastics. Neither fiberglass nor rock woolhave recovered their market positions. Cellulose fiber plants expanded from 98 in 1973 to 750 in 1978, but theindustry contracted severely after 1977, losing 60 percent of productioncapacity by 1984. An estimate of the 1986 total dollar volume of building insulation at manufacturer'snet price is $2,901,090,000 as shown in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._1986 <T4>Sales of Insulation</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Commercial and industrial roofs <D>$1,150,000,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Residential building <D>825,000,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Attic <D>340,000,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cavity <D>220,000,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheathing <D>165,000,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Slab and basement <D>100,000,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Residential retrofit <D>666,090,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-residential building <D>260,000,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cavity <D>225,000,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Slab and foundation <D>35,000,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total<D>2.901,090,000</D><F>Source: Hull andamp; Company and A.W.

Morever, because government funds are used for alltypes of construction, distinctions between uses have not been considerednecessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Rationale for Designating Building Insulation Products </ITAG>This section of the preamble demonstrates that building insulation productssatisfy EPA's criteria for designating items subject to the procurementrequirements of RCRA section 6002. A. Significant Solid Waste Disposal Problem The first criterion is that the waste material constitutes a significantsolid waste management problem. The waste materials of immediate concernis the production of building insulation are postconsumer newspaper, containerglass, and plastics. Each material represents a significant fraction ofthe municipal solid waste stream as shown by the data in Table 2. In addition,metallurgical slags and certain chemicals are industrial byproducts whichwould contribute to the industrial waste stream if they were not used inproducts like insulation. Some manufacturing wastes, such as plate glassand plastics, raise the same concerns. Although use of these byproductsand manufacturing wastes is already substantial, concerns remain aboutthe contribution of the unrecycled portion to the industrial waste streambecause of the large quantity of material involved. In every case, themanagement problems deal with quantity, not toxicity, of the recyclablematerials.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s225,10,10,10,10 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Selected Items in the Municipal Solid Waste Stream </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In percent of total discards and thousands of tons]</ITAG><H1>  </H1><H1>Total discards </H1><H1>Newspaper </H1><H1>Glass containers </H1><H1>Plastic containers </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1980 <D>125,700</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of total <D> </D><D>6.5 </D><D>10.5 </D><D>1.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tons per year <D> </D><D>8,100 </D><D>13,200 </D><D>2,100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982 <D>124,900</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of total <D> </D><D>6.1 </D><D>10.2 </D><D>1.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tons per year <D> </D><D>7,600 </D><D>12,800 </D><D>2,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984 <D>133,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of total <D> </D><D>6.7 </D><D>8.9 </D><D>1.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tons per year <D> </D><D>9,000 </D><D>11,800 </D><D>2,400</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 <D>141,400</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of total <D> </D><D>6.7 </D><D>8.0 </D><D>2.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tons per year <D> </D><D>9,700 </D><D>11,300 </D><D>2,900</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1995 <D>149,900</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of total <D> </D><D>7.0 </D><D>7.4 </D><D>2.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tons per year <D> </D><D>10,500 </D><D>11,100 </D><D>3,400</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2000 <D>158,800</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of total <D> </D><D>7.2 </D><D>6.8 </D><D>2.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tons per year <D> </D><D>11,400 </D><D>10,800 </D><D>3,900</D><F>Note._Total discards are net of materials recovery prior to disposalbut do not reflect energy recovery.

Therefore eachcategory is discussed separately. 1. <T3>Newspaper. </T3>Newspaper is the most easily recycled material in theresidential waste stream and therefore is targeted for collection mostfrequently. Problems of oversupply of recycled old newspaper have appearedon the East Coast. The number of recycling programs mandated by municipaland State requirements nationwide that are currently in place or in theplanning stages suggests that the oversupply problem may become severenationwide in the near future. The category ``old newspaper'' contains overissue newspapers (newspapersunsold to the public which do not always enter the municipal waste stream)and postconsumer newspaper. Old newspaper is primarily consumed by thepaper industry for a variety of recycled paper products and by the celluloseinsulation industry. Substantial quantities are also exported out of thecountry. In 1983, actual demand for old newspaper, including demand from the paperindustry, exporters, and the cellulose insulation industry was 3.67 millionshort tons. Estimated 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 demand was 3.93 million,3.96 million, 4.23 million, and 4.58 million short tons, respectively.The estimated growth in demand from 1983 to 1987 was therefore 915,700short tons or 24.9 percent. To compare demand with supply, total United States and Canadian productioncapacity for newsprint in 1985 was 16.58 million short tons, with consumptionof newsprint by United States publishers being 13.1 million short tonsin 1986. In 1987, the newsprint industry announced a production capacityexpanion of 1.63 million short tons to be in place by 1990, approximatelya 10 percent increase, with 338,000 tons of this new capacity to be producedfrom old newspaper.In 1986, unused old newspaper supply (total U.S. newsprint consumptionless demand for old newspaper) was 8.71 million short tons. Assuming newspaperquickly enters the waste flow, the 1986 national recovery efforts representedjust under 33 percent of available supplies. National recovery of a feasible50 percent of available supplies would recycle an additional 2.32 milliontons. Assuming all factors remain the same, this would require an increasein demand for old newspapers of 55 percent over 1986 levels. This is morethan twice the growth in demand for the past four years. The new NorthAmerican production capacity which is expected to be on line by late 1990would raise the necessary growth rate in old newspaper use to over 65 percentin order to achieve the same 50 percent recovery rate.2. <T3>Glass. </T3>The largest volume of waste glass in the solid waste streamcomes from containers. According to industry spokesmen, recycling of glasshas increased, with glass container plants currently using an average of20 to 30 percent of cullet \2\<NOTE/> in their mix. Some plants use considerably higher percentagesif the cullet is readily available.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Crushed or processed waste glass is called cullet. In-plantmanufacturing waste (home scrap) is also called cullet and has always beenused in the glass container and fiberglass industries. However, unlessotherwise noted, references to cullet throughout this preamble and guidelinerefer only to pre- and postconsumer waste glass in accordance with theRCRA definition of recovered materials.U.S. Department of Commerce data on container production shows that 309million gross containers with a net packed weight of 12.7 million tonswere produced in 1982. In 1985 and 1986, production was 273 million and283 million gross with net packed weight of 11.10 million and 11 milliontons, respectively. The increase in container quantities may be due tothe stronger economy or to increased use of glass in microwave, wine coolerand other specialty containers.According to 1982 Census of Manufacturers data, the glass container industryconsumed 1.66 million tons of glass cullet (in-plant, pre- and post-consumer)and 13.82 million tons of other materials, including 8 million tons ofsand. This represents 11 percent cullet to the total feedstocks. If alldocumented 1982 cullet consumption in the container industry was postconsumerglass, an unlikely assumption, it would have represented only 13 percentof potential postconsumer cullet supplies, which as previously stated,were 12.7 million tons.Another use of postconsumer bottle cullet, as a substitute aggregate inasphalt paving, has been explored since the 1960s. Experimentation hasincreased in the 1980s and this use appears to be very promising. However,no data exist for the quantities of cullet in current use nor for the potentialdemand if ``glassphalt'' becomes a common paving practice.As of January 1988, it was not difficult to find buyers for postconsumerbottle cullet within reasonable transportation radii. The container industry,using existing equipment, is capable and willing to double its consumption.The only limitation is lack of supplies that are consistent in quantityand quality. The market for postconsumer bottle cullet will also increaseas ``glassphalt'' is used more commonly.Published data on preconsumer (or manufacturing waste glass including flatand window glass, table and cookware and so on) which is brokered to otherusers is not available. The glass processing industry estimates that approximately500,000 tons per year changes hands. Such waste glass, with the exceptionof automotive windshield wastes which are very difficult to process, enterthe waste disposal system only when consumers of cullet are beyond economictransportation distances.3. <T3>Plastic. </T3>Plastics have increased steadily in the waste streamaccording to data presented in the EPA waste characterization report.\3\<NOTE/> Plastic disposal grew from 0.5 million tons in 1960 to 9.6million tons in 1984 or 7 percent of total residential waste. Plasticsare expected to increase to 10 percent of the waste in the year 2000. Althoughmany types of plastic are included in the general trend, polyethylene terephthalate(PET), polystyrene (PS), and manufacturing wastes (DMT and phthalic anhydridebottoms) were analyzed for solid waste management impacts because theyare the only recovered plastics apt to be used in insulation products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Office of Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,<T3>Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States, 1960to 2000 (Update 1988), </T3>Franklin Associates, Ltd., March 30, 1988.Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Trade indicates thatPET use is growing faster than other plastic container resins. From 1985to 1986, PET use grew 37.5 percent compared with high density polyethylene(12.9 percent), low and medium density polyethylene (25.9 percent), polypropylene(4.8 percent), polyvinyl chloride (9.5 percent), polystyrene and others(29.4 percent). The quantity of PS in containers is small, and miscellaneousother resins are included in the data. The rapid growth in PET use is presentedin    Table 3.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,xs36,6,6,r10</C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Consumption of PET in Plastic Bottle Materials</T4><H1>Year</H1><H1>Million lbs.</H1><H1>Tons</H1><H1>Percent growth</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1983<D>420.5</D><D>210,250</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>452.0</D><D>226,000</D><D>7%.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985<D>480.0</D><D>240,000</D><D>6% estimate.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986<D>660.0</D><D>330,000</D><D>37.5% estimate.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987<D>800.0</D><D>400,000</D><D>21% forecast.</D><F>Source: U.S. Department of Commerce.</F></ITAG></ITAG>There are two types of postconsumer PET easily available, containers andused film stock. Industry sources state that PET production for packagingis approaching 1 billion pounds per year with approximately 150 millionpounds (or 15 percent) currently recycled. The industry is targeting 2billion pounds of PET for packaging by 1990. All film stock, includingx-ray, photographic and micrographic, is extruded PET. According to industrysources, approximately 600 million pounds of PET film stock is productedannually. About one third, or 200 million pounds, is x-ray film. Whilespecific data on disposal of used x-ray film is not gathered, one sourcestated that approximately 200 million pounds of used x-ray film is disposedof annually, of which about 10 percent or 20 million pounds is recycled.In addition to postconsumer plastic bottles and film, an average of 5 percentof every type of plastic resin production becomes manufacturers' or industrialwaste plastic annually. Polyester resin production was 6.3 billion poundsin 1985. The amount of manufacturer's polyester waste generated in 1985was estimated to be 315 million pounds. Total supplies of recyclable PETfrom bottles, x-ray film and industrial wastes can be roughly estimatedto be 1.25 billion pounds annually.The Society of the Plastics Industry reported 1986 production of PS resinto be 4.47 billion pounds. Approximately 1.36 billion pounds were producedfor packaging and 418 million pounds for building construction. Productioncapacity was reported to be 5.39 billion pounds.Recycling of postconsumer PS from the municipal waste stream has not beenattempted and data on manufacturers' waste PS is not gathered. For 1986,industrial waste was estimated to be 5 percent of production or 223.5 millionpounds. Manufacturing waste PS is regularly brokered.EPA has identified another industrial waste that could be used to produceplastic rigid foam insulation, DMT. Bottoms are the heavy fraction, orresidue, from plastics production, which may or may not have recoverablematerials. An EPA data base of plastic industry waste products suggeststhat DMT wastes that potentially had value were not recovered for salein 1981; this data base contained only a partial sample of 1981 data, however.Those DMT wastes with value were recovered for internal use or were burnedto extract energy value. DMT wastes without apparent value (e.g., verydilute) did not appear to be recovered at all but were disposed in a varietyof ways.Phthalic anhydride bottoms may also be used, but this has not been documentednor are quantity data and information on phthalic anhydride wastes currentlyavailable from the EPA data base.4. <T3>Slag. </T3>Slag is a by-product from blast furnaces and other metalsmelting processes. According to the National Slag Association, metallurgicalslags from the production of iron and steel do not represent a significantsolid waste management problem. Stockpiles are said to be used efficientlyin most, though not all, parts of the country. Iron-blast-furnace slag(the general term) sold or used totaled 15.4 million short tons in 1986,of which 88 percent or 13.5 million tons were air-cooled iron blast furnaceslag. Road construction materials, such as road base and substitute aggregatesin concrete and asphalt, absorbed 81 percent of the total supply. Rockwool manufacturers purchased 519,000 short tons, or 3.8 percent of theair-cooled iron blast furnace slag. According to recent Bureau of Minesdata, purchases of slag for rock wool fell from 617,000 short tons in 1985to 519,000 short tons in 1986.Based on current data, EPA believes that the major volumes of metallurgicalslags are recycled and do not currently represent a nationwide solid wastemanagement problem. However, increased iron and steel production, increasingcompetition from other recovered materials in roadbuilding, and changesin the national economy could adversely affect the balance of supply anddemand for metallurgical slags in the future with a resulting impact onsolid waste disposal.5. <T3>Conclusions. </T3>EPA concludes that newspaper and plastics (PET andPS) in the municipal waste stream represent solid waste management problemsbased on quantity. Supplies of postconsumer glass are currently used efficiently,and the container industry is capable of doubling its consumption of postconsumercullet. Manufacturing wastes (such as plate glass and plastic scrap) aswell as industrial byproducts (such as metallurgical slags and chemicalbottoms), which qualify under the RCRA definition of recovered materials,would also represent solid waste management problems based on quantityif current markets are interrupted.B. Feasible Methods of RecoveryThe second EPA criterion for selection of reclaimed materials for affirmativeprocurement under RCRA Section 6002 is the existence of economic methodsof separation and recovery.Source separation programs in operation and in the planning stages alltarget newspaper and container glass, and some target container plastics(particularly PET in bottle bill states). Materials are picked up throughcurb-side collection programs, drop-off centers, charity drives and soon. There is no national count of such recycling programs, but in somestates they are as many as 200 local programs. More programs are beingimplemented each year. Government-sponsored collection programs are beingsubsidized because state-sponsored economic analyses have indicated thatrecycling is less expensive than other disposal options.Three states and one city (Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut and Philadelphia),passed mandatory recycling legislation by the end of 1987. Numerous municipalitiesand counties around the country have passed similar local legislation.There also is a healthy system of brokers for materials collected by sourceseparation programs as well as all types of manufacturers' waste materials.1. <T3>Newspaper. </T3>Recycling programs mandated by municipal and Statelaws always target postconsumer newspaper because it is one of the easiestmaterials to collect. The waste paper brokerage system handles a largeproportion of this postconsumer newspaper as well as the pre-consumer oroverissue waste newspaper.Recovery rates in the two leading states have set precedents that othersare trying to equal. New Jersey, according to the American Paper Institute(API), recovered 207,134 tons of old newspaper in 1983. API estimated thetotal recoverable tonnage to be 370,000 tons and the 1983 recovery rateto be 56 percent. The average recovery rate for the nation was 30 percentthe same year. Oregon, with excellent markets for old newspaper, has achieveda recovery rate of 75 percent according to the Oregon Department of EnvironmentalQuality.2. <T3>Glass. </T3>The Glass Packaging Institute reported in 1987 that seventeennon-bottle bill states and the District of Columbia have joined individualstate or joint state associations to foster collection of glass containersand publicize redemption centers. For example, the Pennsylvania Glass RecyclingCorporation publishes a newsletter that listed forty-three ``glass forcash'' centers within the state in 1987. Beverage Industry Recycling Programsserve some of the same non-bottle bill states as well as three others.In addition, ten bottle bill states have developed glass collection andprocessing systems. The EPA waste characterization report estimated that1.25 million tons of glass were recycled in 1986, just under ten percentof the available supply. This compares with 368,000 tons or barely threepercent ten years earlier.Processing centers have been established in both bottle bill and non-bottlebill states to crush and clean glass to market specifications. A new centerin Pennsylvania opened in the summer of 1987 with annual processing capacityof over 100,000 tons per year. The center is operated by a private companywith 17 other glass processing facilities and depots around the country.Other privately owned and operated glass processing facilities exist nationwide.While national data is not gathered on the numbers of these facilitiesnor the quantities of cullet they handle, new processing centers, bothpublic and private, are opening in urban areas all around the country.The container glass industry requires bottle cullet to be color-sorted,a labor intensive process which either requires citizens to do the colorseparating or requires hand sorting lines at the processing centers. Mixed-colorcullet is suitable for aggregate substitute in ``glassphalt''. THe fiberglassindustry has accepted color-mixed cullet in the past, although fiberglassfurnaces are much more sensitive than container furnaces to contaminantssuch as carbon, plastics and metals. Recycling programs are being proposedand implemented that stress quantity over color separation. If sufficientdemand develops for color-mixed cullet, it should become available becauseit is less expensive to collect and process. The technology has alreadybeen developed to prepare cullet for aggregate substitutes. Additionalprocessing to remove contaminants and prepare color-mixed cullet to fiberglassindustry specifications is more complex and therefore more expensive. However,processing lines will be developed if supplies of postconsumer cullet aregreater than other markets can absorb.3. <T3>Plastic. </T3>Postconsumer PET containers are recovered primarily inthe bottle bill states, although some additional state and local governmentsare planning collection for PET and other plastic containers. Accordingto the EPA waste characterization report, 63,000 tons of soft drink bottles(PET with high density polyethylene (HDPE) base cups) were recovered in1984 from collection in bottle bill states. This represented 18 percentof national production and 1 percent of gross plastic discards.Used x-ray film and other film stock is processed to recover silver nitrateand other metals, then is disposed or routed for further contaminant removaland sale or to disposal facilities. At least one company has been establishedto decontaminate x-ray plastics and market clean PET film scrap. In 1987,throughput at this mill was about 6 million pounds per year. The designcapacity for the mill is 48 million pounds (or 24,000 short tons) per year.This capacity represents approximately 25 percent of the estimated usedx-ray stock.Postconsumer PS is not currently recovered for recycling. Although datais not gathered systematically for manufacturing waste PS, one broker roughlyestimated that 200 million pounds of crystalline and foam PS are purchasedand sold in some form to other users. If waste PS can be accumulated in40,000 pound truckloads, and if these wastes meet specifications for contamination,users can be found.The network of waste plastic brokers will handle any plastic waste forwhich it can find an economically feasible market. This entails a marketvalue high enough to cover the costs of processing and transportation.The DMT bottoms are definitely in commercial use and therefore must beeconomically feasible to recover as explained above. The use of phthalicanhydride bottoms has not yet been documented.4. <T3>Slag. </T3>Metallurgical slag is used as an aggregate substitute inroad construction and as the raw material for most rock wool insulationmade in the United States. Collection and transportation of this industrialbyproduct appears to be well established.5. <T3>Conclusions. </T3>EPA has concluded that feasible recovery methodsexist for postconsumer newspaper, glass, and PET plastics. The industrialbyproducts, slag and DMT bottoms, as well as preconsumer, or manufacturingwaste, PET and PS, are also recovered efficiently.C. Technically Proven UsesThe third EPA criterion for selection of reclaimed materials for affirmativeprocurement under RCRA Section 6002 is that the material has technicallyproven uses in the designated items. Recovered materials are currentlycommercially acceptable feedstocks in five types of insulating materialscovered by the guideline proposed today: cellulose, composites, fiberglass,plastic rigid foam, and rock wool.1. <T3>Cellulose. </T3>There are two types of cellulose insulation products_celluloseinsulation and cellulose fiberboard.a. <T3>Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on insulation. </T3>Cellulose insulationis made from approximately 75 percent waste paper; the remaining portionconsists of chemicals to retard flammability and to deter insects and pests.While there is some spray-on cellulose insulation made from waste paper,the industry predominately makes loose-fill insulation which is blown intowalls and attics.Cellulose insulation comprises about 3 percent of the insulation marketaccording to a 1987 industry estimate. The cellulose insulation producedin 1984 consumed approximately 480,000 tons of recycled paper. More recentdata has not been obtained.The Department of Commerce listed 371 manufacturers of cellulose insulationin 1983. Four years later, in July 1987, the Cellulose Industry StandardsEnforcement Program (CISEP) identified 138 active firms. This indicatescontinued shrinkage in the cellulose insulation industry. Thirteen of thecompanies identified by CISEP produced approximately 20 percent of thecellulose insulation manufactured in 1987. Cellulose insulation manufacturersare located all across the country; consequently availability to procurementagencies should present no problems.b. <T3>Cellulose fiberboard. </T3>A range of fiberboards are made with postconsumerrecovered paper, which provides short fibers that complement longer, coarserfibers from wood. Some boards are made entirely from postconsumer paper.Cellulose fiberboards are made in panels of varying thicknesses. They areoften called insulating boards, although they are used for structural reasonsas well as for their insulation properties. The American Society of HeatingRefrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) includes two paper-basedcategories under the general term vegetable fiberboard: ``Laminated paperboard''and ``homogenous board from repulped paper''. R-value, according to ASHRAE,is about 2.Cellulosic fiberboard, a related product, is predominantly made with woodfibers, and is more frequently identified as a structural product. EPAwas unable to determine whether any or all cellulosic fiberboards containpostconsumer recovered paper. Therefore, EPA solicits comments on whetherthe category ``cellulosic fiberboard'' as defined by the American Societyof Testing and Materials (ASTM) can be produced with postconsumer recoveredpaper.Manufacturers of cellulose fiberboards no longer have a trade association,and data regarding market share is not available. The American Paper Institutegroups data about ``insulating boards'' within the construction paper andboard category. Estimated production of insulating board for 1986 to 1989remained flat at 1,178,000 short tons. The entire construction paper andboard category was estimated at 2.2 million short tons, with estimatedconsumption of recovered paper materials growing from 929,000 short tonsin 1986 to just over 1 million short tons in 1989. The recovered paperfeedstocks were predominantly postconsumer newspaper, mixed paper and corrugated.There is no estimate of recovered paper consumption for insulating boardsalone.At least one company, Homasote, uses 100 percent postconsumer recoveredpaper material in its products. This was not true for all other companies.One uses preconsumer kraft paper trimmings, others use a proportion ofpostconsumer paper with virgin ingredients such as wood fibers, binders,waxes, clays, starches and so on.2. <T3>Perlite Insulation Board. </T3>Some composite boards are made withexpanded perlite aggregate (a virgin mineral), small amounts of selectedbinders, and waste newsapers. The materials are mixed together and formedinto rigid, flat, rectangular units which may have facings on one or bothsides according to the ASTM C-728-82 standard specification. Perlite boardis primarily used for commerical- and industrial-type roof insulation.Market growth for this specialty product follows growth in the gross nationalproduct and is expected to remain at 1987 levels for the next few years.Approximately 0.2 pounds of newspaper is used per board foot of the finishedproduct. Approximately 500 million board feet were produced in 1987 bythe only two known manufacturers, consuming about 50,000 tons of wastenewspaper. The percentage of newspaper to other ingredients varies from23 percent to 30 percent according to individual product characteristics,with the average about 24 percent. Product availability to government procuringagencies is limited only because it is manufactured by just two companies.3. <T3>Fiberglass Insulation. </T3>Fiberglass insulation is primarily madefrom sand, limestone, soda ash, and boron. There are other material addedto product mixes in small quantities. The materials are melted togetherand spun into filaments called ``batt''. Cullet is a substitute for sand,limestone, and soda ash. Boron, the most expensive primary ingredient,is not contained in bottle or plate glass cullet.Recovered materials used in fiberglass insulation products include pre-consumerwaste glass from other manufacturing processes, such as plate glass, containerglass, transition cullet (material from glass furnaces produced while mixesare being changed), as well as postconsumer bottle cullet in isolated instances.Home scrap (scrap produced in the fiberglass manufacturing process) isalways consumed by the generator. Mixed-color waste glass can be used bythe fiberglass industry if the mixtures are consistent batch to batch,However, green and amber bottle cullet introduces trace metals used tocreate the colors which can cause difficulties in fiberglass furnaces.Variations in quantities of the colors change the characteristics of melt,and therefore require costly process adjustments.Some manufacturers have stated that there are production advantages inusing recycled glass. Melting cullet instead of melting virgin materialsprovides a 10-15 percent energy savings, and use of cullet can speed upproduction lines, increasing the production rate. At least one fiberglassplant was using 40 percent or more recycled material in 1986, includingpostconsumer bottle cullet. However, this is not common to the industrynor consistently done within the parent company.Other manufacturers dispute this finding; they generally consider bottlecullet to be an unacceptable feedstock for a number of reasons. First,and most important, it is not consistently available, which would interruptlong term contracts from feedstock suppliers of limestone, soda ash andsand. Long term contracts for feedstocks tend to stabilize the costs ofproduction and assure preferred customer status in times of raw materialscarcity. Second, as discussed above, batches of postconsumer mixed-colorbottle cullet do not consistently contain the same percentages of individualcolors which causes processing disruptions. Third, price is a restrainton using bottle cullet. At 1986 costs of production, a price of $.02-.025per pound ($40-$50 per ton) for green glass cullet was said to be acceptable.The fourth factor is contaminants. While cullet does not have to be colorsorted, even minor contamination with metal, plastics, ceramics, or carboncauses problems in fiberglass processing lines.Glass processors do sell postconsumer bottle cullet to fiberglass manufacturersin most parts of the country, although not in great amounts. The broadercategory of preconsumer or manufacturing waste cullet is used more commonly.While data is not gathered, knowledgeable sources estimate 175,000 tonsof preconsumer cullet is sold to the fiberglass industry annually. Unlikethe glass container industry which favors bottle cullet partly becauseit contains the key ingredient soda ash, the fiberglass industry obtainsmuch of the needed soda value from other raw materials containing aluminaand boron. Therefore, neither soda ash costs nor scarcities have much impacton the costs of producing fiberglass.Some fiberglass manufacturers indicated interest in using postconsumercullet if it was available in consistent quantities and quality at competitiveprices. These companies believed that cullet processing technology wouldhave to be improved to meet their specifications for consistent color mixand low contaminant levels.With nearly 70 percent market share, fiberglass dominates the total insulationindustry. In 1987, there were six companies producing fiberglass insulationat 26 locations. The manufacturers have fairly good geographic spread aroundthe country; availability is only in question when the entire insulationindustry has difficulty meeting demand, as happened during the energy crisisof the 1970s.4. <T3>Rigid Plastic Foams. </T3>Rigid plastic foam insulation is made byexpanding resins to create cells. Blowing agents are used to enhance theformation of cells and, in some cases, the blowing agent remains trappedwithin the cells to increase insulating properties. Rigid foam insulationshave higher R-values than equivalent thicknesses of other insulations,although they tend to cost more. The higher the R-value, the better theinsulating properties.There are several basic types of plastic rigid foam in general use, includingpolyurethane, polyisocyanurate, polystyrene, and phenolics. Phenolics representand very small though growing fraction of the total. The use of plasticrigid foam insulation appears to be growing the most rapidly of all typesof insulation, although data is not consistently published, and informationfrom different sources rarely agrees. However, despite variations in thedata, it is established that polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, and polystyrenefoams have an important share of the total market. An estimate of totalrigid foam boardstock consumption in residential and commercial applicationswas presented at a Society of the Plastics Industry conference in 1985.Polyurethane foam use was expected to grow from 230 million pounds in 1984to 249 million pounds and 280 million pounds in 1986 and 1990, respectively.Projected polystyrene growth for the same years was from 285 to 315 to375 million pounds. Phenolic growth, again for 1984, 1986, and 1990, wasestimated at 10 to 11 to 15 million pounds.a. <T3>Polyurethane and polyisocyanurate insulation. </T3>References to polyurethane(PU) and polyisocyanurate (PIR) insulations tend to be confusing. The termpolyurethane foam can also refer to the flexible foams used for cushioning.Data for PU and PIR feedstocks and insulation production quantities arefrequently grouped together under the term polyurethane and sometimes areincluded under the broader term urethane (U). The differences between PUand PIR rigid foam are slight and do not affect the use of recovered materials.For simplification, in this proposed guideline, the term polyisocyanurate/polyurethane(PIR/PU) will be used, although the original terms will be preserved incited data.PIR/PU insulation is primarily board and laminated board products usedto insulate walls, roofing, and doors in residential and commercial buildings.The physical blowing agent is trapped in the cells of PIR/PU rigid foamsand contributes to the high R- value.PIR/PU board insulation is made with various formulas depending on therequirements of the final product. Ingredients are used in the followingranges:andbullet; Isocyanate_53-57%.andbullet; Aromatic polyester polyol_30-20%.andbullet; Blowing agent_15-20%.andbullet; Surfactants and catalysts_2-3%.PIR/PU foam-in-place insulation (with two sub-categories, spray-in-placeand pour-in-place) is a smaller segment of the market. It is used primarilyfor roofing insulation and injection into cavities, with some used in wallinsulation. PIR/PU foam-in-place ingredients are combined on site and injectedinto position where the mixture expands and hardens in place. An estimateof the size of the PIR/PU foam-in-place market was developed for the Departmentof Energy. In 1982, approximately 65 million pounds of foam were used,primarily in roofs, expanding to approximately 88 million pounds in 1986.The formulation percentages of PIR/PU foam-in-place are basically 40 percentisocyanate to 40 percent polyol to 20 percent blowing agent and other ingredients.Unlike boardstock, where the ingredients are mixed as they are used, PIR/PUfoam-in-place is premixed and sold to installers in drums. Shelf-life ofsix months is the industry standard. Formulations with more than 30 percentpolyester in the polyol fraction break down in less than six months andviscosity is seriously impaired. Polyol is the component in all types of PIR/PU rigid foam insulation thatcan contain recovered materials. ASTM defines polyol in cellular plasticusage to ``include compounds containing alcoholic hydroxyl groups suchas polyethers, glycols, polyesters, and castor oil used in urethane foam.''Industry sources have stated that the foam insulation market for polyolis approximately 100 million to 120 million pounds per year. Two typesof polyol are used by the PIR/PU industry, aromatic polyester polyol andpolyether polyol:andbullet; <T3>Aromatic polyester polyol</T3> can be derived from recycled pre- andpostconsumer PET or from the chemicals DMT and phthalic anhydride. Thepolyol is made by reacting glycol with the other ingredients. In some cases,waste DMT bottoms are used; phthalic anhydride possibly are used, as well.Various manufacturers contacted between 1986 and 1988 suggested the DMTbottoms and possibly phthalic anhydride bottoms were commonly recoveredto produce feedstock resins for plastic rigid foam insulation products.PET polyols are 45 percent PET to 50 percent glycol. DMT polyols are 50percent DMT to 50 percent glycol.andbullet; <T3>Polyether polyol</T3> is derived from polypropelene oxide, a virginmaterial process. The insulation industry has switched almost entirelyfrom polyether polyols to the less expensive polyester polyols for boardstock.Premixed foam-in-place insulation uses about 70 percent polyether and 30percent polyester to avoid loss of viscosity in storage.At least one company, Freeman Chemical, is marketing polyols made fromboth postconsumer and manufacturing waste PET bottles as well as x-rayand other films. X-ray film has a lower intrinsic viscosity (IV) than PETbeverage bottles and is therefore less valuable for other uses. However,as long as demand for PET bottle materials remains lower than supplies,PET bottle scrap will continue to be used. Other companies are marketingpolyols derived from chemical bottoms.Twenty manufacturers of PIR/PU board have been identified with productionfacilities in 36 locations. Distribution across the country is fairly goodin the northwest and mid-northern states. Although it was not determinedhow many of these insulation manufacturers use polyols derived from recoveredmaterials, nor exactly how many polyol producers are using recovered materialsrather than virgin feedstocks, one third of the polyols currently marketedfor PIR/PU rigid foam insulation are said to be derived from recoveredmaterials.b. <T3>Polystyrene insulation. </T3>Polystyrene insulation for building constructionis produced by two processes. Expanded polystyrene foams incorporate ablowing agent, usually pentane, with polystyrene beads which are expandedwith steam or hot air. The resulting ``prepuff'' is aged for six to twenty-fourhours before the final product is made in a heated mold. The product isthen cooled in the mold to assure uniformity and good quality.Extruded polystyrene is made by combining polystyrene base resin with ablowing agent in one extruder, feeding the melt through a cooling extruderthen through a die for the desired shape. Flame retardants are also addedto the product mix. Like the PIR/PU foams, blowing agents are generallyretained within the cellular structure to improve R-values.Representatives from several manufacturers of polystyrene insulation indicatedthat use of recovered material content is technically feasible. However,one source stated that polystyrene with flame retardants could not be reused,which would appear to restrict the use of home scrap in polystyrene insulationmanufacture. Despite indications that research and development effortsmay be underway, current use of recovered materials could not be documented.EPA identified 77 manufacturers of polystyrene insulation. These includeproducers of both extruded polystyrene and expanded polystyrene products.Numerous other small companies are said to be in business around the country.Geographically, the identified polystyrene insulation manufacturers arespread as widely as the producers of other types of insulation products.c.<T3> Phenolic insulation.</T3> Phenolic rigid foam insulation is said tohave very high R-values per inch, good fire retardation, and potentiallylow cost, among other characteristics. It is a fairly new product, butthe relative market share is expected to grow rapidly from its currentsmall base. Phenolic foam production is similar to PIR/PU foam, althoughthe ingredients differ. Aromatic polyester polyols are used in small quantitiesas a plasticizer. The product formulations vary according to specific productand manufacturer. Product mixes are also guarded competitive secret becausethe product is new. Therefore, the following list of ingredients do notadd to 100 percent.andbullet; Phenolic resin_65%-85%.andbullet; Blowing agent_5%-15%.andbullet; Catalyst and surfactants_5.5%-21.5%.andbullet; Polyester polyol_3%-10%.Unlike the approximate 1 to 1 ratio of glycol to other ingredients in PIR/PUpolyols, aromatic polyester polyol in phenolic foam manufacture uses 10percent glycol to other ingredients. The 90 percent fraction of the polyolcontains the recovered material. However, one manufacturer stated thatlarger percentages of polyol used as a plasticizer produce an end productthat is too soft for commercial application with mechanized roofing equipment,and therefore a higher percentage of recovered material is technicallyimpracticable.Only two manufacturers of phenolic foam were identified, which is the onlylimit on availability for government procurement.5. <T3>Rock Wool.</T3> Rock Wool is used as loose-fill insulation and alsois sold in batts and blankets, although production of batts and blanketsis phasing out. While rock wool and fiberglass insulation manufacturersare not necessarily the same companies, they all belong to the same tradeassociations and the two products are usually tracked together under thegeneral heading mineral fibers.Rock wool insulation is most frequently made from metallurgical slag, suchas slag from steel mills. Approximately 70 percent of the rock wool producedin 1980 was primarily made from blast furnace slag, the other 30 percentwas primarily made from steel and copper slag. Not all rock wool manufacturersdepend entirely on slag for their feedstock needs, however. Some use traprock or basaltic rock. Use of slag or alternatives depends on the availabilityand costs of the materials and their location to production facilities.The rock wool industry is shrinking, and data is no longer consistentlygathered. However, conversations with manufacturers in 1988 indicated thatmore companies are using higher percentages of natural rock than were in1980.Natural rock is said to have a lower comparative yield. Slag has a highermelting alumina silicate than natural rock, which makes slag-based insulationattractive in commercial and residential installations where fire protectionis important. For comparative purposes, fiberglass is affected by heatat 1,200-1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to rock wool, where temperaturesmust exceed 1,800-2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the wool is affected.The manufacture of rock wool with slag is linked to the metal smeltingindustries, which provide the principal feedstocks. Smelting in the UnitedStates is decreasing, and there is strong demand for metallurgical slagsas aggregate substitutes in asphalt and concrete for road construction.Slag for rock wool must be of higher quality and contain fewer contaminantsthan slag for substitute aggregates. Although rock wool manufacturers aresaid to pay premium prices, some slag suppliers are said to prefer volumeto specialty customers. For example, in 1986, the demand for slag for rockwool production was 3.8 percent of total slag supplies, compared to demandfor slag for use as aggregates, which was 81 percent of total suppliesof slag. Rock wool manufacturers have reported some difficulties in obtainingslag supplies in the southern part of the country. There are no sourcesof postconsumer recovered material for this type of insulation.Rock wool insulation's market share has been decreasing in recent years.One estimate based on data gathered in 1985 was 9-10 percent of the totalmarket; the percentage dropped to 3 percent in another estimate in 1987.Changes in the industry and in trade associations have made it difficultto make a more accurate assessment. The most recent data cited was for1982, when U.S. production of rock wool was estimated to be 1.0 billionpounds (453,500 metric tons). Ten manufacturers of rock wool insulationwere identified, with plants in 18 locations. Trade association representativesstated that a number of small companies do not belong to the associationsand therefore may not be included in this total. Rock wool insulation manufacturersare primarily located in the mid-west and the southern states, with a fewcompanies located in the northeast.6. <T3>Conclusions.</T3> EPA concludes that six of the principal types ofinsulation materials used in the United States are commercially availablewith recovered materials content: Cellulose, cellulose fiberboard, fiberin perlite boards, polyurethane/polyisocyanurate rigid foam, phenolic rigidfoam, and rock wool. Moreover, industry sources have suggested that polystyreneinsulation containing recovered materials is technically feasible; commercialuse of recovered materials was not identified, however.Based on the evidence reviewed above, EPA further notes that insulationmeeting a wide range of construction design applications is available withrecovered materials content. EPA did not evaluate the potential for recoveredmaterials usage in specialty types of insulation made with virgin materialsbecause they represent such a small portion of the insulation market.EPA further concludes that fiberglass insulation often contains preconsumermanufacturing waste glass and may contain some postconsumer cullet, butthe percentages are not consistent from manufacturer to manufacturer norfrom batch to batch. Representatives from some of the fiberglass companieshave indicated willingness to use more postconsumer cullet if it can meettheir specifications for contaminants and if consistent supplies are madeavailable at competitive prices.D. Federal Purchasing Power The fourth EPA criterion for selection of a procurement item for affirmativeprocurement under RCRA Section 6002 is that the Federal government's abilityto affect purchasing or use of the item, when it contains recovered materials,be substantial. The dollar volume of the building insulation industry was estimated byHull andamp; Company in 1986 to be $2.24 billion excluding retrofit of residentialbuildings. A.W. Johnson estimated the 1986 residential retrofit insulationmarket to be $6.7 million. The total 1986 building insulation market, atmanufacturer's net price is estimated to be $2.9 billion. Other industryspokesmen estimated the total market to be $3 billion in 1985. The samesources stated that the industry was holding even, with neither major growthnor shrinkage.1. <T3>Federal Government.</T3> Government agencies purchase, or finance purchaseswith appropriated Federal funds, residential, industrial, and commercialtypes of insulation products. Expenditures for insulation purchased withappropriated Federal dollars is conservatively estimated to be $148 million.This figure represents only those expenditures that could be estimatedbased on assured insulation use by an agency. Open market expendituresat the local level may be considerable but could not be estimated becausecentralized records are not currently maintained. Based on 1986 estimatesof market size and identified government purchases, the Federal governmentaccounts for approximately 5.1 percent of the insulation market. Procurementsby individual agencies are summarized in Table 4.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The basis for these estimates is explained in <T3>Feasibility of a Federal Procurement Guideline for Recovered Materialsin Insulation Products,</T3> E.H.

It is probable that appropriated Federal dollars account for aconsiderably higher percentage of market share. Insulation is rarely trackedas a line item in any budget. In the one case that EPA knows of, the dataare not yet available.The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that 20 percent of its expendituresfor the Weatherization Program is spent for insulation. Funds are distributedthrough state agencies, which in turn use a variety of methods to distributemonies through local housing authorities and local grantees. The InstitutionalConservation program roughly estimated total insulation expenditures fromwhich an average annual expenditure was computed.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) distributes Low IncomeHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds. Under this program, statesare allowed to spend up to 15 percent of their allocation on weatherization.As these funds are distributed by the same state agencies as DOE funds,the same 20 percent estimate for insulation was used.Many Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs providefunds for building construction and/or rehabilitation. Insulation expendituresare not tracked at the national level. HUD funds are distributed many ways,for instance through the ten regional HUD offices, through local housingauthorities or through block grants to states where priorities are determinedlocally.Most HUD funds that are dispersed where they could be used to purchaseinsulation are considered loans. However, loans are repaid through Federalfunds and subsidies, not from the private sector. In addition, HUD mortgageinsurance programs range from $30 to $100 billion per year, and energyefficiency remains a high priority. The insulation component would be $228to $760 million. This estimate derived from mortgage insurance was notincluded in the estimate of Federal purchases of insulation because itcould not be established that direct or indirect expenditures of appropriatedFederal funds actually take place in insurance programs.At the General Services Administration (GSA), insulation is purchased directlyfor use by government agencies and is also purchased through constructioncontracts. The entire direct purchase program is being revised from warehousedpurchases to requirement contracts which allow agencies to buy what theyneed directly from suppliers under annual contract. Direct expenditureswere determined as available. All GSA expenditures for insulation are directuse of Federal funds.Divisions of the Department of Defense (DOD), the Army, Navy and the AirForce, do not track direct purchases of insulation. Construction projectswhich would include insulation were estimated from the general constructionbudget (which includes non-insulated items like bridges). All DOD expendituresfor insulation are direct use of Federal funds.2. <T3>Impact on State and Local Governments.</T3> A significant number ofthe Federal programs disperse their funds through state, local and non-profitagencies. Funds are not specifically earmarked for insulation purchases;rather monies are used for weatherization, building construction, rehabilitationand so on, usually through construction contracts.State and local agencies are required to comply with EPA procurement guidelinesunder the conditions described in Section IV(C) of this preamble. EPA believesthat once affirmative procurement programs are established by state andlocal agencies in compliance with their obligations when using Federalfunds, the same provisions that favor the use of recovered material contentwill be used for other insulation purchases.3. <T3>Conclusions.</T3> EPA concludes that the expenditure of Federal fundsfor insulation would have a significant impact on the insulation market.EPA believes not only that direct Federal government agency purchases wouldhave an impact, but also that a considerable ripple effect would developthrough state and local governments that use local funds as well as Federalfunds for major programs.E. Other ConsiderationsThere is an additional factor affecting insulation which EPA included inits development of the guideline proposed today. Both pre- and postconsumerwaste materials (e.g., newspaper, glass, plastic) and industrial byproducts(e.g., slag and chemical bottoms) are used in many different types of buildinginsulation products. Building insulation products produced with pre- andpost-consumer materials and building insulation products produced withbyproducts compete for the same end use. Although the byproducts and somepre-consumer materials used in building insulation products are not currentlya solid waste management problem, EPA is concerned that a preference onlyfor building insulation products containing certain pre- and post-consumermaterials could possibly result in other materials and byproducts endingup in the solid waste stream. Therefore, EPA has intentionally includedwithin the scope of the proposed guideline insulation products made withall pre-consumer materials and industrial byproducts that qualify as recoveredmaterials under the RCRA definition. EPA solicits comments on includingthis range of insulation products within this guideline.F. Conclusions Regarding the Designation of Building Insulation ProductsBased on the analysis above, including economic and environmental considerations,EPA has determined that building insulation products containing ``recoveredmaterials'' as defined by RCRA meet the criteria for designation as a procurementitem under the provisions of section 6002.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Proposed Guideline</ITAG>This portion of the preamble explains each section of the proposed guideline.A. PurposeThe purpose of this guideline is to (1) designate building insulation products,as described below, as items subject to the procurement requirements ofsection 6002 of RCRA; and (2) recommend procedures for complying with Section6002.Insulation products are not fungible items and consequently do not competein the marketplace on the basis of price alone. Technical performance considerationsmay dictate use of one type of insulation material rather than another.EPA believes that the intent of RCRA would best be served by identifyingand increasing the use of recovered materials content in as many differenttypes of insulation products as possible. Competition between product type(e.g., loose-fill, blanket, board, or spray-in-place) or material type(e.g., cellulose, fiberglass, rock wool, rigid plastic foam, and specialtymaterials) would therefore continue, while use of recovered materials wouldincrease. Consequently, EPA has sought to include all the major types ofinsulation in commercial use within this proposed guideline. EPA solicitscomment on this approach to performance criteria.B. ScopeThis guideline applies to building insulation products. This term includesbut is not limited to insulation products used in residential, commercialand industrial type applications such as blanket, board, spray-in-place,and loose-fill. As explained in Section II.D of this preamble, buildinginsulation is used in four locations: Ceilings, floors, foundations, andwalls. The types of materials from which these products are made includebut are not limited to: Cellulose and cellulosic fiber, fiberglass, rockwool, plastic rigid foams, and specialty materials. Composite productsmade from more than one material are also included within the scope.All of the predominant types of building insulation products are includedwithin the scope of this proposed guideline, and all contain, or have thetechnical potential to contain, recovered materials. In addition, specialtymaterials for all types of building insulation or insulation ingredientswhere recovered material content use may not have been documented (e.g.,vermiculite and polystyrene) <T3>are</T3> included within the scope of this guideline.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Section 6002(d)(2) of RCRA requires the ``use of recoveredmaterials to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intendeduse of the item.'' This statutory provision effectively allows procuringagencies to exclude use of recovered materials from specifications whenperformance standards for an item cannot be met if recovered materialsare included in the content. Thus, the specifications for particular typesof building insulation materials that do not or could not contain recoveredmaterials must be based upon performance criteria. EPA suggests a procedurefor Federal agencies to establish such an exclusion in andSection; 248.11of the proposed guideline as discussed below under Specifications.In this proposed guideline, recommendations for minimum content standardsand any references to recovered material content refer only to the corematerial of an insulation product and do not include any facings, bindings,or other materials applied to the surfaces of the core materials. In thecase of composite products made from more than one material, proposed minimumcontent standards apply to the respective materials used in the core unlessthe product is specifically addressed.EPA has included insulation made with postconsumer recovered paper in thescope of this proposed guideline as well as stressed its use in buildinginsulation products to meet EPA's responsibility under section 6002(c)(1).Section 501 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L.98-616), amended section 6002(c)(1) to stress the maximum practicable use,in the case of paper, of postconsumer recovered materials. These postconsumerpaper materials are defined as:<ITAG tagnum="21">Paper, paperboard, and fibrous wastes from retail stores, office buildings,homes and so forth, after they have passed through their end-usage as aconsumer item, including: used corrugated boxes, old newspapers, old magazines,mixed waste paper, tabulating cards, and used cordage, and all paper, paperboard,and fibrous wastes that enter and are collected from municipal solid waste.</ITAG>There are other types of insulating products, such as air handling, acoustical,pipe, and cold storage insulation. Building insulation was chosen becauseit is by far the largest volume of insulation manufactured, is least likelyto require virgin specialty materials for specialty purposes, and is dominatedby the types of insulation products that for physical or chemical reasonscan contain recovered materials. Government purchases of insulation productswould also tend to have the greatest impact on this category.Other types of insulation are defined as follows:<T3>Air Handling Insulation </T3>may be in flexible or rigid board formand serves to control heat transfer from the inside to or from the ambientsurround of rectangular, oval or round ducts, which usually contain conditionedair. The insulation system may include a factory or field-applied watervapor or weather resistant exterior membrane or covering jacket.<T3>Acoustical Insulations </T3>are manufactured in flexible blanket, rigidboard or specialty shaped sections and are intended for use in sound attenuationapplications. They may include interior or facing membranes, which arefactory applied.<T3>Cold Storage Insulation</T3> is specifically designed for use in theexterior envelope of refrigerator and freezer storage buildings and rooms.It is usually applied to the inside structural building sections and isdesigned to perform at subzero temperatures. Critical performance requirementsinclude compressive strength, minimum coefficient of expansion, and permanentthermal resistance.<T3>Pipe Insulation </T3>is manufactured in performed sections as thermalinsulation suitable for application to round piping or tubing which servesto transport liquids or gasses at temperatures above or below the ambientsurroundings. The insulation system may include a factory or field-appliedwater vapor or weather resistant exterior membrane or covering jacket.These other types of insulation products must meet different and frequentlymore stringent specifications and are believed to be less easily adaptedto manufacture with recovered materials. EPA solicits comments on any orall of these other types of insulation products regarding whether (1) theycontain recovered materials, (2) government expenditures represent a significantpercentage of total purchases, and (3) they should be included within thescope of this proposed guideline.C. ApplicabilityMany of the requirements of section 6002 apply to ``procuring agencies,''which is defined by RCRA in section 1004(17) as ``any Federal agency, orany State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State whichis using appropriated Federal funds for such procurement, or any personcontracting with any such agency with respect to work performed under suchcontract.'' Under section 6002(a), the procurement requirements apply toany purchase by a procuring agency of an item costing $10,000 or more orwhen the procuring agency purchased $10,000 worth of the item or of a functionallyequivalent item during the preceding fiscal year.In addition, the requirements of section 6002 apply to each Federal agencyas a whole. This point is particularly important in determining whetherthe $10,000 threshold has been reached. For example, the Department ofHousing and Urban Development as a whole, purchases, or causes the purchaseof, more than $10,000 worth of building insulation products during eachfiscal year. Therefore, the requirements of section 6002 will apply toall HUD procurements of building insulation products, including procurementsby individual regions and subagencies, by state and local grantees andtheir contractors, and by HUD contractors.1. <T3>Direct Purchases. </T3>For the purposes of this guideline, purchasesmade as a result of a solicitation by a procuring agency for its own generaluse or that of other agencies (for example, GSA purchases) are considered``direct''. Insulation purchased as part of a construction contract isalso considered a ``direct purchase.''2. <T3>Indirect Purchases. </T3>The definition of ``procuring agency'' inRCRA section 1004(17) makes it clear that the requirements of section 6002apply to ``indirect purchases,'' i.e., purchases by a State or local agencyor its contractors using appropriated Federal funds. Thus, the guidelineapplies to insulation purchases meeting the $10,000 threshold made by Statesand their localities or their contractors, subcontractors, grantees, orother persons which are funded by grants, loans, or other forms of disbursementsof monies from Federal agencies. However, the guideline does not applyto such purchases if they are unrelated to or incidental to the Federalfunding, i.e., not the direct result of the grant, loan, or funds disbursement.An example of an insulation purchase unrelated or incidental to Federalfunding is where funds have been provided for public transit maintenanceand a new facility is built in which vehicles are repaired. The contractorconstructing the maintenance facility also builds a temporary on-site managementstructure. Any insulation purchases for the second structure are not subjectto the requirements in section 6002 or this guideline, even though someof the grant funds supporting the contract might be used to finance thepurchases.EPA solicits comments on whether this guideline should be revised to exemptblock grants from the section 6002 procurement requirements because itgenerally may not be possible to account separately for block grant fundsfrom non-Federal funds. EPA also solicits comments on whether this guidelineshould be revised to exempt block grants only when it is not possible toaccount separately for such funds.3. <T3>The $10,000 Threshold. </T3>RCRA section 6002(a) provides that therequirements of section 6002 apply: (1) When the purchase price of an itemexceeds $10,000 or (2) when the quantity of such items or of functionallyequivalent items purchased during the preceding fiscal year was $10,000or more. Thus, section 6002 clearly sets out a two-step procedure for determiningwhether the $10,000 threshold has been reached. First, a procuring agencymust determine whether it purchased $10,000 worth of building insulationproducts during the preceding fiscal year. If so, the requirements of section6002 apply to all building insulation purchases occurring in the currentfiscal year. Second, if a procuring agency did not procure $10,000 worthof building insulation products during the preceding fiscal year, it isnot subject to section 6002 unless it makes a $10,000 purchase of buildinginsulation products during the current fiscal year. The requirements ofsection 6002 then apply to the $10,000 purchase of building insulationproducts; to all subsequent purchases of building insulation products madeduring the current fiscal year, regardless of size; and to all procurementsof building insulation products made in the following fiscal year.Section 6002(a) does not provide that the procurement requirements aretriggered when the quantity of items purchased during the <T3>current </T3>fiscal year is $10,000 or more. EPA does not believe thatCongress intended to require procuring agenices to keep a running tallyof procurements of items designated by EPA. Maintaining such a runningtally would be very burdensome. Rather, procuring agencies only need tocompute their total procurements of building insulation products once atthe end of the fiscal year and only if they intend to claim an exemptionfrom the requirements of section 6002 in the following fiscal year.4. <T3>Functionally Equivalent Items. </T3>In common usage, the term insulationcovers many items manufactured to meet different uses and performance standards.EPA believes that restricting the applicability of section 6002 based ona vary narrow, technical definition of functional equivalency would limitthe effectiveness of the guideline in meeting the objectives of RCRA, becausean agency may purchase less than $10,000 of each type of building insulationproduct.EPA has concluded that, in the case of building insulation, ``functionallyequivalent'' items should be defined as a category of items having substantiallyor similar end use. This category, ``building insulation,'' will assurebroad applicability of this guideline. Further, building insulation typesdefined by design (such as loose-fill, blanket, board, and spray-in-place)and building insulation products defined by material content (such as fiberglass,cellulose, cellulose fiberboard, rock wool, rigid plastic foams, composites,and specialty materials) can be used almost interchangeably in ceilings,floors, foundations and walls. The choice of building insulation type andmaterial content is based on technical considerations that are site specific.Government procuring agencies rarely track building insulation purchasesas a line item and certainly do not distinguish between material typesor design types of building insulation products. EPA believes that theguideline will be more easily implemented by procuring agencies if alltypes of insulation used to resist heat flow within a building are includedwithin the single category of building insulation.Under andSection; 248.3(b) of the guideline, all of the following types ofinsulation are encompassed by the term ``building insulation'' and thereforeare ``functionally equivalent'' for purposes of the $10,000, threshold:andbullet; Loose-fill insulation, including but not limited to cellulosefiber, fiberglass, rock wool, vermiculite, and perlite;andbullet; Blanket and batt insulation, including but not limited to fiberglassand rock wool;andbullet; Board (sheathing, roof decking, wall panel) insulation, includingbut not limited to cellulose fiberboard, glass fiberboard, foam glass,polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, polystyrene, phenolics, and composites;andandbullet; Spray-in-place insulation, including but not limited to polyurethane,polyisoicyanurate and spray-on cellulose.D. DefinitionsMost of the definitions used in this proposed guideline are used in RCRAand therefore need no further explanation. Others are standard industryor purchsing definitions. A few are discussed in more detail in this sectionof the preamble to clarify the information that follows.1. <T3>Building Insulation. </T3>``Building insulation'' is defined as a material,primarily designed to resist heat flow, which is installed between theconditioned (heated and/or mechanically cooled) volume of a building andadjacent, unconditioned volumes or the outside. This term includes butis not limited to insulation products such as blanket, board, spray-in-place,and loose-fill. ``Building insulation'' is intended to cover all thermalinsulation products used in all types of structures with the exceptionof cold storage and pipe insulation. The phrase ``including but not limitedto'' in the insulation definitions is intended to insure that new typesof products will be included within the scope of the guideline as theyare developed.2. <T3>Practicable. </T3>Section 6002(c) requires procuring agencies to procureitems composed of the highest percentage of recovered materials <T3>practicable</T3> and section 6002(i) requires procuring agencies todevelop programs to assure that recovered materials are purchased to themaximum extent <T3>practicable </T3>(emphasis added). EPA defined ``practicable'' in thefinal paper guideline (52 FR 37297, October 6, 1987) and is including thedefinition in this proposed guideline for insulation products.EPA's definition of ``practicable'' combines the dictionary definitionwith certain statutory criteria for determining practicability. The dictionarydefinition of practicable is ``capable of being used,'' and EPA believesthat Congress intended the term to be defined in this way. Congress alsoprovided four criteria for determining the maximum amount practicable:(1) Performance in accordance with applicable specifications; (2) availabilityat a reasonable price; (3) availability within a reasonable period of time;and (4) maintenance of a satisfactory level of competition. EPA's definitionof practicable incorporates these criteria.3. <T3>Procurement Terms. </T3>To simplify the Federal purchasing process,``commercial item descriptions'' (CIDs), which reference industry standards,have generally replaced the multitude of individual insulation specificationspreviously used by Federal procurement agencies. When soliciting invitationsto bid, procuring agencies can stipulate special terms and conditions (suchas minimum content standards for recovered material content), in the ``invitationto bid'' or ``request for proposal'' documents. These phrases have beendefined by the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing as follows:andbullet; <T3>``Commercial Item Descriptions'' </T3>are series of simplified itemdescriptions under the Federal specifications-and-standards program usedin the acquisition of commercial off-the-self and commercial type products.andbullet; <T3>``Invitation For Bids (IFB)'' </T3>is the solicitation for prospectivesuppliers by a purchaser requesting their competitive price quotations.andbullet; <T3>``Request For Proposal (RFP)'' </T3>is a request for an offer by oneparty to another of terms and conditions with references to some work ofundertaking; the initial overture or preliminary statement for considerationby the other party to a proposed agreement.4. <T3>Insulation Terms. </T3>Definitions for terms relating to insulationare directly quoted or have been adapted from the Association of Testingand Materials (ASTM) and the Department of Energy's Residential ConservationService definitions, as they were available.As explained above, EPA was unable to determine whether any or all cellulosicfiberboards contain postconsumer recovered paper. Therefore, in this proposedguideline, EPA is using the term ``cellulose fiberboard'' to refer to fiberboardscontaining recovered paper. EPA solicits comments on use of this term.E. Requirements vs. Recommendations RCRA section 6002 requires procuring agencies and contracting officersto perform certain activities, such as revising specifications for procurementitems. It also requires EPA to prepare ``guidelines for the use of procuringagencies in complying with'' section 6002. EPA has incorporated the Section6002 requirements into the proposed guideline for the benefit of procuringagencies. As a result, the guideline contains two types of provisions:requirements (mandated by Congress in section 6002) and recommendations(EPA's guidance for complying with the requirements of section 6002). Asused in this guideline, the verbs ``shall'' and ``must'' indicate Section6002 requirements, while verbs such as ``recommend,'' ``should,'' and ``suggest''indicate recommendations for complying with those requirements. Procuring agencies must comply with the requirements of section 6002, whereasEPA's recommendations are only advisory in nature. Procuring agencies maychoose to use other approaches which satisfy the section 6002 requirements.However, EPA believes that if a procuring agency chooses to follow EPA'srecommendations, that agency will be in compliance with the section 6002requirements. F. Specifications Subpart B of the guideline, Specifications, contains two sections, Revisionsand Recommendations. 1. <T3>Revisions.</T3> a. <T3>Federal agencies.</T3> RCRA section 6002(d) contains two requirementsfor revising specifications for procurement items. First, Federal agenciesthat have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications forprocurement items procured by Federal agencies were required to revisetheir specifications, by May 8, 1986, to eliminate exclusions of recoveredmaterials and requirements that items be manufactured from virgin materials[section 6002(d)(1)]. Second, within one year after the date of publication of a guideline asa final rule, Federal agencies must assure that their specifications fordesignated items require the use of recovered materials to the maximumextent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item [section6002(d)(2)]. EPA believes that this second requirement is more extensivethan the first requirement. Simply eliminating discriminatory provisions,as required by section 6002(d)(1), is not sufficient to meet all the obligationsof section 6002(d). EPA believes, however, that compliance with the affirmativeprocurement requirements of section 6002(i) fulfills the section 6002(d)(2)requirements because an affirmative procurement program should result inprocurement to the maximum extent practicable. b. <T3>Procuring agencies.</T3> EPA believes that the second specificationrevision requirement also applies to non-Federal procuring agencies whichprocure building insulation products with appropriated Federal funds. Unlesstheir specifications (or purchasing practices with respect to buildinginsulation products) are revised to allow the use of recovered materialsin building insulation products, these agencies will be unable to implementthe affirmative procurement requirements of RCRA section 6002(c)(1) and(i). For this reason, andSection;andSection; 248.3 and 248.10(b) of the proposedguideline provide that all <T3>procuring agencies</T3> (rather than ``Federal agencies'' as providedin the Act) must assure that their specifications (or purchasing practices)for building insulation products require the use of recovered materialsto the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intended end useof these items. 2. <T3>Recommendations.</T3> In the early 1980s, the Federal government beganto use CIDs for insulation purchases, as they are available, rather thanspecifications written by each individual agency. CIDs are functional innature and as generic as possible to permit the maximum number of suppliersto bid for contracts. In general, ASTM and American Society of Heating,Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) specifications arereferenced. EPA has reviewed the materials requirements of the ASTM specificationsand finds that they neither allow nor disallow recovered material content.ASHRAE specifications tend to be test and performance standards, and thusdo not refer to specific material content. EPA has also reviewed specificationsused by Federal agencies. HUD programs reference minimum property standards,which currently refer to local building codes. Local building codes referencethe ASTM and ASHRAE specifications. DOE weatherization program specificationsthat deal with material content require conformance with equivalent ASTMspecifications. GSA referenced ASTM and DOD military specifications andcommercial item descriptions in 1986 procurements. The military specifications address the issue of recycled content in oneof two ways, depending on the specification. Either recycled content wasneither allowed nor disallowed in the material description or there wasa special clause requiring that recovered materials be used to the maximumextent practicable. Recovered materials was defined to mean ``materialswhich have been collected or recovered from solid waste and reprocessedto become a source of raw materials as opposed to virgin raw materials.None of the above shall be interpreted to mean that the use of used orrebuilt products is allowed * * *''. As previously discussed, all procuring agencies must assure that theirspecifications require the use of recovered materials content to the maximumextent possible without jeopardizing the end use of the item. If the useof CIDs and standard specifications over which procuring agencies haveno direct control continues, another method to assure maximum use of recoveredmaterial content in building insulation products must be employed. a. <T3>Use of commercial item descriptions.</T3> EPA believes that the useof industry standards and CIDs is an efficient procurement practice andtherefore recommends in andSection; 248.11(a) of the proposed guideline thatCommercial Item Descriptions and equivalent standards continue to be usedwhenever possible. However, the use of CIDs and industry standards doesnot absolve procuring agencies of the requirement to review specificationsto assure that recovered materials are used to the maximum extent possiblewithout jeopardizing the end use of the item. As CIDs or industry standardsare adopted, procuring agencies must review them thoroughly to be certainthat no unjustifiable discrimination against recovered materials exists.b. <T3>Use of invitations for bids and requests for proposals.</T3> Bids aresolicited by all procuring agencies through invitations for bids or requestsfor proposals. Although contractors buy a large portion of the insulationpurchased with appropriated Federal dollars as part of their work to buildor renovate structures, they do so under contracts which originate withIFBs or RFPs. Procuring agencies can fulfill their obligations under thespecification revision requirements of RCRA section 6002 by inserting preferencesfor building insulation with recovered material content in the specialterms and conditions section of their invitations for bids or requestsfor proposals. Therefore, EPA recommends in andSection; 248.11(b) of theproposed guideline that procuring agencies insert minimum content standardsor equivalent preferences for recovered materials content in building insulationin their invitations for bids or in their requests for proposals. c. <T3>Exclusion of products that do not meet performance standards.</T3>Certain building insulating products cannot be made with recovered materialscontent without jeopardizing performance standards. In general, this situationapplies to specialty materials and insulation items that must meet verystringent performance requirements. In most cases, EPA does not believethat such items will be offered to procuring agencies with recovered materialscontent. If such items are offered and found to fail performance tests,proposed andSection; 248.11(c) recommends that an agency document any findingthat, for a particular end-use, an item containing recovered materialscontent will not meet reasonable performance standards. The documentationshould reference the particular tests used to judge performance. Procuringagencies should also reference such documentation in subsequent solicitationsfor the specific item to avoid repetition of previously documented findings.d. <T3>New and adapted products.</T3> EPA believes that as new building insulationproducts enter the marketplace and as recycling technologies advance forfeedstocks used in insulation manufacture, additional types of buildinginsulation with recovered content will become available. EPA recommendsin andSection; 248.11(d) of the proposed guideline that procuring agenciesassure that language in new specifications for new building insulationproducts allows recovered materials content. EPA further recommends thatas new building insulation products containing recovered materials areidentified, the same approaches to procurement recommended in this guidelinefor existing products be inserted in invitations for bids and requestsfor proposals whenever the new products could be offered. The annual review procedure detailed in andSection; 248.24 of this guideline,the certification and estimation process detailed in andSection; 248.23,and the case-by-case procurement approach detailed in andSection; 248.21provide methods to monitor the introduction of recovered materials contentin building insulation products where such use may be developing. G. Affirmative Procurement Program RCRA section 6002(i) requires procuring agencies to adopt an affirmativeprocurement program to ensure that building insulation containing recoveredmaterials is purchased to the maximum extent practicable. The program mustcontain four elements: (1) A recovered materials preference program; (2)a promotion program; (3) procedures for estimation, certification, andverification of recovered materials content; and (4) procedures for annualreview and monitoring of the program's effectiveness. The program mustbe established within one year of the date of publication of this guidelineas a final rule. The following sections explain EPA's recommendations for each element ofthe affirmative procurement program. 1. <T3>Recovered Materials Preference Program.</T3> Under section 6002(i),procuring agencies have three options for implementing the preference program.They can employ a case-by-case approach, adopt minimum content standards,or choose an approach that is ``substantially equivalent'' to the precedingapproaches. The proposed guideline recommends that procuring agencies adoptminimum content standards for those building insulation products commerciallyavailable with recovered materials content. In those cases where the useof recovered materials content is technically feasible but not currentlycommercially available, or where building insulation products with recoveredmaterial content become unavailable, EPA recommends that the case-by-caseapproach be used. EPA notes that these approaches are <T3>recommended,</T3> not required. Procuring agencies may adopt ``substantiallyequivalent'' alternatives. However, EPA believes that if a procuring agencyfollows the recommendations, it will meet the requirements of RCRA. Procuringagencies that adopt other approaches must ensure that their preferenceprograms achieve the procurement of building insulation products ``withthe maximum percentage of recovered materials practicable''. The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the basis for theminimum content standards, including legal and technical considerations.a. <T3>Background.</T3> Considering the range of building insulation productscommercially available with recovered materials content, EPA believes thatthe use of minimum content standards is the most practical approach forthe procuring agencies to use. The minimum content standards approach wouldalso be the most effective way to insure that building insulation productsare purchased with the maximum percentage of recovered materials practicable,as required by RCRA sections 6002 (c) and (i). EPA is proposing to recommend minimum content standards for most typesof building insulation products. EPA believes that these minimum contentstandards are the highest that are currently practicable, and procuringagencies would therefore meet the requirements of section 6002 if the proposedminimum content standards are adopted. These standards are discussed furtherin section IV.G.1.d. EPA also recommends that the case-by-case approach be used but only ifthe availability of products with the standard minimum content becomesuncertain, or when it is not certain that products with recovered materialcontent have reached commercial distribution. This approach is discussedin Section IV.G.1.f. b. <T3>Alternatives considered. </T3>In addition to minimum content standardsand case-by-case procurement, EPA considered two other approaches for apreference program: price preferences and set-asides. As discussed in the final paper guideline, 52 FR 37298-37299 (October 6,1987), section 6002(i) requires that any affirmative procurement programbe consistent with applicable provisions of Federal procurement law. Fromtime to time, Congress has established preferential procurement programsin order to attain socioeconomic goals. Among those are the Small Business,Labor Surplus Area, and Minority Business procurement programs. EPA consideredapplying either or both of the mechanisms used in those programs_pricepreferences and set-asides_to this guideline. A price preference allowsthe procuring agency to pay a higher price, if necessary, for a specifiedproduct from preferred vendors. A set-aside requires the procuring agencyto award a certain percentage of its contracts to preferred vendors ofa product regardless of price. Price preferences and set-asides are currentlybeing used in some state programs for the procurement of paper and paperproducts containing recovered materials. As of January 1988, five statesand two cities use price preference programs in which products containingrecovered materials may cost from 5 to 10 percent more than virgin materials.Two states have set-aside programs, one for paper and paper products, theother for all types of products. These states report that they successfullyprocure products containing recovered materials. EPA has considered recommending these programs at the Federal level. Inthe case of existing Federal preferential procurement programs that allowa price preference or set-aside, the Agency found that each had been establishedunder explicit statutory authority or a specific Executive Order. Neitherthe statutory language nor the legislative history of section 6002 seems,however, to contemplate the adoption of either price preferences or set-asides,and doing so would conflict with existing Federal procurement regulations.Therefore, rather than recommending price preferences or set-asides, EPAis recommending that procuring agencies use the procurement mechanismsprovided in RCRA section 6002(i)(3). c. <T3>Legal considerations. </T3>RCRA section 6002(i)(1) requires that affirmativeprocurement programs be ``consistent with applicable Federal procurementlaw.'' EPA was concerned that minimum content standards might violate theCompetition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA) (10 USC Chapter 137) andthe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Ch. 1). Both provide thatspecifications restricting what can be offered by bidders are legally permissibleonly to the extent that they reflect the Government's minimum needs orare authorized by law. [CICA 2711(a)(2), 48 CFR 10.002(a)(3)(ii).] EPAhas concluded that RCRA section 6002 provides the necessary authorization.See 52 FR 38844 (October 19, 1987). Section 6002(i)(3)(B) expressly permitsagencies to establish specifications which restrict bids to those whichmeet a minimum content standard. Therefore, minimum content standards arenot in violation of general Federal procurement law. CICA requires agencies to use full and open competitive procedures whenprocuring property and services. The term ``full and open competition''means that all responsible sources must be permitted to submit a bid. Inthe case of a procurement against a restrictive specification, such asa minimum content standard, ``full and open competition'' means that allresponsible sources who can meet the specification can bid. The preferenceprogram recommendation in the proposed guideline is consistent with thisrequirement, since any vendor of building insulation can submit a bid aslong as the product offered contains the minimum recovered content. d. <T3>The minimum content recommendations. </T3>RCRA provides four criteriafor establishing a minimum content standard. Section 6002(i)(3)(B) providesthat the minimim content required by a specification must be the maximumavailable without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item or violatingthe limitations of section 6002(c)(1) (A) through (C). Thus, the four criteriaare (1) the intended end use of the item, (2) availability, (3) technicalperformance, and (4) price. For the items designated by this proposed guideline, the criteria are satisfiedby setting the minimum content standards at levels which do not interferewith the technical performance of the items and therefore the intendedend uses. In general, the use of recovered materials content within thetechnical limitations is cost-effective in insulation production, regardlessof the type. The third criterion, availability, will be the determiningfactor. There is a possibility, though not a probability, that industriesother than insulation may eventually absorb most of the available suppliesof recovered materials suitable for certain types of building insulation(e.g., slag). Should that occur, the case-by-case approach described belowcan be used until it is certain that market stimulation for the recoveredmaterial is no longer needed. EPA believes that minimum content standards can be set most efficientlyby the material type of the building insulation product. While there arevariations in the technically acceptable levels of recovered materialscontent among the myriad types of building insulation products within mostmaterial types, they are not wide enough to warrant a separate minimumcontent standard for each building insulation item. EPA is proposing to recommend in andSection;248.21(b)(3) of the guidelinethat procuring agencies adopt the minimum content standards in Table 5for all types of building insulation products made with the respectivetypes of material. The proposed standards are based on the core insulationmaterial, disregarding the facings, bindings, or any materials surroundingor attached to the insulation core. (These other materials vary very widelyfrom one insulation products to another and would interfere with meaningfulminimum content standards.) The proposed minimum content standards wouldalso apply to the portion(s) of the respective insulation material(s) thatis used in composite products. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,r50 </C><T4>Table </T4>5._<T4>Minimum Content Standards for Recovered Materials in Building InsulationProducts </T4><H1>Material type </H1><H1>Percent by weight</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on <D>75% postconsumer recovered paper. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cellulose fiberboard <D>50% postconsumer recovered paper. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perlite composite board <D>23% postconsumer recovered paper. </D></ITAG>Polyisocyanurate/polyurethane: <ITAG tagnum="2">Rigid foam <D>9% recovered material. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Foam-in-place <D>5% recovered material. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenolic rigid foam <D>4% recovered material. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rock wool <D>50% recovered material. </D><F/><T4>Note: </T4>The minimum content standards are based on the weight ofmaterial in the insulating core only.</ITAG></ITAG> For other building insulation products, EPA recommends that procuring agenciesuse the case-by-case approach as discussed in section IV.G.1.f. below.Each of the proposed minimum content standards has been set based on technicalconstraints in the manufacturing processes used in 1988. EPA solicits commentson the appropriateness of these standards or specific alternatives to thesestandards. The following subsections discuss the proposed minimum content standards.i. <T3>Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on insulation. </T3>The principal feedstockfor cellulose loose-fill and spray-on insulation is waste paper. In thecase of spray-on insulation, the minimum content standard is applied tothe insulating feedstock prior to the addition of adhesives. Section 6002(i((2) states that ``in the case of paper, the recovered materialspreference program required * * * shall provide for the maximum use ofthe post consumer recovered materials * * *'' Postconsumer waste paper,primarily old newspaper, is not only technically acceptable in celluloseinsulation, it is most frequently used. A variety of chemical additives are also combined with the fibers to retardflammability and to deter pests. The chemical additives are required tomeet the performance standards that have been established for this industry.The ratio of fiber to chemicals is 75 to 25. A higher percentage of wastepaper fiber could jeopardize the performance of the end use product formany manufacturers. For these reasons, EPA is proposing to recommend a75 percent postconsumer recovered paper minimum content standard for celluloseinsulation. EPA believes that this percentage will provide the maximumamount practicable. ii. <T3>Cellulose fiberboard. </T3>One of the principal feedstocks of cellulosefiberboard is postconsumer recovered paper, including old newspapers, mixedpaper, and corrugated. Although at least one company produces a productwith 100 percent postconsumer recovered paper, this is not true of allmanufacturers. It is not apparent that all cellulose fiberboards couldbe made with only paper. Different structural properties and finishes ofthe various types of cellulose fiberboard also make it inappropriate toset the minimum content standard at such a high level. Therefore, EPA proposesa minimum content standard of 50 percent postconsumer recovered paper forthis product. Although all cellulose fiberboard products may not currentlymeet this percentage, and some currently exceed it, it is the highest percentagepracticable within the overall industry. iii. <T3>Perlite composite board. </T3>The range of products in this type ofinsulation is made with various formulations of expanded perlite aggregate,selected binders, and old newspapers. The newspaper component is 23 percentto 30 percent. Although an increase in the newspaper component would beeconomically advantageous to the manufacturer, it would interfere withperformance requirements in individual products. EPA therefore proposesto set the recommended minimum percentage at 23 percent postconsumer recoveredpaper. iv. <T3>Polyisocyanurate/polyurethane (PIR/PU) rigid foam board insulation.</T3>The proposed minimum recovered materials content standard for thePIR/PU rigid foams applies only to the total feedstocks in the core materials.However, only the polyol fraction contains recovered materials; therefore,the minimum content standard cannot be very high. Recovered materials arenot available for the other components. The terms polyisocyanurate andpolyurethane are often used interchangeably, whether accurately or not.Further, the range of formulations in Table 6 is used within the industryto achieve special characteristics for different end use products. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L2(0),p0,7/8,i1,s25 </C><T4>Table 6._Components of Polyisocyanurate and Polyurethane Rigid Foam</T4><H1> </H1>53-57% isocyanate.20-30% aromatic polyester polyol.15-20% blowing agent.2-3% surfactants and catalysts.</ITAG> As discussed above, there are also two types of recovered materials usedin entirely different processes to make polyol, chemical bottoms (DMT andpossibly phthalic anhydride) and PET plastic scrap. Based on informationin the EPA data base and indications from manufacturers, EPA has concludedthat DMT and phthalic anhydride waste bottoms qualify as recovered materialsunder the RCRA definition. EPA requests comments on this conclusion toinclude these chemical bottoms within the recovered materials definitionand therefore within the scope of this guideline. The constraints to increasing the minimum content standard are common toboth types of recovered materials. Polyols with higher percentages of recoveredmaterials have characteristics that inhibit the flow of the liquid, foamingmass prior to the hardening of the mass into rigid cells. This would haveadverse affects on the performance characteristics of the finished products.Further, the PIR/PU rigid foam industry, including all the feedstock suppliers,is currently experimenting with blowing agents other than chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs). These substitute blowing agents are not as efficient as CFCs. Largerquantities by weight may be necessary in the product mixes and would thereforechange the relative percentage of polyol. EPA has taken the second constraintinto consideration in proposing to set the minimum recovered materialscontent standard at 9 percent, the highest percentage possible for thelowest percentage of PET-based polyol in the range of product formulations.To avoid confusion in terms and the application of minimum content standardsto individual products, one minimum content standard, 9 percent, is proposedfor all board products. EPA believes that this percentage will providethe maximum amount practicable.v. <T3>Polyisocyanurate/polyurethane foam-in-place insulation. </T3>The proposedminimum content standard for PIR/PU foam-in-place insulation applies tothe total feedstocks. However, only the polyester polyol fraction containsrecovered materials. This type of PIR/PU foam has two sub-categories, pour-in-placeand spray-in-place. It is premixed, with a shelf-life of six months. Formulationswith more than 30 percent polyester in the polyol fraction break down inless than six months, and viscosity is seriously impaired. The percentagesof ingredients is shown in Table 7. The other ingredients also vary comparedwith PIR/PU board. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L0,p0,7/8,g1,t1,i1,4,r10,4 </C><T4>Table </T4>7._<T4>Components of PIR/PU Foam-in-Place </T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">40%<D/> Isocyanate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40% <D/>Polyol. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> <D> 30%</D><D>oi1</D>Polyether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> <D> 70%</D><D>oi1</D>Polyether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20% <D/>Blowing agent.</ITAG></ITAG> As with aromatic polyester polyols for PIR/PU board products, the recoveredDMT or PET is reacted with glycol in similar ratios. The same constraintsregarding the eventual change from CFC to another blowing agent also applyto the PIR/PU foam-in-place products. EPA therefore proposes to set therecommended minimum content standard at 5 percent for PIR/PU foam-in-placerigid foam. vi. <T3>Phenolic rigid foam insulation. </T3>The only component of phenolicrigid foam insulation that can contain recovered materials is the aromaticpolyester polyol which is used in small quantities as a plasticizer. Theproduct formulations vary according to specific product and manufacturer,and are expressed in ranges to protect competitive information. The polyolfraction is said to be 3 percent to 10 percent of the total. The mixtureof glycol to DMT or PET differs from the PIR/PU foams when it is used inphenolics as a plasticizer. The ratio is 10 parts glycol to 90 parts otheringredients. Manufacturers recommend 4 percent as the highest practicableminimum content standard for phenolics. This represents approximately 4.5percent polyol in the total product mix. There are two technical constraints to setting a higher minimum contentstandard based on the use of polyol. First, larger percentages of polyolused as a plasticizer produce an end product that is too soft for commercialapplication with mechanized roofing equipment. Second, manufacturers needleeway in product formulations for different product types and to accommodatepotential changes in blowing agents. Therefore, EPA is proposing a 4 percentminimum content standard for phenolic rigid foam insulation. vii. <T3>Rock wool insulation. </T3>The rock wool industry uses either metallurgicalslags or natural rock to make rock wool fiber. Although some manufacturersare entirely dependent on slag as feedstock, this is not true in certainparts of the country, where good quality metallurgical slags are no longereasily available. EPA believes that the only constraint to setting a higherminimum content standard is the availability of the recovered materialfeedstock. EPA considered geographic availability of rock wool insulationwhen proposing to set the recommended minimum recovered material contentstandard at 50 percent. EPA believes that this percentage will providethe maximum amount practicable. e. <T3>Limitations set by RCRA. </T3>As mentioned above, the proposed minimumcontent standard would be subject to the four limitations provided in RCRAsection 6002, namely, not jeopardizing the intended end use of the product,reasonable availability, reasonable price, and ability to meet the specifications.Procuring agencies must also be able to maintain a reasonable level ofcompetition. For example, if a procuring agency determines that it cannotobtain a type of building insulation containing the minimum amount of recoveredcontent or that it cannot obtain the insulation at a reasonable price,or that an insufficient number of bids can be obtained to meet competitionrequirements, the procuring agency can re-evaluate the minimum contentstandard. Lower minimum content standards can be tested for the particulartype of insulation product. Section 248.21(c) of the proposed guidelineprovides that the recommended procurement approaches, or any other approachused by a procuring agency, are subject to the RCRA limitations. f. <T3>Case-by-case procurement. </T3>For procurement of building insulation,the case-by-case approach means that bids are to be solicited for the selectedtype of insulation with an unspecified percentage of recovered materialscontent. In other words, bidders may offer building insulation productsmade with recovered materials content from 1 percent to 100 percent ofthe total product or made entirely with virgin materials. The contractwould be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. In thecase of otherwise identical low bids, preference would be granted to thevendor offering the insulation product with the highest percentage of recoveredcontent. According to section 6002(i)(3)(A) of RCRA, ``subject to the limitationsof subsection (c)(1)(A)-(C), agencies may make an award to a vendor offeringitems with less than the minimum content standard.''The case-by-case approach allows procuring agencies to attract bids forbuilding insulation products with less than the minimum recovered materialcontent standard when items containing the minimum content are not available.The case-by-case approach also allows procuring agencies to express a preferencefor recovered material content in building insulation products when suchproducts are being considered for commercial production.EPA is proposing to recommend in andSection; 248.21(b)(2)(i) of the guidelinethat procuring agencies use the case-by-case approach when there is informationthat a building insulation product can technically be made with recoveredmaterial content but is not commercially available. The best current examplesare polystryrene and fiberglass. As previously discussed, industry sourceshave suggested that polystyrene insulation containing recovered materialsis technically feasible. Consequently, the Agency has included polystyreneinsulation within the scope of the proposed guideline. There are indicationsthat research and development efforts are underway to introduce recoveredmaterials into polystyrene insulation products. EPA solicits comments onthe availability, price, and performance of all types of polystyrene insulationmade with any percentage of recovered material.In the case of fiberglass insulation, the use of recovered materials isprimarily constrained by the availability of recovered material feedstocks.The case-by-case approach would also be useful to gather information onnew types of building insulation materials as they enter commercial distribution.EPA is further proposing to recommend in andSection; 248.21(b)(2) (ii) ofthe guideline that the case-by-case approach be used when building insulationproducts become unavailable with the minimum content standard for recoveredmaterials. An example would be rock wool insulation if supplies of metallurgicalslags become unavailable.g. <T3>Procurement procedures. </T3>Procuring agencies should examine theirprocedures and eliminate any procurement practice that discriminates againstrecovered materials content in building insulation products. For instance,invitations to bid a broad range of insulation products on an ``all ornone basis'' may exclude suppliers of insulation with recovered contentthat can only supply a limited range of items. In andSection; 248.21(e) ofthe proposed guideline, EPA recommends that procuring agencies eliminatethis and any similar forms of discrimination.2. <T3>Promotion Program. </T3>The second requirement of the affirmative procurementprogram is a promotional effort by procuring agencies. Proposed andSection;248.22 of the guideline would recommend several methods for procuring agenciesto use for disseminating information about their preference programs, suchas placing statements in invitations to bid, discussing the program atbidders' conferences, informing industry trade associations about the program,providing information about building insulation made with recovered materialsin the product information programs sponsored by the Department of Housingand Urban Development, and issuing press releases discussing the affirmativeprocurement program to recycling industry publications.Under section 521 of the National Housing Act, HUD is required to provideproduct-related services and publications. These should be used as avenuesto publicize recovered materials content in insulation. HUD publicationsinclude:andbullet; National Building Codesandbullet; Bulletins andbullet; Materials releasesandbullet; Engineering bulletinsandbullet; Use of materials informationEPA is proposing to recommend that procuring agencies use all such avenuesto publicize their requirements for recovered material content in buildinginsulation products.3. <T3>Estimation, Certification, and Verification. </T3>The third requirementof the affirmative procurement program set forth in section 6002(i) coversestimation, certification, and verification of recovered material contentin procurements. Estimates and certifications of content in an item aremost easily expressed as a percentage of total content and can range from0 percent to 100 percent, depending on the type of product or the feedstockused in manufacturing the item. Many issues have been raised about theserequirements, such as when the information should be provided, who is toprovide it, and how it is to be obtained. To clarify this subject, it isnecessary to review the requirements of the statute.a. <T3>Estimation. </T3>RCRA section 6002(c)(3)(B) and section 6002(i)(2)(C)require that, after the effective date of a guideline, vendors that supplyprocuring agencies with products covered by the guideline also must providean <T3>estimate </T3>of the total percentage of recovered materials utilizedin the performance of the contract. Furthermore, contracting officers mustrequire that this information be provided.EPA believes that this requirement is for the purpose of gathering statisticalinformation on price, quantity, availability, and performance of productsmade from recovered materials. EPA further believes that this requirementapplies regardless of the approach used when a contract is solicited orawarded (i.e., minimum content standards, case-by-case procurement, oran equivalent alternative). Estimates may differ from percentages of minimumrecovered content specified in certifications and will provide up-to-dateinformation for the annual review which is required of procuring agencies.Proposed andSection; 248.23(a) would require that contracting officers requirevendors to provide estimates of the total percentage of recovered contentin building insulation products. Note that the percentage of recoveredcontent refers to the total content of the insulation <T3>core </T3>rather than the entire insulation product, which includesother items such as facings or bindings. EPA is proposing to recommendthat procuring agencies retain these data for three years by type of product,quantity purchased, and price paid.b. <T3>Certification. </T3>The use of certifications is common in governmentprocurement. It is written assurance that goods or services delivered willfulfill the specified requirements. Failure to meet the conditions whichhave been certified can result in penalties to a vendor. RCRA Section 6002(c)(3)(A)requires that after the effective date of this guideline, vendors must``certify that the percentage of recovered materials to be used in theperformance of the contract will be at least the amount required by applicablespecifications or other contractual requirements''. RCRA section 6002(i)(2)(C)requires ``certification of minimum recovered material content actuallyutilized * * *.''Together, these sections could be interpreted to mean that multiple certificationswill be required; one when bids are offered, and another with each shipment.This issue was addressed in the paper guideline issued October 6, 1987(52 FR 37300). EPA concluded that one certification would fulfill bothstatutory requirements and, by requiring the certification no matter whichapproach is used, procuring agencies could adapt their purchasing programsmost easily. For the same reasons enunicated in the paper guideline, EPAis proposing to recommend in andSection; 248.23(b) that procuring agenciesmeet the certification requirement in RCRA sections 6002(c)(3)(A) and 6002(i)(2)(C)by using a single certification when bids are offered.Note that there is no requirement to certify the actual recovered content,but rather that the recovered content actually used meets the contractminimum. When minimum content standards are used, the contract minimumis the standard specified in the solicitation or invitation for bid. Whencase-by-case procurement is used, the contract minimum is the minimum asspecified in the offer provided in response to the solicitation or IFB.Accordingly, EPA recommends that procuring agencies require certificationas a condition of a responsive bid when bids are offered, regardless ofwhether the case-by-case, minimum content standard, or a substantiallyequivalent approach is used. Also, as previously stated, the successfulvendor must estimate the actual recovered content in building insulationproducts that are supplied. The estimate may or may not be different thanthe minimum percentage that is certified.EPA understands that for both estimation and certification, the vendorwill not have direct knowledge of recovered materials content. Only themanufacturer that produces the insulation product will have that information.However, there is no direct authority in RCRA section 6002 for the Federalgovernment to require this information from anyone but the vendor. Therefore,vendors must make their own arrangements for obtaining this informationfrom manufacturers.c. <T3>Verification. </T3>Procuring agencies also are required to establish``reasonable verification procedures for estimates and certifications.''See RCRA section 6002(i)(2)(C). If these verification procedures includeaccess to manufacturers' records, then the procuring agency must use someauthority other than RCRA to inspect these records or must require vendorsto have an agreement with the manufacturer to supply such information oraccess to the procuring agency.In general, insulation manufacturers maintain records of the feedstocksused in each ``batch'' for their own internal quality and specificationcontrols. The optimum mix or recovered and virgin materials often remainsthe same for each type of insulation though variations may occur in individualbatches.In most cases, manufacturers will be able to provide a certification tovendors as to the specific feedstock content of the product shipped toa customer. It is not intended that the guideline require any additionalrecords to be kept by the manufacturers; records normally kept should becomplete enough to estimate or certify to recovered materials content accurately.However, to simplify the verification procedure and accommodate variationsdictated by quality control and supply, the average of recovered materialsused in each specific product over a one-month period may be used, if necessary,to meet the verification of estimates requirement.EPA is proposing to recommend in andSection; 248.23(c)(2) that one-monthfigures be used for estimates of feedstock percentages. If it is necessaryto verify the exact content of a specific batch of insulation, the manufacturers'records for that batch can then be consulted.However, if the vendor knows that the recovered materials content of aninsulation product supplied to procuring agencies differs from the monthlyaverage, then the average cannot be used. For example, if the monthly averageis 30 percent recovered materials content but the insulation product suppliedcontains no recovered materials or conversely contains 60 percent recoveredcontent, then the vendor cannot use the monthly average. Use of the averagein such instances will be viewed as an attempt to circumvent the requirementsof RCRA in supplying insulation products to the procuring agency.Monthly <T3>averages </T3>cannot be used for certification. Every shipment maynot contain recovered materials content equal to or greater than the average.However, the <T3>minimum </T3>percentage of recovered materials used in insulation productsby the manufacturer can be determined from monthly records for certificationpurposes.It has been suggested that the various insulation industries are very competitiveand that the ``recipes'' for various insulation products are carefullyguarded trade secrets. However, the special ingredients that distinguishone manufacturer's product from another's are used in very small quantities.The volumes of virgin and recovered material feedstocks in question arefar larger and are the only feedstocks for which verification procedureswould be necessary. EPA is proposing to recommend in andSection; 248.23(c)(1)that, should it be necessary to consult manufacturers' records for verification,records of other ingredients should not be reviewed in order to protecttrade secrets.4. <T3>Annual Review and Monitoring. </T3>The fourth requirement of the affirmativeprocurement program is an annual review and monitoring of the effectivenessof the program. EPA is proposing to recommend that the review include anestimate of the quantity of building insulation products purchased duringthe year, an assessment of the effectiveness of the agency promotion program,and an assessment of any remaining barriers to procurement of buildinginsulation containing recovered materials. In assessing barriers to procurement,procuring agencies should determine whether they are internal or external.Internal barriers, such as resistance to use of building insulation withrecovered content by agency personnel, without cause, can be correctedby the procuring agencies. External barriers, such as unavailability ofbuilding insulation with recovered content, may well be beyond the agencies'control.EPA also believes that procuring agencies should review the range of estimatesand certifications of recovered materials content provided by vendors duringthe year. Significant and repeated variations between standards, certificationsand estimates would signal whether changes in approach (e.g., from case-by-caseto minimum content standards) or different minimum content standards arewarranted. EPA further believes that information provided by the estimationrequirement will be particularly helpful to procuring agencies when theyreview their compliance with the requirement to purchase building insulationproducts with the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable.EPA has determined that one intent of the requirement that vendors estimatethe total percentage of recovered materials content is to provide informationto procuring agencies that can be used in future procurements. Further,procuring agencies need to keep up-to-date on changes in recycling practicesand availability of products containing recovered materials content. Forthese reasons, EPA believes that agencies should keep statistical recordsof building insulation product procurements to implement properly the intentof Congress in requiring an affirmative procurement program. A summaryof these records should be included in the annual review and monitoringof the effectiveness of the program.A program for gathering statistics need not be elaborate to be effective.However, agencies should monitor their procurements to provide data onthe following:(a) The percentages of recovered materials content in the products procuredor offered;(b) Comparative price information on competitive procurements;(c) The quantity of each item procured over a fiscal year;(d) The availability of the insulation products to procuring agencies;(e) Type of performance tests conducted, together with the categories ofbuilding insulation products containing recovered materials content thatfailed the tests, the percentage of total virgin products and productscontaining recovered materials content supplied that failed each test,and the nature of the failure;(f) Agency experience with the performance of the procured products.Rather than keep records of each test performed, procuring agencies shouldidentify the performance tests used and maintain records, by test, on thepercentage of failures by building insulation products containing recoveredmaterials content and on the nature of these failures.EPA recommends that each procuring agency prepare a report on its annualreview and monitoring of the effectiveness of its procurement program.If the agency is using the case-by-case approach, the report should discusshow that approach is maximizing the use of recovered materials contentas required by RCRA section 6002. If the minimum content standard approachis used, the agency should discuss whether the standard should be raised,lowered, or remain constant for each item. The discussion should be basedon reasonable determinations of price, quality, and availability as wellas a comparison of estimates and certifications provided by the vendors.Agencies should also document their review of specifications and list thosewhich are revised each year.EPA notes that this guideline will apply to state and local procuring agenciesas explained under ``Applicability.'' Information drawn from the experienceof Federal procuring agencies about purchases of insulation products containingrecovered materials content would therefore be useful to state and localpurchasing officials. Accordingly, EPA encourages Federal procuring agenciesto make their reports available to the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Price, Competition, Availability, and Performance</ITAG>As described above, Section 6002(c)(1) of RCRA provides that a procuringagency may decide not to purchase an item designated by EPA if it determinesthat the item is available only at an unreasonable price, a satisfactorylevel of competition cannot be maintained, the item is not reasonably availablewithin a reasonable period of time, or the item fails to meet the performancestandards. EPA has considered the effect of these limitations on insulationcontaining recovered material content procurement.A. PriceSeveral factors will affect the market price, or bid price, of the designatedinsulation products, including the availability and cost of recovered materialfeedstocks, transportation costs, and so on. Becuase these factors canbe site specific and are variable, EPA believes the best method of determiningthe price is through the marketplace. Further, fluctuation in the overalleconomy affects the prices of individual insulation products.In many cases, more than one type of insulation could be selected for aparticular installation. The different types of insulation do not competeon pricing alone; otherwise the least expensive insulation product wouldbe used in all instances. There is no purchasing history based on relativeprices of insulation products made with virgin versus recovered materialcontent. The only price comparison EPA could make is by type of insulationmade with virgin materials or with recovered materials content at a particularpoint in time. The price differences may be the result of factors otherthan recovered material content, such as special additives or featuresin one product as compared with another.Further, manufacturers have suggested that the use of recovered materialsrather than virgin materials rarely results in price differences. Celluloseand rock wool insulation is rarely available with primarily virgin content.Cellulose fiberboard and the polyisocyanurate/polyurethane rigid foamsare commonly, though not always, made with recovered materials. Price differencesbetween similar products are usually the result of factors unrelated tothe choice of virgin or recycled feedstocks.Each procuring agency may decide whether or not a ``reasonable price''includes a price preference. As EPA stated in the paper guideline, 52 FR37298-37299 (October 6, 1987), RCRA section 6002 does not provide explicitauthority to EPA to authorize or recommend repayment of a price preferenceor to create a set-aside. Therefore, unless an agency has an independentauthority to provide a price preference or to create a set-aside, EPA believesthat a price is ``unreasonable'' if it is greater than the price of a competingproduct made of virgin material.However, it should be borne in mind that, when product specifications requirea recovered material content, there is no way to guarantee that every itemprocured under those specifications was procured at a price no greaterthan the price that would have been paid in the absence of those specifications.On the contrary, EPA expects that there will be fluctuations in price inboth directions. Therefore, EPA interprets the reasonable price provisionof RCRA section 6002(c)(1)(C) for those specifications to mean that thereis no projected or observed long-term or average increase over the priceof comparable virgin items.B. CompetitionEPA recommends that determinations of ``satisfactory'' competition be madein accordance with Federal procurement law. For example, 48 CFR Part 14,Sealed Bidding, allows for award of bids even when a small number of bidshave been received; see 48 CFR 14.407-1. In the case of negotiated contracts,48 CFR 15.804-3(b) provides that competition exists if offers are solicited;two or more responsible offerors that can satisfy the Government's requirementssubmit price offers responsive to the solicitation's expressed requirements;and these offerors compete independently for a contract to be awarded tothe responsible offeror submitting the lowest evaluated price.EPA believes that the number of manufacturers for the designated typesof building insulation products is sufficient to assure competitive bidding.Further, many vendors are able to bid products from a single manufacturer.EPA does not foresee insufficient competition for building insulation productsmade with recovered materials content. If a lack of competition resultsbecause of the recommended minimum content standards, EPA is proposingto recommend that procuring agencies re-evaluate the minimum content standards.C. AvailabilityEPA believes that the building insulation products designated in the proposedguideline published today are currently available with recovered materialscontent in each of the following insulation categories: cellulose, cellulosefiberboard, perlite composite board, rock wool, polyurethane/polyisocyanuraterigid foam-in-place and board, and phenolic rigid foam. Although statisticson recovered material feedstock use have not been gathered for any typeof building insulation product, both manufacturers and suppliers of recyclablefeedstocks have indicated the flow of recovered materials into the insulationindustries. Fiberglass insulation made with recovered cullet is not aswidely available, and polystyrene insulation made with recovered materialsmay only be in developmental stages.In the case of fiberglass insulation, EPA has determined that fiberglassis frequently available with manufacturer's waste cullet, but the percentagesare not consistent batch to batch nor among different manufacturers. Currentlythere is more demand for both preconsumer and postconsumer cullet thanthere are available supplies. Although EPA has determined that cullet isa technically acceptable feedstock which is used by the fiberglass industrywhen it is available in constant quantities at competitive prices, thecompetition for bottle cullet from the glass container industry and forother types of preconsumer glass cullet from other industries makes itimpractical to recommend a minimum cullet content standard for the fiberglassindustry. However, these circumstances may change over time. ThereforeEPA is proposing that procuring agencies use the case-by-case approachto purchase fiberglass insulation with recovered material content at thistime.Although EPA has not confirmed the use of recovered materials in polystyreneinsulation, manufacturers have indicated that research and developmentefforts are underway. EPA therefore proposes that procuring agencies adopta case-by-case approach for polystyrene insulation. This approach wouldprovide the information necessary for the affirmative preference programrequired by Section 6002, without jeopardizing current procurements.New types of insulation products may become available with recovered materialscontent. Procuring agencies can identify such new products and adaptationsto existing products as they monitor new developments. These additionalproducts must be included in the preference program as they become available.D. PerformanceIn general, performance standards for building insulation products havebeen established without regard to the kind of feedstocks used. Manufacturershave indicated that the use of recovered materials rather than virgin feedstocksdoes not affect the performance of the insulation product in question.Performance is determined by other factors. Standard industry specificationsfor all but cellulose loose-fill insulation neither allow nor disallowrecovered material content; cellulose loose-fill insulation specificallymentions that the basic materials is to be recycled. In many other typesof insulation products, recovered material is commonly used. Therefore,EPA does not believe that product performance should be an issue of concernto procuring agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Implementation</ITAG>Different parts of section 6002 refer to different dates by which procuringagencies must have completed or initiated a required activity: (1) May8, 1986 (i.e., 18 months after enactment of HSWA), (2) one year after thedate of publication of an EPA guideline, and (3) the date specified inan EPA guideline. As a result, there is some confusion with respect towhich activities must be completed or initiated by each date. This sectionof the preamble explains these requirements.First, under section 6002(d)(1), Federal agencies that have the responsibilityfor drafting or reviewing specifications for procurement items were toeliminate from such specifications any exclusion of recovered materialsand any requirements that items be manufactured from virgin materials.This activity was to be completed by May 8, 1986.Second, procuring agencies must assure that their specifications for procurementitems designated by EPA require the use of recovered materials to the maximumextent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item [section6002(d)(2)]. In addition, procuring agencies must develop an affirmativeprocurement program for purchasing designated items, in this instance,building insulation products [section 6002(i)(1)]. Both of these activitiesmust be completed within one year after the date of publication of thisguideline as a final rule.Third, procuring agencies which procure items designated by EPA must procuresuch items containing the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable[section 6002(c)(1)]. In addition, contracting officers must require vendorsto submit estimates and certifications of recovered materials content [section6002(c)(3)]. Both of these activities must begin after the date specifiedby EPA in the applicable guideline. EPA believes that procuring agenciesshould begin to procure the designated products as soon as the specification(or purchasing practice) revisions have been completed and the affirmativeprocurement programs have been developed. Since these latter activitiesmust be completed within one year after publication of this guideline asa final rule, affirmative procurement should begin no later than one yearfrom publication as well. Section 248.26 specifies this implementationdate.EPA expects cooperation from affected procuring agencies in implementingthis guideline. Under section 6002(g) of RCRA, the Office of Federal ProcurementPolicy (OFPP), in cooperation with EPA, is responsible for overseeing implementationof the requirements of section 6002 and for coordinating it with otherFederal procurement policies. OFPP is required to report to Congress onactions taken by Federal agencies to implement section 6002.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Summary of Supporting Analyses</ITAG>A. GeneralThree background documents were prepared for EPA and have been placed inthe docket for the proposed guideline: <T3>Feasibility of a Procurement Guideline for Recovered Materials in InsulationProducts</T3> (E.H. Pechan andamp; Associates, Inc., February, 1988), <T3>Insulating Material Types and Manufacturers </T3>(E.H. Pechan andamp;Associates, Inc., June 1988), and <T3>Energy and Economic Impacts of the Proposed Guideline for Procurementof Building Insulation Products Containing Recovered Materials </T3>(E.H.Pechan andamp; Associates, Inc., June 1988).B. <T3>Environmental Impacts</T3>Recently questions have arisen regarding the environmental consequencesof use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the manufacture of various items.One of the types of insulation covered by the proposed guideline, rigidplastic foams, contain CFCs. EPA is currently pursuing research and examiningthe regulatory issues.Ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere has created environmental concerns.Fully halogenated CFCs are the primary suspects for causing substantialozone depletion. EPA published a proposed rule on Protection of StratosphericOzone (40 CFR Part 82) on December 14, 1987 (52 FR 47486). The regulationswould reduce consumption of CFCs and halons, are intended to reduce therelease of CFCs and halons to the atmosphere, and would implement the Montrealprotocols. The deadline for final EPA regulations is August, 1988.CFCs are a key ingredient of PIR/PU, extruded PS, and phenolic rigid foaminsulations. PIR/PU rigid foam insulation uses CFC-11 (fluorotrichloromethane).Extruded PS foam insulation is manufactured with CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane).CFCs are used as a supplementary blowing agent and are retained withinthe closed insulation cells. CFCs have good thermal insulation propertiesand contribute significantly to the high R-values of the rigid foam insulations.Use of CFCs in closed cell foams has changed the emissions scenario fromone of quick release (such as aerosol propellants) to a steady, very longterm release. Industry sources have informally suggested that the halflives of CFCs in one-inch thick un-clad polyisocyanurate foam boards range75 to 150 years.Expandable foam polystyrene (EPS) is not made with CFCs. Instead, hydrocarbonssuch as pentane are used as blowing agents. R-values for equivalent thicknessesof EPS when compared with extruded polystyrene are said to be lower.Insulation, by nature, is installed in the broadest range of building applicationsand geographies. Therefore, release of CFCs cannot be effectively controlled.Continued, and increasing use of CFCs in PIR/PU and extruded PS insulationas market share grows would effectively create a bank of CFCs slowly beingreleased throughout the environment.Unlike many other uses of CFCs, there are no currently available substitutesfor PIR/PU and extruded PS rigid foam insulation. A substitute must interactsuitably with the other chemical feedstocks, function as a supplementaryblowing agent and also have superior thermal insulating properties. A substitutecannot be toxic in itself nor increase toxicities or flammability of theinsulation product. The industry is faced with potential EPA CFC consumptionreduction controls that could seriously impact manufacturers of this typeof insulation. Consequently, research for a commercial substitute is beingpursued aggressively.EPA has not determined that the use of recovered materials content hasany effect on use of chlorofluorocarbons and therefore solicits commentson this issue.C. Energy ImpactsThe primary energy impact of insulation is energy conservation as morebuildings are insulated more efficiently. The use of recovered materialsin the insulation products would not affect insulation or R-values.The use of glass cullet rather than virgin materials in fiberglass insulationhas been said to reduce energy consumption in fiberglass manufacture. DMTwaste bottoms have been said to be burned to recover energy value if theyare not recovered to produce products like insulation polyols. Data regardingquantities and potential energy impacts were not available. Therefore EPAsolicits comments on the energy impacts of using glass cullet rather thanvirgin materials in fiberglass and in using DMT waste bottoms in polyolsrather than as fuel.D. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation ismajor or nonmajor. The proposed guideline is not a major rule because itis unlikely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA does not believe that this guideline will result in higher prices northat adverse effects throughout the economy will result. In fact, the guidelinemay stimulate employment, competition, investment, productivity, innovationand United States enterprises may be able to compete more effectively withforeign based counterparts that are importing recovered materials.This proposed rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor review as required by Executive Order 12291.E. Regulatory Flexibility ActPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an agency publishes a general notice of rulemakingfor any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available forpublic comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impactof the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations,small governmental jurisdictions), unless the Administrator certifies thatthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.As described in the environmental, energy, and economic impact document,the economic impact on both small businesses and small governmental jurisdictionsis expected to be in some cases, negligible and in other instances, beneficial.An extremely limited number of business and governmental entities are affectedat all by the guideline.For the above reasons, EPA certifies that the proposed guideline is notexpected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. As a result, the guideline does not require a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 248</ITAG>Commercial item descriptions, Government procurement, Insulation, Militaryspecifications, Postconsumer materials, Recovered materials, Recycling,Resource recovery.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

(3) EPA recommends that minimum content standards (i) be based on insulationmaterial type, (ii) be based on the weight of component parts, (iii) referonly to the core insulation material and exclude from consideration anyfacing, binding or other materials surrounding or attached to the core,and (iv) include any insulation material that is used in composite products.(4) EPA recommends that the following minimum content standards be used:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25 </C>  <H1>Material type </H1><H1>Percent by weight</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on <D>75% postconsumer recovered paper material.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cellulose fiberboard <D>50% postconsumer recovered paper material.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perlite composite board <D>23% postconsumer recovered paper material.</D></ITAG>Polyisocyanurate:<ITAG tagnum="13">polyurethane:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Rigid foam board <D>9% recovered material.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Foam-in-place <D>5% recovered material.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenolic rigid foam <D>4% recovered material.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rock wool <D>50% recovered material.</D></ITAG></ITAG> (b)(1) In those cases where recovered material content is not yet, or maynot be consistently, available, EPA recommends that a case-by-case approachbe used. (2) The case-by-case approach as described in RCRA section 6002(i)(3)(A)of RCRA allows procuring agencies to make an award to a vendor offeringitems with less than the minimum content standard. All other things beingequal, the vendor offering the highest percentage of recovered materialcontent must be awarded the bid. EPA recommends that procuring agenciesuse the case-by-case approach to purchase building insulation productsin three instances: (i) When an item can technically contain recovered materials content butis not commercially available, or is not consistently available,(ii) When the item cannot be obtained with the standard minimum contentfor recovered material and no other method can be used to establish a newminimum content standard, or (iii) When an item becomes unavailable with recovered material content.Use of the case-by-case approach should continue in this instance untilit is proven that the recovered material will no longer be available forthe item or until a new minimum content standard can be set. (c) The recommendations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as wellas any other substantially equivalent affirmative procurement program thatan agency may adopt, are subject to the following limitations listed insection 6002(c)(1) of RCRA: (1) Maintenance of a satisfactory level of competition; (2) Availability within a reasonable period of time; (3) Ability to meet the specifications in the invitation for bids; (4) Availability at a reasonable price. (d) EPA recommends that if procuring agencies have difficulty obtaininga building insulation product for the reasons listed in paragraph (c) ofthis section, the procuring agencies should re-evaluate the minimum contentstandard. (e) Procuring agencies should examine their purchasing practices and eliminatethose which would inhibit the purchase of building insulation productscontaining recovered materials (e.g., bids for ``all or none'' when a broadrange of insulation products are required). (f) Procuring agencies should make determinations regarding competitionand availability in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR), 48 CFR Ch. 1 <T3>et seq.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;248.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Promotion program. </ITAG>EPA recommends that procuring agencies use the following methods, at aminimum, to promote their preference programs: (a) Place a statement in procurement invitations in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily </T3>or similar publications describing thepreference program. (b) Describe the preference program in solicitations or invitations forbids for or which include building insulation. (c) Discuss the preference program at bidders' conferences. (d) Inform industry trade associations about the preference program. (e) Publicize preferences for building insulation products made with recoveredmaterials in all product-related services and publications (e.g., Departmentof Housing and Urban development publications and product-related servicesdeveloped in compliance with section 521 of the National Housing Act, suchas: National Building Codes, Bulletins, Materials Releases, EngineeringBulletins, and Use of Materials Information). (f) Issue press releases describing the affirmative procurement programto recycling industry publications. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.23</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Estimates, certification, and verification.</ITAG>Each procuring agency must develop estimation, certification and verificationprocedures:(a) When a vendor supplies a building insulation product, the contractingofficer must require the vendor to estimate the total percentage of recoveredmaterial content in that insulation product. EPA recommends that procuringagencies maintain records of these estimates for three years by type ofproduct, quantity purchased, and price paid.(b)(1) When a procurement solicitation or invitation for bid requires aminimum recovered materials content, procuring agencies must require offerorsor bidders to certify that the percentage of recovered material to be usedin the performance of the contract will be at least the amount requiredby the solicitation or invitation for bid.(2) When using the case-by-case approach, a procuring agency must requireofferors or bidders to certify that the percentage of recovered materialsto be used in the performance of the contract will be at least the minimumpercentage described in the offer in response to the invitation for bids.(c)(1) EPA recommends that procuring agencies develop verification proceduresfor certifications and estimates of recovered materials content in buildinginsulation products that require access only to manufacturers' recordsof recovered materials and comparable virgin materials used in each batch.Verification need not include review of records of other ingredients usedin small percentages, which could include confidential business information.(2) EPA recommends that the average of recovered materials used in a specificinsulation product over a one-month period be used, if necessary, for verificationof estimates of recovered materials content actually utilized in insulationproducts supplied to a procuring agency.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.24</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Annual review and monitoring.</ITAG>(a) Each procuring agency must conduct an annual review and monitoringof the effectiveness of its affirmative procurement program.(b) EPA recommends that the annual review include the following items:(1) An estimate of the quantity of building insulation with recovered materialcontent purchased and the total quantity of building insulation productspurchased.(2) An assessment of the effectiveness of the promotion program.(3) An assessment of any remaining barriers to purchase of insulation withrecovered content to determine whether they are internal (e.g., resistanceto use) or external (e.g., unavailability).(4) A review of the range of estimates and certifications of recoveredmaterials content in building insulation products provided by vendors duringthe year to determine whether minimum content standards should be raisedor lowered, or whether a change from the case-by-case approach to the minimumcontent standard approach is necessary.(5) A program to gather statistics. Procuring agencies should monitor theirprocurements to provide data on the following:(i) The percentages of recovered materials content in the products procuredor offered;(ii) Comparative price information on competitive procurements;(iii) The quantity of each item procured over a fiscal year; (iv) The availability of the insulation products to procuring agencies;(v) Type of performance tests conducted, together with the type of buildinginsulation product containing recovered materials content that failed thetests, the percentages of total virgin products and products containingrecovered materials content supplied that failed each test, and the natureof the failure;(vi) Agency experience with the performance of the procured products.(c) Procuring agencies should prepare a report on their annual review andmonitoring of the effectiveness of their procurement programs and makethese reports available to the public. The reports should contain the followinginformation:(1) If the case-by-case approach or a substantially equivalent alternativeis being used, a discussion of how the procuring agency's approach procuresbuilding insulation products containing recovered materials to the maximumextent practicable. The basis for this discussion should be a review ofthe data compiled on recovered materials content, price, availability,and performance, as well as a comparison of estimates and certificationsprovided by the vendors.(2) If the minimum content standards approach is being used, a discussionof whether the minimum content standards in use should be raised, lowered,or remain constant for each item. The basis for this discussion shouldbe a review of the data compiled on recovered materials content, price,availability, and performance, as well as a comparison of estimates andcertifications provided by the vendors.(3) Documentation of specification revisions made during the year.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.25</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Implementation.</ITAG>Procuring agencies must begin procurement of building insulation products,in compliance with this guideline, one year from [the date of publicationof the final guideline].<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-17332 Filed 8-1-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
