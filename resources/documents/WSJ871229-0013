Currently New Zealand hasn't any statutory rules against insider trading, relying instead on voluntary stock exchange guidelines.    Rather than create criminal sanctions, the legislation is expected to allow companies and individuals to seek compensation in the civil courts for losses resulting from insider trading.    Justice Minister Geoffrey Palmer said legislation would be largely &quot;self-policing,&quot; with incentives for civil actions arising from the prospect of recovering losses.    The recommendations in the commission report on insider trading would form the basis for legislation.    The report says that individuals who buy or sell a security from an insider with confidential information and who then incur a loss as a result, should have the right to seek compensation from the insider.    Companies also would have the right to seek compensation for gains made or losses avoided by an insider. There would be additional civil penalties.    The report recommended setting up a register of beneficial interests in a company's securities held by directors, officers and employees, and giving courts the power to disqualify an insider trader from holding office in a company. Among other things, the report also recommended giving courts the ability to revoke a stockbroker's license for insider trading, and forcing the disclosure of substantial shareholdings. </TEXT></DOC>
