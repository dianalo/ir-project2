Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said theNavy had managed to recover some parts of the missile from theocean floor off Cape Canaveral, Fla., and to analyze more of theradio telemetry data from the launch.   ``They have determined from the telemetry at this point that thedifficulty was not with the guidance system or any of theelectrical systems,'' Howard said.   ``The most likely suspect is a mechanical failure in the nozzlemechanism.''   The Navy's investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident2 missile fired from the submarine Tennessee self-destructed justfour seconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface asplanned and the first stage ignited properly, but then the missilebegan spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded.   It was the first submarine launch of the Navy's newest and mostpowerful weapon.   According to Howard, the first-stage rocket nozzles of themissile are supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put theweapon on a 19-degree angle of flight. Then, another internalcommand is sent to the nozzles to straighten back up, thusmaintaining the 19-degree flight angle.   In this case, the spokesman says, the nozzles never straightenedback up after the second command and it appears the cause wasmechanical.   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weaponthat is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads toindividual targets up to 6,000 miles away.   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than itsundersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and canmatch the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though itis launched from a submerged, moving submarine.   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry24 of the deadly missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
