The algal assay is a chronic test, while all other tests describedin the manual are acute tests. The methods are one of several tools,including chemical analysis and field study, used to determine toxicityof hazardous-waste sites. The toxicity tests provided in the manual canbe used to detect toxic materials, rank sites based on relative short-termtoxicity, and provide a cost-effective approach to monitoring the effectivenessof site cleanup. The toxicity tests in the manual are not required byregulation. However, because toxicity tests measure the integrated effectsof complex chemical waste mixtures, they provide a reasonable basis forassessing the toxicity of waste products independent of existing concentrationcriteria.</TEXT></DOC>
