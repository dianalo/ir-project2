The Reagan administration will take the proposal to 14 allied capitals in Western Europe starting next week, in a fresh bid to improve the efficiency of an allied ban on the transfer of such technology to the Soviet bloc.    &quot;If this community of nations can form an effective barrier against diversion to the outside, there's no reason why we can't have more open trading within,&quot; said Allan Wendt, the State Department's senior representative for strategic technology policy.    Mr. Wendt is heading an interagency team, including representatives of the Defense and Commerce Departments, that will call on European members of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the Paris-based organization that oversees this allied effort. Cocom expects to hold a &quot;senior political meeting&quot; later this year that will make formal an exchange of commitments, he said.    Cocom is made up of the U.S., Japan, and 14 North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.    Doing away with licenses for the so-called &quot;West-West&quot; trade would lift an enormous burden from U.S. exporters. A National Academy of Sciences study has estimated that such curbs are costing the U.S. more than $11 billion in lost export opportunities each year. The allies also would benefit by getting quicker access to U.S. technology.    The administration's proposal echoes a recently approved House bill to remove controls from shipments bound for Cocom countries except for &quot;extraordinarily sophisticated goods or technology.&quot; However, the administration makes a clearer linkage between changes that benefit the allies and those countries' ability to secure sensitive goods.    Among other things, the U.S. wants its allies to legislate heavier fines and prison terms for export-control violations, enlarge inspection staffs, and improve methods for verifying the identities of buyers. U.S. officials say that some Cocom members, including Italy, Portugal, Greece and Turkey, are falling short in these fields.    &quot;In some countries shipping a banned item to the Soviet Union would get you only a civil penalty,&quot; a State Department aide said. In the U.S. and a few European countries, such violations are punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment for as long as five years.    The administration's proposal also seeks bigger financial contributions to pay for Cocom's control efforts, with those amounts measured against a country's share of the global technology trade. Trade analysts took this to mean that Japan, West Germany, France and Britain are expected to pump in more resources into the Cocom embargo than smaller allied exporters.    The U.S. offers to do away with unilateral controls such as requiring reexport licenses for U.S. parts incorporated into Western European or Japanese products. Britain has strongly protested such controls, asserting that they infringe on its own legal jurisdiction.    Mr. Wendt noted that Japan's foreign minister, Tadashi Kurinari, and trade minister, Hajime Tamura, are &quot;fully committed&quot; to strengthening Japan's control mechanisms.    He also said that the U.S. could extend the benefits of unlicensed trade to cover countries outside Cocom, such as Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, South Korea and Singapore, if they adopt &quot;Cocom-like&quot; controls. </TEXT></DOC>
