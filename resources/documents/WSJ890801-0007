Reflecting concerns by many lawmakers about Northrop's quality-control efforts and the performance of the radar-eluding B-2s, the Senate approved warranty standards believed to be more stringent than those applied to any other major weapons system in recent years.    By a voice vote, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) that could require Northrop, among other things, to give up all of its profit on the next five Stealth bombers if repairs are needed for certain contractor-caused defects. The amendment doesn't affect the first six B-2s covered by a research and development contract, but it would kick in when low-volume production begins on the next batch of airplanes.    According to Sen. Levin, the Air Force estimates that Northrop could make a profit of about $50 million on each of the aircraft. But under its current contract with the Pentagon, he said, the firm has a maximum liability of $4 million a plane to fix its own mistakes. &quot;That's simply unacceptable,&quot; Sen. Levin asserted. &quot;I'm afraid that's not good government.&quot;    The amendment gives the defense secretary an escape clause to adhere to a less-stringent standard, but only if he justifies his reasons to Congress.    In Los Angeles, Northrop officials declined comment on the amendment, saying they hadn't had time to study it. But analysts said it appeared, on first glance at least, that the legislation was more significant politically than financially. &quot;It's a great way of putting their feet to the fire,&quot; said Wolfgang Demisch, of UBS Securities in New York. But he added that he'd &quot;be very surprised&quot; if the aerospace concern's bottom line was much affected. Indeed, Mr. Demisch seemed more encouraged than discouraged by the news from Capitol Hill. He said profits of $50 million-a-plane, depending on how they are measured, suggested slightly better margins than he believed possible so early in a program.    Some, though, said even if Northrop's balance sheet escapes real damage, its stock price could be hurt by the tone of Sen. Levin's amendment. Congress has &quot;put another knife in and twisted it,&quot; said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.    Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the Republican floor manager for the $305 billion military authorization bill, served notice that he and other lawmakers may try to water down the B-2 warranty provision during talks with House leaders.    In other matters, the Senate today is expected to approve a series of non-binding amendments intended to reduce the cost of keeping U.S. troops overseas. Lawmakers are likely to demand that President Bush begin negotiations aimed at prodding Japan and South Korea to shoulder billions of dollars of additional costs to keep American soldiers and sailors in Asia.    The Senate, as it struggles to dispose of more than 70 remaining amendments to the defense bill this week, also is expected to include language intended to head off unilateral troop reductions by U.S. allies in Europe. Lawmakers, in effect, want to mandate U.S. troop cuts in proportion to cutbacks in uniformed strength by European allies, if they occur. Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the message to European leaders will be clear: &quot;If you cut unilaterally, we're not going to be left holding the bag,&quot; he said.    ---   Rick Wartzman in Los Angeles contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
