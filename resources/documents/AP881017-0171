(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The salaries and benefits given PTLfounders Jim and Tammy Bakker were properly approved and legal, theBakkers' lawyer told a judge Monday in the trial of PTL's $52million lawsuit against the couple and a former aide.   In his opening statement, Ryan Hovis said the case against theBakkers boiled down to allegations they mismanaged the ministry,which went into bankruptcy three months after Bakker resigned in asex-and-hush money scandal.   Hovis said he would show that the Bakkers' salaries wereauthorized by the ministry's board, the benefits they enjoyed wereproperly donated by the ministry and the cash advances theyreceived were reimbursed.   But because the ministry's records are now dispersed among otherlegal actions, including bankruptcy court, Hovis said he may beunable to provide precise documentation.   ``A lot of the records are simply not available,'' he told U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.   Instead, Hovis said, he would show a ``pattern ofreimbursement'' and prior approval.   Hovis' comments marked the start of the second half of testimonyin the lawsuit against the Bakkers and former aide David Taggart.   Last month, PTL attorneys Tom White and Brad Leggett enteredinto evidence financial records from Bakker's time as leader of PTLand brought in PTL officials and an Internal Revenue Service agentto testify on behalf of its claims of mismanagement.   Among the items admitted as evidence were receipts forextravagant purchases by the Bakkers, including installing a waterslide at their lakefront home.   PTL also presented IRS documents that the Bakkers and Taggartreceived compensation and bonuses far in excess of accepted IRSguidelines.   On Monday, Herbert Moore, who said he has done financialconsulting work for hundreds of churches including PTL, testifiedthat standard financial procedures for businesses were not the normfor churches, which found needs first and then sought the revenuesto pay for them.   ``Is it fair to say that financial matters of the church aredealt with on faith?'' Hovis asked.   ``Yes,'' Moore replied.   PTL sought protection in June 1987 under Chapter 11 of thebankruptcy code, which shields an operation from creditors while itreorganizes.   On Monday, Reynolds, who is overseeing the bankruptcy case, saidhe wants to see how the proposed sale of the ministry's HeritageUSA complex shapes up before considering whether to liquidate PTL'sassets.   Reynolds postponed until Nov. 16 consideration of severalmotions by creditors to move the ministry from Chapter 11 toChapter 7. If granted, it would mean the Heritage USA Christianentertainment park and other ministry assets such as satellitetelevision facilities, a hotel and real estate would be sold by animmediate auction rather than by an arranged sale.   Canadian businessman Stephen Mernick has signed a contract withPTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to buy Heritage USA for$115 million, and Nov. 16 is the date Benton is to present theproposed sale to the court.   ``As you'll observe, I'm stacking everything up to the 16th, tosee what washes out by then,'' Reynolds said.   Meanwhile, Benton said the ministry's payroll has continued toshrink, with about 150 people laid off since Labor Day, includingabout 100 seasonal and temporary employees.   The trustee said the ministry's labor force was down to about400 people evenly divided between the for-profit debtor corporationholding the ministry's assets, and the non-profit ministry.   The ministry had about 1,480 full-time employees at the time itfiled for bankruptcy protection.</TEXT></DOC>
