Botha will notgo to Zambia this week to confer with leaders of other Africannations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Roland Darroll said Monday.   His statement came in response to reports that Botha planned togo to Lusaka, Zambia, to meet with President Kenneth Kaunda andseveral other black African leaders.   Botha has visited Mozambique, Malawi and Zaire over the pastthree weeks for meetings that were seen as a breakthrough forwhite-dominated South Africa.   Botha told a public meeting Monday night in the town of Georgein Cape province signs emerged of ``greater understanding andcooperation but leaders of southern Africa still have to take thegreat step in getting together.''   ``Over many years the perception has developed that South Africais a belligerent country in an antagonist region,'' he said.``Events in recent months have questioned the validity of thisperception.''   Botha noted labor-market, scientific and technological linksbetween his country and its neighbors and said, ``A strong basisfor cooperation already exists between South Africa and the otherstates in the region.''   Malawi is the only African country that has formal diplomaticties with South Africa but some other countries have trade missions.   South Africa has been politically isolated because of its policyof apartheid.   By South African laws and customs, apartheid establishes aracially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have novote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economyand maintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
