The rain flooded citrus groves in south Lebanon, where Amal, thelargest Shiite Moslem militia faction, and United Nationspeacekeepers have searched since Lt. Col. William R. Higgins wasabducted Feb.17 near Tyre, 50 miles south of Beirut.   An Amal spokesman confirmed a report the militia captured gunmeninvolved in the kidnapping of Higgins, a onetime aide to formerU.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and leader of a U.N.observers' group in Lebanon.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, Weinberger's successor,said Wednesday in Washington that too much was being made ofHiggins' role with the defense secretary's office.   Carlucci, responding to a question, said: ``Let me point outthat Lt. Col. Higgins was a lower-ranking officer in the office ofthe secretary of defense, which has about 38 people in it. Myprincipal military aide is a major general.''   ``Lt. Col. Higgins' functions were mainly administrative. Ithink overly much is being made of this in the press and if I maysay, I'd prefer to limit by comments to that because I think anyfurther comment tends to encourage undesirable and unwise pressspeculation.''   The Amal spokesman said the detainees had not been able toprovide information on the whereabouts of Higgins or theabduction's mastermind, who escaped.   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth hasclaimed it abducted Higgins and alleged he was a CIA spy. U.S. andU.N. officials denied the accusation.   On Monday, the group released a videotaped message in which thecaptive recited conditions for his release _ Israeli withdrawalfrom south Lebanon, release of Palestinian and Lebanese detaineesheld by Israel and suspension of U.S. diplomatic activity in theMiddle East.   Security sources in Tyre said the Amal search for Higgins, 43,of Danville, Ky., was continuing.   ``The weather has generally been against the search campaign,''said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Heavy rainsand storms hamper the search by Amal.''   The Amal spokesman said the group arrested in the Tyre regionthree gunmen ``who seized Col. Higgins and forced him into thefirst getaway car and three men who had monitored Higgins'movements before the abduction.''   Amal also captured ``the man who was supposed to transportHiggins to Beirut,'' he said.   The seven detainees are among 42 members of the fundamentalistHezbollah, or Party of God, arrested by Amal in the past week.   Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has supported Higgins'abduction, calling him a ``filthy American.'' It claimed Amal hasabducted 150 of its members.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for smallerfactions involved in the kidnapping of 24 other foreigners missingin Lebanon. The kidnapped include eight other Americans.   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry Anderson, 40, ofLorain, Ohio. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985.   Hezbollah and Amal have been vying for control of south Lebanon.   The Amal spokesman said the group was ``coordinating efforts''with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. ``We keep UNIFILinformed on all developments.''   The Amal spokesman said his militia group, which is headed byJustice Minister Nabih Berri and backed by Syria, ``supports UNIFILand will not permit such acts to reflect negatively on thepeacekeeping force.''   Higgins headed a 76-man U.N. team of observers that monitoredviolations of a 1949 Lebanese-Israeli armistice agreement along theborder. The observers were attached to the U.N. forces when thenine-nation, 5,800-man force deployed in south Lebanon in 1978after an Israeli intervention.   The U.N. commander, Lt. Gen. Gustav Hagglund of Finland, toldreporters Tuesday that further kidnappings of U.N. personnel would``endanger the future'' of the peacekeeping forces. He said Swedishsoldiers have been ordered ``not to leave their posts or movearound south Lebanon alone.''   Hagglund met in Naqoura on Wednesday with U.N.Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, a U.N. source said.Goulding had flown to UNIFIL headquarters by helicopter fromIsrael, hoping to fly on to Beirut.   He later returned to Israel, said the source, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   UNIFIL's chief spokesman, Timur Goksel, said only that ``Mr.Goulding's helicopter flight to Beirut has been postponed due tobad weather conditions.''</TEXT></DOC>
