Jaramillo said the foundation is trying to servethose patients with other programs.;    Foundation officials cited financialproblems last September when they announced the closing of two of thefoundation's five clinics and the discontinuation of the low-cost program,known as Health Plan Plus.;    Those actions prompted the lawsuit, in whichcritics sought to oust the entire board of directors and have acourt-appointed receiver take over clinic operations.
