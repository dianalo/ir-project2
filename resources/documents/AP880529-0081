(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An investor group considering a takeoverof Payless Cashways Inc. has stepped up pressure on the buildingmaterials retailer by asking for a special shareholders meeting torescind a takeover defense provision.   The group also criticized a compensation plan for Payless' 24top officers if they lost their jobs because of a change in thecompany's ownership. The plan, which had not previously beendisclosed, was ratified earlier this month by Payless' board ofdirectors, Payless spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said Friday.   The investor group is led by New York-based takeover specialistAsher B. Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., a privatelyowned competitor of Payless that also is based in Kansas City.   Payless has about 200 stores in 25 states.   The group owns 9.9 percent of Payless' stock, or 3.34 millionshares, and has said that it might attempt a takeover of thecompany.   The group disclosed its intentions May 19 when it said that itcontrolled 7.6 percent of Payless' stock. It has spent about $70million since then to increase its holding in the company.   The investor group requested the special shareholders meeting ina letter sent to Payless late Friday. The letter asked that themeeting be held within 90 days.   David Stanley, chairman and chief executive of Payless, has saidthat a takeover by the Edelman-Sutherland group would not be in thebest interest of the company.   Payless adopted its takeover defense May 12, the same day itratified the executive compensation plan. The provision essentiallyincreases the cost of a takeover.   Financial analysts have said the takeover could cost as much as$1 billion.   The investor group has asked that three amendments to Payless'bylaws be submitted to a vote by shareholders.   In addition to the amendment rescinding the takeover defenseprovision, another amendment would allow shareholders to vote onany takeover offer made to the company that had the approval fromholders of at least 10 percent of Payless' stock. The thirdamendment would require any further takeover defenses to beapproved by holders of at least 50 percent of the shares.</TEXT></DOC>
