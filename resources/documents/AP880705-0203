While Moslem religious leaders have not come out in praise ofin-vitro (test-tube) fertilization, they vaguely have approved itsuse in strictly controlled situations.   So, as the government spends almost $60 million a year to curbpopulation growth, thousands of dollars in private money are spentby couples who want children.   ``Overpopulation does not contradict this idea,'' said Hassanel-Deeb of the Ministry of Health. ``Every wife wants to become amother, and 50 or 100 more (people) a year won't affect thepopulation.''   Egypt has 54 million people and gets a million new ones everyeight months. It must feed them off just 4 percent of the landarea, the Nile valley. The country imports 60 percent of its grain.   Religious considerations play a large role in acceptance of thein-vitro technique, or fertilizing an egg outside the womb in atest tube for re-implantation.   Islam has no written laws concerning in-vitro fertilization, butit is taken for granted that only married couples can use it. Andto date, Egypt has no sperm or embryo banks, nor can women givebirth as surrogates for others, because many clerics and Moslemdoctors say these practices risk adultery.   To disobey these religious interpretations would have the effectof removing a doctor's right to practice medicine.   Under Islamic law, an adopted child cannot be given the fosterparents' name, unless the natural parents are unknown. The adoptedchild also lacks the full rights of natural offspring, includinginheritance. Unless the foster parent specifically bequeathsproperty to the adopted child in a will, the child gets nothing.Even with the will, however, the child can receive no more thanone-third of the bequeathed property.   Couples seeking to avoid those restrictions are resorting toin-vitro fertilization.   The ad hoc moral standards regulating in-vitro fertilization areshared widely by Egypt's Moslems and its 10 percent Christianminority. But for Moslems, Islamic theologians, known as the ulema,set down the condition that the in-vitro procedure must beperformed by a Moslem doctor.   ``Islam requires preservation of family lineage forinheritance,'' said Sheik Abdallah el-Mashad of al-Azhar Mosque,the Moslem world's highest center of theological learning.``Therefore, the doctor carrying out the in-vitro fertilizationmust be a trustworthy Moslem believer with a good reputation.''   As head of al-Azhar's Fatwa Council, which interprets Islam'sholy book, the Koran, el-Mashad is empowered to announce opinionson controversial matters. The world's Moslems are expected tofollow.   In Cairo's plush suburb of Heliopolis, Mohammed Fayez, co-ownerof an in-vitro fertilization center, said his team followsel-Azhar's directions even though they are not legally binding.   He said the al-Azhar shieks, therefore, give his clinic notrouble, but it has run into opponents of test-tube baby technologywho ``are afraid the doctors might do something wrong and mix thespecimen. I tell them we can't fully guarantee anything in life.''   The center is one of three major in-vitro clinics in the capitalarea. Fayez said the clinic has achieved two pregnancies amongabout 20 patients since it began late last summer.   He said his clinic charges the equivalent of about $1,450 forthe first two attempts at fertilization, and $975 for the nextthree.   In this Middle Eastern culture typically centered on familylife, childlessness spells problems for a couple. Offspring areconsidered necessary to help in the fields, improve the economicstandard of poor families or to keep the wealth of the rich withinthe family.   ``If there is a one percent chance for couples to have their ownthey will try. Adoption is not favored,'' said Fayez.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs July 11</NOTE></DOC>
