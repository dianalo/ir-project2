The supervisors voted 10-0 with one member absent Monday toapprove an ordinance allowing unmarried couples, homosexual orheterosexual, to register with the city as domestic partners. Theyalso urged the mayor to consider extending health benefits tolive-in lovers of city employees.   The legislation, a first for a major U.S. city, faces a secondprocedural vote next week before going to Mayor Art Agnos, who hassaid he will sign it.   Homosexual rights groups gave cautious praise to the legislation.   ``It's an important first step,'' said Roberta Achtenberg,executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.``There is no one piece of legislation that could've gone farenough.''   The precise benefits of the legislation remain unclear becauseno one knows if health care benefits will ultimately becomeavailable to domestic partners of city employees, she said. Still,she predicted that many homosexual and unmarried heterosexualcouples will register.   The Roman Catholic Church helped defeat a similar proposal in1982. But after Monday's vote, Deacon Norman Phillips of the SanFrancisco Archdiocese expressed resignation.   ``We could always hope that it wasn't going to happen, but Ithink sensibly, it looked like it was going to,'' Phillips said.``I think our hope would be that they might reconsider.''   The church is opposed to the ``pseudo-marriage'' provision ofthe legislation, although it supports the extension of civil rightsbenefits and health coverage, Phillips said.   But some advocates complained that while the burdens of domesticpartnership are substantial under the ordinance _ includingbecoming responsible for each other's basic living expenses _ thebenefits remain somewhat unclear.   Board of Supervisors President Harry Britt, author of themeasure and a leader of the city's politically powerful gaycommunity, acknowledged the doubts but was confident nevertheless.   ``There are still obstacles ahead of us, in terms of working outthe health insurance part of this,'' said Britt. ``We're sure wecan do it, and that we can do it without any negative effects onanybody. It's not going to cost the taxpayers any money.''   Some city employees worry that health care premiums could riseif the cost of insuring domestic partners _ including AIDSpatients, in the city with the highest per capita number of suchpatients in the nation _ drains city funds. Health and insuranceofficials, however, claim the newly eligible people will have anegligible effect on the city because employees' dependents mustpay monthly premiums of about $150.   Despite the criticisms, Britt spoke passionately of thefundamental right of people to pursue love on their own terms.   ``If my heart tells me and your heart tells you that we shouldshare our lives together and take care of one another ... thegovernment has no business telling us that we're going to bediscriminated against,'' he said.   ``I hope that other cities around the country ... will belooking at ways to change their laws to reflect the reality of theway people live,'' Britt said.   A few other cities, including Berkeley, across the San FranciscoBay, have adopted policies extending health benefits to live-inlovers, and 219 couples in West Hollywood have registered since1985 for a domestic partnership certificate.   San Francisco would be the first major metropolitan city toallow non-married couples to register their relationships astraditional couples file marriage licenses.   The law defines domestic partners as any ``two people who havechosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and committedrelationship.'' The ``Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' formwould be filed with the county clerk for a $35 fee.   Under the partnership law, 25,000 city workers would be entitledto the same bereavement leave that is accorded married couples, andhospital visitation rights would extend to live-in lovers.</TEXT></DOC>
