The Senate voted 56-43 Friday night to approve the bill, butonly after deciding at the last minute that it couldn't take thepoltical risk of the bigger House-passed pay raise. Instead,senators would keep taking honoraria from interest groups, amuch-criticized practice eliminated by the House.   ``We have done exactly the wrong thing tonight. We havefailed,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo.   But the Senate didn't cut back the raise that applies to theHouse, federal judges and top government executives, and the Houseearly today gave the measure final approval and shipped the packageto the president. The House gave its approval in a voice vote atnearly 1:30 a.m. with whistling and cheers in the chamber.   Bush has said he would sign the bill, which includes a series ofreforms of congressional and government-wide ethics rules.   For the House and the other top officials, salaries would risefrom the current $89,500 to $96,600 by Jan. 1 and to at least$120,800 and probably closer to $125,000 a year later, depending ongovernment-wide cost of living adjustments at that time.   In 1991, when a 25 percent pay boost making up the bulk of theincrease takes effect, the practice of House members acceptingspeaking fees for appearances before interest groups will end andCongress' other outside earnings will be limited.   The Senate opted for taking a 9.9 percent raise on Jan. 1 to$98,400, and gradually reducing the amount of honoraria its memberscan keep. Currently, they can keep speaking fees up to 40 percentof their salaries.   The Senate decision meant different salary scales for the Senateand House, with the Senate earning more at first and the Housepassing it later.   That would be unusual but not unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982,to July 1, 1983, the Senate was paid $60,662 and the House $69,800.   Besides the pay-honoraria issue, the legislation contains abroad range of changes in ethics rules.   No lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowedfor one year. Cabinet-level officials at the White House also wouldface a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government.   In addition to banning honoraria, the legislation would put newrestrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers and othergovernment officials can accept from people outside their immediatefamily.   The legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of Housemembers elected before 1980 to, upon retirement, transfer thebalance of their campaign treasuries for personal use.</TEXT></DOC>
