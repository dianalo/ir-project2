Volume was light, which accentuated the declines. Traders said there wasn't any market-moving news to depress stocks.    Frankfurt and London shares fell slightly, also on light volume and an absence of market-moving news.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average plunged 393.31 points to 24509.41. Losers outnumbered gainers, 650 to 246.    Turnover came to about 500 million shares, down from 700 million shares during Saturday's half-day session and 900 million shares Friday.    One broker said investors seemed tired of reflex reactions to currency and bond price fluctuations and needed fresh factors on which to trade.    The meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries provided some suspense over the weekend, but subsequent oil production announcements have robbed the event of much of its market-moving melodrama. OPEC reached a production compromise that is expected to push up oil prices.    In the banking group, Sumitomo Bank fell 110 yen to 4,120 yen ($28.16), Mitsubishi Trust fell 100 yen to 4,250 yen and Industrial Bank of Japan eased 40 yen to 4,510 yen.    Brokerage shares tumbled, with Nomura Securities down 160 yen to 4,490 yen, Yamaichi Securities down 90 yen to 2,310 yen and Nikko Securities down 40 yen to 2,330 yen.    Daiei, a large operator of supermakets, fell 120 yen to 1,780 yen, and Marui Department Store fell 50 yen to 3,490 yen.    Among construction shares, Kajima fell 20 yen to 1,730 yen and Taisei declined 10 yen to 1,060 yen.    Kirin Brewery eased 50 yen to 2,640 yen and Sapporo Breweries slipped 40 yen to 1,980 yen.    Frankfurt trading was also sluggish, and brokers cited some profit-taking after last week's sharp gains. In addition, brokers said foreign investors were selling some blue-chips.    The stability of the dollar above 1.82 marks, which boosted equities last week, was already discounted by investors, brokers said.    Chemical, auto and financial shares were mostly lower.    But Bayerische Motoren Werke was unchanged at 682 marks ($373.43) as unconfirmed rumors that Ford Motor might acquire a stake in the group offset the downward pressures on the market.    Daimler-Benz fell 10 marks to 1117 marks and Volkswagen slid 4.5 marks to 425.5 marks.    London trading was quiet, with the 100-share index down 2.0 points to 2289.3 and the Financial Times 30-share index off 6.1 at 1784.6.    Traders said the decline was the result of a lack of interest, caused by muggy weather, the first day of a new three-week trading account, the approach of the end of the second quarter and weekend press comments that suggested the market had traveled far enough and was due to sidetrack until a resurgence in September.    Oil shares, however, were higher, with the anticipation of rising oil prices after the OPEC agreement.    British Petroleum closed up 10 pence at 389 pence ($6.27) before the announcement that the company completed its merger with Standard Oil of the U.S.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                   % This                            June 26    June 25     Year    U.S. ................... 286.6      288.3     + 25.7    Britain ................ 688.9      684.0     + 38.4    Canada ................. 414.3      411.4     + 24.4    Japan ................. 1275.6     1277.2     + 35.0    France ................. 409.0      404.0     +  0.2    Germany ................ 234.1      233.3     -  9.9    Hong Kong ............. 2246.5     2248.5     + 26.3    Switzerland ............ 190.2      189.4     -  5.3    Australia .............. 327.7      327.0     + 24.1    World index ............ 470.1      470.3     + 31.7</TEXT></DOC>
