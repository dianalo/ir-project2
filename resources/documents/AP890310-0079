MANIAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Delegates from 30 nations havedrafted a plan asking Vietnam to curtail the exodus of boat peoplefrom its shores, officials at the international conference said.   However, the group, which ended a three-day meeting Thursday,ruled out forcibly repatriating asylum-seekers who cannot show theyare fleeing political persecution, officials said.   The delegates laid out the measures in a draft plan forconsideration at the International Conference on IndochineseRefugees in Geneva in June.   Chairman Majid Mohamed told a news conference the plan would help``provide durable solutions to the Indochinese refugee problem.''   The draft plan suggests Vietnam launch a campaign stressing therisks and hardships of fleeing by boat and work to end illegaldepartures by boat people. It also calls on Vietnam to make legaldepartures easier.   Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and othercountries in the region have agreed to provide only temporary asylumfor refugees. Western nations were urged to take in refugees left incamps in Southeast Asia.   Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the conferencevoted not to recommend a deadline by which those seeking asylumwould be screened to decide whether they qualified for resettlementin the West.   Officials said Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,Singapore, Australia, and some other Southeast Asian countries hadasked the conference to recommend forcible repatriation of boatpeople and others fleeing their countries for reasons other thanpolitical persecution.   Vietnam, the United States, Sweden, the U.N. high commissionerfor refugees were among nations opposed tyo forced repatriation onhumanitarian grounds, said the officials.   ``The rules are very clear ... whenever refugees are repatriated,it has to be on a voluntary basis,'' said Jean Pierre Hocke, theU.N. high commissioner for refugees.   The officials said the Vietnamese delegation, led by DeputyForeign Minister Vu Khoan, had agreed at the conference to take backanyone who wanted to return voluntarily.   Western delegations present said they might take in additionalrefugees and step up financial aid to help implement the plan.   So far, 150,000 people have emigrated legally from Vietnam underits Orderly Departure Program.   There are about 300,000 Indochinese refugees in Southeast Asia.About 1.5 million have been resettled since the outflow began 10years ago, more than 800,000 of them in the United States, officialssaid.   Majid said the plan would be sent to U.N. Secretary GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar in New York for the Geneva conference June13-14.</TEXT></DOC>
