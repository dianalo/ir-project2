SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   College-educated women who postponed havingchildren until their 30s are getting earlier pre-natal care andhaving fewer underweight babies than other mothers, according to agovernment report.   Four times more women aged 30 to 34 had first babies in 1986 thandid women in the same age group in 1970, the National Center forHealth Statistics reported Wednesday.   Between 1970 and 1986, the number of first births to women 30 to34 increased from 42,404 to 181,504, the center reported. For women35 to 39, the total first births rose from 11,704 to 44,427.   The increase in older first-time mothers reflects women who havepostponed families while completing educations and launchingcareers, sociologists have reported.   Among women 30 to 34, the proportion of first-time mothers whohave college degrees increased from 40 percent in 1975 to 48 percentin 1986, according to the report compiled by Stephanie J. Ventura.   Although some increase can be attributed to the overall rise ineducation among women, the rate also reflects that some women arepostponing having children, the report said.   ``It is apparent that well-educated women ... have postponedchildbearing, and that they are making up for at least some of thedelay at a growing pace,'' Ventura said.   Better-educated mothers are seeking earlier medical attention forthemselves and their babies, resulting in fewer underweight births,according to the study, ``Trends and Variations in First Births toOlder Women, 1970-86.''   Birth weight is widely used as a measure of infant health, withbabies weighing less than 5 pounds 8 ounces considered at risk.   For women 30 to 34, the report found, 7.5 percent of all firstbirths suffered from low birth weight. But among women with collegeeducations the share was 5.8 percent.   ``Greater educational attainment ... is associated with moretimely receipt of pre-natal care and a better outcome in terms ofbirth weight,'' Ventura said.   As of 1986, for example, about 91 percent of first-time mothers30 to 34 began pre-natal care during the first trimester of theirpregnancy, the report showed.   By comparison, 77.4 percent of all first-time mothers startedcare that early, and among women 15-19 pre-natal care was begun inthe first three months by only 55.8 percent of first-time mothers.   The report did not go into other health factors concerning theage at which women first gave birth.   The study comes just two weeks after a Census Bureau reportshowed that one-third of all the children born in 1988 had mothers30 and over.   While women in their 30s were having more children, the birthrate for younger women has been declining while those women pursueeducations and careers.   When asked in surveys about expectations of future births, largenumbers of these women continued to report plans for families.   ``The question that remains is to what extent those women whointend to have children will actually have the children they expectto bear,'' Ventura wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
