(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Ben MyersandM;The SCSI device driver bundled with 386-based IBM PS/2s is a double-edgedsword.andP;  With the driver installed, users pay a severe performance penalty.andO;Without it, they risk system lockup if the computers are running certainmultitasking DOS applications or 386 memory managers.andM;The processing rate of a PS/2 Model 70 or 80, equipped with IBM's newbus-mastering Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) controller, can drop bya factor of three when the device driver is installed, according to PC Weektests.andP;  Without the driver, however, 386-specific programs, such as BorlandInternational Inc.'s Turbo Debugger in 386 mode, won't work at all.andM;With DISK386.SYS removed, PC Week's LANperf benchmark test achieved athroughput peak of 950K bytes per second on a PS/2 Model 80-A21 equipped witha SCSI drive.andP;  Throughput dropped to 300K bytes per second with the driverinstalled.andP;  As a result, the SCSI drive is slower than a standard Model 80'sESDI hard drive.andP;  Microsoft Windows 386, running concurrently with severaldisk-intensive applications, also slowed significantly on PC Week's Model 80.andM;According to Andy McNeill, an IBM engineer, the speed degradation resultsfrom the driver's breaking large data requests into 4K-byte chunks.andM;The Model 80's Quick Reference manual does not clearly advise when the drivershould and should not be used.andP;  Before removing the driver, users must besure that their applications conform to IBM's specification for Micro Channelarchitecture bus-mastering devices in a virtual 386 environment.andM;A few programs, such as Microsoft Windows 3.0, support IBM's specificationand thus do not need the driver.andP;  (See chart, at left.) Earlier versions ofthese products, however, don't work properly with the SCSI adapters unlessthe driver is installed, according to PC Week tests.andM;Applications that don't tap 386 virtual memory hardware features shouldoperate trouble-free without the driver.andP;  Programs that use DOS extenders arealso unlikely to fail, according to extender developers.andM;The PS/2 SCSI driver issue lies primarily with multitasking DOS operatingenvironments and 386 memory managers for 386s, because these classes ofsoftware work intimately with system memory, virtual memory and disk devices.andM;Bus-mastering seems to be at the root of IBM's SCSI problem.andP;  Such a devicetakes control of the PC bus to transfer data between the device and memorywithout involving the host PC.andP;  If a 386 application accesses a bus-masteringdevice incorrectly, it can fail or lock up a PC.andP;  For example, during PC Weektesting, Borland's Turbo Debugger and Turbo Profiler in 386 mode crashedwithout the driver.andM;Although they were unable to name a specific date, IBM officials said thatadditional information describing the 386 SCSI driver situation will beavailable soon.andM;----------Ben Myers owns Spirit of Performance Inc., a consulting firm in Harvard,Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
