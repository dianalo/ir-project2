Ernest F. Hollings.   ``The election campaign of last fall hit a new low,'' the SouthCarolina Democrat said Wednesday in pushing for a new law to combatthe effects of ``attack'' ads.   ``It left an odious trail with hit and run attacks, misleadingclaims, hidden players and a lack of discussion of the majorissues,'' he told the Senate Commerce communications subcommittee.   He noted voter turnout in the 1988 election was the lowest since1924, at just more than 50 percent, saying the public has beenturned off by virulent television spots that slash candidateswithout discussing substantive issues.   ``America knew more about Willie Horton than it did about eitherpresidential candidate,'' Hollings said. He was referring to adsattacking Democrat Michael Dukakis for a Massachusetts furloughprogram that freed a convict who later raped a woman.   Political analyst Curtis Gans illustrated the level of politicalrhetoric by showing ads ranging from Lyndon Johnson's famous 1964anti-Barry Goldwater message counting down to a nuclear explosion,to one against Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., in which a Fidel Castrolookalike lit a cigar with roll of American foreign aid dollars.   Hollings has introduced a bill along with Sens. Daniel Inouye,D-Hawaii, and John Danforth, R-Mo., to require broadcasters toprovide free air time to anyone targeted by a negative ad frompolitical action committees not connected with a candidate orpolitical party.   The bill also would require candidates to personally appear inany ad that mentions his or her opponent.   The subcommittee is considering another bill by Sens. RichardBryan, D-Nev., and Bob Graham, D-Fla., that would require politicalad sponsors to be clearly identified on the air.   Both bills are aimed mainly at PACs, which under federal law maymake direct campaign contributions of $5,000 in a primary and $5,000in the general election.   But special interests may spend unlimited amounts on campaigns aslong it is done without the knowledge or cooperation of thecampaigns and candidates that benefit from independent spending.   Hollings said his bill would help make ``the playing field morelevel'' by giving those attacked the means to respond. ``It in noway says to these independent parties that they cannot advertise,''he said.   He said the massive expenditures by the PACs _ $10 million onbroadcast ads in 1986 _ have driven up the costs of campaigns ascandidates take out their own ads to shoot back.   Except at one point when Hollings attacked Sen. Mitch McConnell,R-Ky., for ads depicting ``bloodhounds'' searching for an absenteeopponent, the senators Wednesday generally steered clear of thetouchy subject of negative ads carried out by their colleagues.   Several witnesses expressed First Amendment concerns about theHollings-Danforth bill. Former Republican Sen. Charles McC. Mathiasof Maryland and American Civil Liberties Union counsel Barry Lynnsaid the bill would involve the government in content regulation ofpolitical ads.   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said since challengers naturally mustattack the records of incumbents, the Hollings bill would``dramatically restrict'' the challenger's ability to wage acampaign.</TEXT></DOC>
