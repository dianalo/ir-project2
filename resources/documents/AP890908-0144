Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, whose agencyregulates about 4,000 federally-chartered banks, proposed a 3percent minimum capital standard, or leverage ratio, as part of alarger risk-based capital rule that takes effect at the end of 1990.   Capital put at risk by bank and Sandamp;L owners acts as a buffer,absorbing an institution's losses before federal deposit insurancekicks in. One of the key reforms in savings and loan legislationenacted last month was an increase in Sandamp;Ls' required capital levels.   Current rules require commerical banks to hold 6 percent capitalagainst their loans and other investments. However, under new rulestaking effect Dec. 31, 1990, banks will have to work up to 8 percentcapital.   But they won't have to have hold any capital against such nearlyriskless assets as cash and government securities and they will geta break on capital for investing in residential mortgages.   To prevent banks from using the risk-adjustments to severelyreduce their overall capital, Clarke on Friday proposed a 3 percentminimum standard, or leverage ratio.   However, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. WilliamSeidman, whose agency insures bank and Sandamp;L deposits, is pushing fora 6 percent leverage ratio as a floor beneath the 8 percentrisk-based standard.   Seidman, speaking to a group of lawyers and accountants, saidweak standards helped cause the savings and loan crisis and Clarke'sproposal would in effect weaken the standard for 90 percent of thenation's banks.   ``It's rather clear in my mind that ... changing standards toreduce capital did not work out well in the last experiment when wetried it,'' Seidman said, referring to a regulatory decision in theearly 1980s to reduce Sandamp;Ls' capital.   However, Clarke maintained his proposal was stricter than currentrules and said setting the leverage ratio too high would negate therisk-adjusted standard, removing the incentive banks have to moveinto less speculative investments.   He told reporters at a briefing that his position is supported byboth the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board, whichregulates bank holding companies.   Under the comptroller's proposal, about 800 of 13,500 state andfederal banks nationally will have to raise capital or restructuretheir portfolios, compared with 475 that are short now. Clarkeestimated more than 1,000 would fall short under Seidman's proposal.   The three bank regulators _ the comptroller, the Fed and the FDIC_ have traditionally coordinated their capital policies. Clarke saida common standard is desirable, but he was not committed toachieving an agreement before adopting rules for national banks,probably by the end of the year.   That raises the possibility that stricter rules would apply tostate-chartered banks whose primary regulator is the FDIC, puttingthe state banks at a competitive disadvantage.   The debate among banking regulators is further complicated by thenew Sandamp;L law requiring that Sandamp;L capital standards be ``no lessstringent'' than bank standards.   Sandamp;L regulators estimate that about 1,400 of 2,700 solvent thriftinstitutions would fail a 6 percent leverage ratio, while only 600would miss a 3 percent standard.</TEXT></DOC>
