Traders also were encouraged by signs that the Federal Reserve may be tightening credit further in an effort to keep a lid on inflationary expectations. &quot;There is a case to be made the Fed is doing some further credit tightening,&quot; said Robert G. Dederick, executive vice president of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. But he and others cautioned that the evidence remains unclear.    Prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds bounced back from an early morning slump to wind up with gains of about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. That followed Friday's huge two-point slump that came after a government report showing an unexpectedly large 0.7% surge in producer prices last month.    A sharp drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures-price index, which has become one of the most closely watched inflation barometers in the bond markets, &quot;was largely responsible for the market rally,&quot; said Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. David H. Resler, chief economist of Nomura Securities International Inc., agreed: &quot;It would have been surprising if the market hadn't improved after last week's sharp sell-off and the decline in the CRB index,&quot; yesterday.    Bond prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks largely because of the dollar's deep slump and a recent surge in commodity prices. Yesterday, however, the dollar firmed against most other major currencies, while the CRB index, which tracks 26 raw materials prices, fell 4.71 points to 230.88.    &quot;A lot of commodity markets have gotten overheated on speculative fever, reflecting the CRB index,&quot; said Peter Hegel, chief investment officer of Van Kampen Merritt Inc., a Lisle, Ill., investment banking concern. &quot;We don't see the inflationary spiral that the markets have focused on in recent months.&quot;    Speculation that the Federal Reserve is adopting a tougher credit policy grew because the interest rate on federal funds increased yesterday and the Fed took no action to drive the rate back down. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, hovered around 6 7/8% much of the day from an average of 6.67% in the week ended last Wednesday. This was the first time in more than two weeks that the Fed hadn't intervened in the credit markets.    The Fed &quot;appears to be leaning further in the direction of restraint&quot; in an effort to &quot;try to nip this inflation flareup in the bud,&quot; said David M. Jones, senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. He said that Fed officials probably were &quot;jolted&quot; by last Friday's report of a surge in producer prices and that they appear to be tightening credit now in the hope that such a move would remove the need for stronger medicine later. But he and other analysts still remain unsure whether the Fed has changed policy. &quot;It's a tough call,&quot; Mr. Jones said.    Some economists, though, contended that the Fed's absence from the market probably wasn't a sign of a credit-tightening move. They said the higher funds rate could merely be a temporary phenomenon caused by technical factors, and several predicted the funds rate will edge back down to about 6 1/2% in the next few days.    &quot;I would be very reluctant to read any policy moves into the Fed's absence from the market&quot; yesterday, said John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Group Inc. Mr. Resler of Nomura said the recent decline of Treasury cash balances would lessen the need for the Fed to add reserves.    The guessing game about Fed policy comes as the Fed's policy-making committee meets today for one of its regularly scheduled meetings to review credit strategy. Several analysts yesterday noted that the Fed often has initiated credit-tightening moves just before meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee.    Whatever the case, many analysts predict the Federal Reserve Board will raise the discount rate within a month or so, possibly in conjunction with interest-rate reductions by Japan and West Germany, as part of an international effort to bolster the dollar and stimulate world-wide trade. The discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, now stands at 5 1/2%.    Some forecasters say a discount-rate increase could come as early as today. But others insist that the Fed will wait until West Germany and Japan agree to lower their rates. &quot;I don't expect action on the discount rate before the Venice summit&quot; that begins June 8, said Rudolf Thunberg, an economist at Ried Thunberg andamp; Co., a Westport, Conn. investment research firm. &quot;The discount rate is a bargaining chip that can be used in negotiations with Japan and Germany.&quot;    &quot;The chances of a discount-rate increase grow with the inflation phobia,&quot; said Mr. Resler of Nomura. &quot;But I don't see it happening unless the Fed can obtain some concessions from Japan and West Germany in the process.&quot;    The Treasury's new 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 rose to 98 1/2 from 98 1/4 Friday, as the yield declined to 8.89% from 8.92%. The government's new 8 1/2% notes due 1997 edged up to 98 10/32 from 98 8/32, while the yield fell to 8.75% from 8.77%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds increased 1.83 points to 1262.09. It ranged between 1250.27 and 1265.28.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed from Friday. But rates on new bills sold by the government yesterday at its regular weekly auction were sharply higher than at the previous week's results and were the highest auction levels since last June.    The average rate on new 13-week bills rose to 6.03% from 5.47% at last week's sale. The average rate on new 26-week bills jumped to 6.34% from 5.74%.    Here are details of the Treasury bill auction yesterday:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                  13-Week          26-Week    Applications .......... $21,531,250,000  $20,502,200,000    Accepted bids .......... $6,405,090,000   $6,404,025,000    Accepted at low price ............. 88%              18%    Accepted noncompet'ly .. $1,039,295,000     $716,995,000    Average price (Rate) .... 98.476(6.03%)    96.795(6.34%)    High price (Rate) ....... 98.496(5.95%)    96.815(6.30%)    Low price (Rate) ........ 98.471(6.05%)    96.785(6.36%)    Coupon equivalent ............... 6.22%            6.66%   Both issues are dated May 21.
