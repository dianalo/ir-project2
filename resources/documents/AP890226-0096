On Monday, police arrested 15 dissidents who tried to march tothe U.S. Embassy to protest the Bush visit and present a lettercondemning the United States.   Bush arrived in Seoul on Monday for a five-hour visit to holdtalks with President Roh Tae-woo and to address the NationalAssembly. He later flies home to Washington.   In the southern city of Pusan Sunday, thousands of riot policesealed off a downtown temple, blocking an anti-American rally buttriggering violent street protests, the Yonhap news agency reported.   It said bands of protesters hurling firebombs and rocks foughtrunning street battles with police who fired tear gas. At least 34protesters were arrested, it said.   Similar clashes erupted in the western port city of Inchon whenpolice dispersed protesters trying to attend an anti-Bush rally,dissident sources said.   ``Bush, Yankee go home!'' hundreds of youths shouted as theypelted police with firebombs.   Four Korean reporters were injured when police brandishing clubscharged about 100 demonstrators trying to march from an Inchonchurch, Yonhap said.   In Sunchon, 168 miles south of Seoul, 20 youths firebombed anunoccupied prosecutors' office, smashing windows and burning somefixtures, Yonhap also reported.   Dissidents and radical students have called for demonstrationsagainst the Roh government and Bush's visit, but their rallies havedrawn only small numbers.   South Korea's 120,000 police have been placed on top alert.   On Monday, police maintained tight security around U.S.facilities to guard against threatened radical attacks.   About 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carryingpictures of Bush with red crosses drawn through them were seized andhauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the U.S.Embassy in downtown Seoul.   ``No Bush visit,'' the small band shouted before they wereoverwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of theprotesters.   Minutes after the protest, Bush's helicopter passed overhead onits way to the nearby presidential mansion, the Blue House, to bereceived by Roh.   Three dissident leaders attempted to walk peacefully to theembassy moments after the protest was broken up by riot police. Butthe police blocked the sidewalk and eventually dragged the leadersaway.   ``We're trying to deliver this letter,'' shouted dissident leaderLee Bu-yong, waving it above his head as dozens of riot trooperssurrounded him.   The letter, released earlier by the nation's main dissidentalliance, denounced the United States as the main source of divisionand strife in South Korea. It called for the withdrawal of all U.S.forces from South Korea and charged that Washington ruled the nationlike a colony.   ``U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to Koreanpeople since the division of the Korean peninsula,'' the letter said.   The radicals claim Roh's government is a military dictatorshipcontrolled by the United States. They want to oust Roh and expellthe 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defensetreaty.   ``The United States is scheming, through Bush's visit, toperpetuate the division of the Korean peninsula, stabilize themilitary dictatorship and heighten tensions,'' said the UnitedNational Democratic Movement of Korea, the main dissident alliance.   Radical students have little public support because of theirextreme views, but they can assemble thousands of activists andoften clash with riot police in Seoul and other cities.</TEXT></DOC>
