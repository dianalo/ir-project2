The reviewfocuses on the sources, concentrations, and changes of those gases mostdirectly linked to human activities, i.e., carbon dioxide, ozone, andthe chlorofluorocarbons; the direct physical effects of changes in tracegases; and the impacts of rising concentrations of trace gases. The reviewdiscusses the uncertainties associated with the knowledge of currenttrends and possible future changes, including ozone trends and the Antarcticozone hole, and the impacts of rising concentrations of trace gases.</TEXT></DOC>
