And yet last October severalHaitians here -- staff and guests at the Oloffson Hotelwatching the Senate nomination hearings on CNN -- sympathizedwith Judge Thomas. They fancied the possibility of anAfro-American being on the U.S. Supreme Court, despite thefact that most believed Anita Hill was telling the truth.   On Feb. 24, after initially dissenting from the SupremeCourt's decision authorizing forced repatriation of Haitianboat people, Justice Thomas switched sides and joined sevenother court justices in refusing to review their earlierdecision. Justice Thomas said that he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot;by allegations of mistreatment of those forced back, but that&quot;this matter must be addressed by the political branches, forour role is limited to questions of law.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Of course, legally, Justice Thomas is right. He and hisassociates on the Supreme Court are merely ruling on lawsmade and upheld by the other two branches of government. Butwhat all branches of the U.S. government fail to recognize isthat Haiti has become a case to which current U.S.immigration law cannot be applied. Haiti today is a dangerousplace for everybody, not just a select group of designatedpolitical refugees. It is dangerous for repatriated Haitians,for Haitians who never left their country, and even forforeign reporters who investigate allegations of mistreatmentof those forced back.   Unfortunately for the fate of boat people, the mediasearch for the repatriated-cum-mistreated was mainlyfruitless: Journalists cannot simply approach those dumped onthe pier amid a strong army and police presence and ask themabout their political beliefs; many returnees fear going backto their hometowns or have nothing to return to; visiting anysuch person is to expose him; any abuses will more likelyhappen once the &quot;blan&quot; (white person), with notebook orcamera, is gone.   These same difficulties would arise if the U.S. Embassyhere were to do any serious monitoring. As it stands now,this is only a hypothesis because, as one of the participantson a blitz-visit to Haiti on Feb. 18 -- Rep. Donald M. Payne(D., N.J.) -- pointed out during the House Foreign AffairsCommittee hearings last week: &quot;The State Department iscorrect: We have no knowledge of any kind of infractions ofhuman rights for returning Haitians. It's right because wehave no system {for monitoring such abuses}.&quot;   The repression nowadays might not be as bad as it wasimmediately after the Sept. 30 military coup that forcedPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide into exile. The record ofmore than 1,000 people killed in a month (with many otherswounded or beaten) is hard to exceed. But fewer killings arestill killings, fewer beatings are still beatings. And whende facto Prime Minister Jean-Jacques Honorat says that hisgovernment &quot;did not arrest, torture or persecute anybody,&quot; heis simply lying.   Wherever one goes in the countryside, one meets people whohave recently suffered some kind of physical abuse byauthorities. In Pont Sonde, 70 miles north of Port-au-Prince,I listen for more than an hour to half a dozen men in hiding,who pour out their personal stories of arrests, beatings,threats, extortions or falling victim to racketeeringschemes. One man, an electrician and organizer of Mr.Aristide's electoral campaign in Port-au-Prince, was arrestedby plainclothes policemen in February (when he came out ofhiding to look for his wife and children), tortured for threedays and released after 16 days. He is still in pain andsuspects that his ribs are broken, but he does not dare tosee a doctor.   After hearing this man's story I reflect that while thisis all very sad, indeed tragic, incidents like this cannotmake the U.S. Supreme Court change its decision; althoughconfirmed, these incidents do not concern repatriated people.But I feel ashamed for having such a thought. Perhaps thecourt's impersonal style of reasoning is catching, like adeadly virus.   Farther to the northwest, in Drouin, a village on the bankof the Artibonite River, residents show me threemud-and-wattle houses burned by local soldiers and belongingto President Aristide's supporters, including the home ofDrouin's elected mayor, who has been in hiding since theincident happened three months ago. Had the mayor taken tothe sea and then been turned down by U.S. immigration, maybehis story would have convinced the Supreme Court. As it was,he is merely a terrorized victim.   In Rossignol, a hamlet down the river, a rice farmerappropriately named Dangervie recounts his 20-year-oldbrother's death last December. Twenty soldiers arrivedcarrying M-1s and Uzis, set 21 houses afire, arrested threemen and killed Kesner Dangervie, who was helping a blind manwhile most other residents fled. Unfortunately, Kesner nevertried to escape to the U.S. -- so his death is not to thepoint either, as far as U.S. law is concerned.   In Cazale, a village a few miles off the main nationalroad, the family of Frederique Alberic murdered in thebeginning of February tells me that he was killed because hestood up in defense of peasants who refused to pay extrabribes for using water. What a shame that he was not a formerboat person; his death might have met the criteria of U.S.political-refugee status, instead of just adding to the deathtoll of terror by thugs.   These are the more dramatic stories, but every person Ispeak to has tales that describe the general atmosphere: Withtotal impunity, soldiers (and especially the local chefs desection -- sheriffs) arrest people on a whim, extort ransoms,beat passers-by -- in short, run their own fiefdoms. This isthe country to which the U.S. is repatriating refugees, at arate of 2,000 a week -- the maximum that Haitian authoritiescan process.   I speak with U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Beardsworth whilewatching one such operation. His cutter, the Mohawk, has justbrought 264 Haitian boat people back to Port-au-Prince. Afterthe disembarkment, the captain snaps, &quot;Time to get out ofthis Dodge City.&quot; His description is so bloody right I justwish he could convey it to Justice Thomas, members ofCongress and State Department personnel who, safely back inWashington, limit their role to &quot;questions of law.&quot;   ---   Ms. Husarska, a Polish journalist, is a writer at The NewRepublic and a fellow at the School of Public Affairs of theUniversity of Maryland.</TEXT></DOC>
