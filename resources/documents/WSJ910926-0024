The company didn't specify how large the loss would be,but the quarter is going much worse than analysts expected.Most analysts had been forecasting that the company wouldhave a modest loss of about one cent a share for the period.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to declining sales and price competition,Seagate said restructuring charges and severance costsassociated with recent layoffs and other steps will hamperresults in the quarter.   The projected loss is the latest of a string of stumblesby the company, a pioneer in the disk-drive industry that hasbeen mauled recently by competitors such as ConnerPeripherals Inc. and Quantum Corp. Those companies haveconsistently beaten Seagate to market with new productsincorporating technological advances. Last week, Seagate'spresident, Dennis T. Mitchell, resigned, apparently underpressure from the company's board.   Seagate's stock has been pounded by the problems. Ittraded at more than $14 a share as recently as April, butclosed at $8.625 a share yesterday, down 37.5 cents innational over-the-counter trading.</TEXT></DOC>
