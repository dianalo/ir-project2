The emissions of nitrogen oxidesincreased heavily during the 1950s and the 1960s. Since 1980 they havedecreased. The aim of the Swedish government is to reduce sulphur dioxideemissions by not less than 65% and nitrogen oxides emissions by 30% betweenthe years 1980 and 1995. Swedish emissions of hydrocarbons are projectedto decrease by about 30% between 1980 and 1995. Emissions must be reduced,not only in Sweden but all over Europe, if damage from acidificationand air pollution is to be avoided.</TEXT></DOC>
