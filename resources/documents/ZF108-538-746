Parsons, deputyassistant director of the Defense Logistics Agency's Office of InformationSystems and Technology, told a DLA conference in April that the agency isplanning to merge as many as 20 centers into about five.andM;Except for the Viable requirement, Colver said the SBIS program remains aplan by which the Army will call upon an integrator to devise an open systemsarchitecture, complete the first module of that architecture and then beginto contract out subsequent modules.andM;Officials have described SBIS as the hardware and networking infrastructurethat will support the Army's standard software applications foradministrative processing.andP;  Officials expect to eliminate &quot;the strikingamount of duplication and redundancy in software we've found throughout theArmy,&quot; Colver said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
