The stock marketis jittery. But in Washington, a sense of urgency is notablylacking. The Bush administration says it will wait until nextyear to push any new economic proposals. Congress focuses ona side issue, stampeding toward, then retreating from,interest-rate caps on credit cards.   While political leaders are cautious and confused,business leaders are mainly exasperated. In an informalsampling of corporate leaders around the country, The WallStreet Journal found almost universal anger with Congress,and widespread exasperation with President Bush. Here's howsome of them grade Congress and the president on the economyso far, and what steps, if any, they think the federalgovernment should take to boost the recovery.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>             Chief Executive, Home Depot Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;You've heard the thing about Nero fiddling while Romeburned. Well, President Bush is fiddling while he's going tovacate the White House. The fact that he is surrounded byadvisers who think the economy is in recovery is incredible.&quot;   Mr. Marcus says the recent market plunges are moreaccurate reflections of the state of the economy than theproclamations from the White House. &quot;I'm Republican, and I'mvery depressed by his inability to take control and be aleader in this situation. If I were president, I would holdCongress in session, and I'd say, `I'm not letting anyone gountil we find something that creates jobs. Not handouts.People want to go back to work.'&quot;   Along with ideas like lowering the capital-gains tax andmaking IRAs more attractive, Mr. Marcus says the economy'sproblems could be addressed by lowering taxes for the middleclass. &quot;We're taxing them to death,&quot; he says. &quot;People areworse off today than they were seven years ago.   &quot;If something doesn't happen to create jobs in Americaover the next six months, Mr. Bush will join Mr. Carter as aone-term president. The Iraqi war is history. People careabout feeding their families.   &quot;I'd give Mr. Bush a C-minus and Congress a D-plus --they're both terrible.&quot;                                                                                                                           CHARLES L. DEMONEY              Chief Executive, MGM Grand Air                                                                                                          &quot;My best grade for the president would be a C on theeconomy. I don't think there is a well-thought-out recoveryplan&quot; in the administration. &quot;For the past three days, we'veheard rhetoric of `hold the line' from the administration viathe vice president. They're saying, `Everything's fine. We'rejust adjusting.' The populace is growing weary of this talk.&quot;   As for Congress, Mr. Demoney says, he would give it an F.&quot;It's out of control. Legislators are looking after their owninterests without seeing the big picture of turning thecountry around from exorbitant spending to a balanced budget.I don't think there's the leadership in Congress to directthe turnaround.   &quot;We need to wake up the population to guide Congress to dothe right thing about unemployment, replacement of lost jobs,getting real estate moving again. Credit needs to be put inthe reach of more people and businesses in the country. Banksare overreacting by tightening credit. Small businesses needto at least be put in touch with borrowing again.   &quot;We need somebody to lead an economic recovery, and Ithink President Bush is the one to do it. At times of crisis,he has led the world. Things like the extension ofunemployment benefits are a Band-Aid. We need a game plan totake to Congress, and say, `We need to do this.'&quot;   The stock market &quot;is about as confused as I am&quot; about theeconomy, says Mr. Demoney. &quot;The stock market reflects theoverall malaise that's set in.&quot;                                                                                                                               HENRY NOZKO            President and Chairman, Acmat Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;I'm probably tainted because I'm a heavy supporter ofBush,,&quot; says Mr. Nozko, whose company is a buildings interiorcontractor and construction insurance firm in New Britain,Conn. &quot;He's not acting like the George Bush I know on theeconomy. Six months ago, he announced we were in a recovery.I just don't know how he could have had a, let's call it amisunderstanding, like that. I've been a CEO for 41 years. Ifeel this is the worst recession we've ever had, particularlyin New England and particularly in construction.   &quot;I'd give him an A-plus because I really think he's goingto wake up. If he doesn't, I'd give him a D or an E.   &quot;I would grade Congress as absolutely incompetent. Termlimits -- we sure as hell need those very fast in thiscountry.&quot;   As for policy, &quot;I suggest cuts in the Pentagon anddefense, but then converting that into construction. Theindustry has 27% unemployment. Someone in Washington has torealize they have to pump money into that. Our infrastructureneeds it. Our bridges are falling down and our roads aredeteriorating.   &quot;The stock market is trying to send a signal to PresidentBush. I don't think it wanted to go down 500 points. But Ithink it is trying to tell us the economy isn't gettingbetter.&quot;                                                                                                                           JOHN G. MEDLIN JR.              Chief Executive, Wachovia Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;I'd give Mr. Bush a B. The president has tried to bringus toward a more solid footing on the economy, and make itmore market-driven.   &quot;His biggest fault has been compromising with theDemocratic leadership on economic issues, and the budget andtax package last year. The tax increases have made therecession worse and slowed the recovery.&quot;   A &quot;lifelong Democrat,&quot; Mr. Medlin places most of the blamefor the economic woes on Congress. &quot;They're totally inept atcontrolling government spending.&quot;   Mr. Medlin's advice? &quot;I would urge the president to go foran across-the-board flat freeze on spending&quot; and keep itfrozen until the deficit shrinks. &quot;It's going to take aradical solution. The private sector has had to cut itspayroll and its expenses to be more efficient, but thefederal government hasn't.   &quot;The stock market reflects the fact that the majorlegislation of this Democratic leadership basically reflectsan anti-business Congress and an anti-growth Congress. In theshort run, if Congress will go home and stop doing badthings, the market would probably improve. But I don't thinkit will improve in a substantial way until the economy andcorporate earnings improve.&quot;                                                                                                                             JOHN V. CLEARY        Chief Executive, Green Mountain Power Corp.                                                                                                          President Bush's economic performance rates &quot;slightlyabove average -- a seven on a scale of 10,&quot; says Mr. Cleary,whose company is an electric utility in Burlington, Vt. &quot;Oneof his biggest contributions is vetoing some of thesespending bills.   &quot;Congress is considerably lower -- maybe a three. Theyseem to show constant interest in expanding the government.This credit-card fiasco is one example of that.   &quot;I'd suggest President Bush hold the line on spending andprobably reduce the government more if he could. Try tostimulate the economy, maybe by reintroducing investment taxcredits.   &quot;I think the stock market is very confused by the mixedsignals from Congress. I view what happened Friday as meaningthey just lack confidence, mainly with Congress. &quot;                                                                                                                               JOHN JUSTIN          Chief Executive, Justin Industries Inc.                                                                                                          Mr. Justin says President Bush has done &quot;fairly well&quot; onthe economy. &quot;I'd give him a B. He's fairly well left italone.&quot;   Congress, on the other hand, he would &quot;grade pretty low.I'd say a D. They're just trying to get into every part of{the economy} and regulate everything. I don't think in acountry this big you can do that.   &quot;If we leave the economy alone we'd be better off. Whenthey try to do things, like trying to limit interest rates onbank cards, then they find out if they do that there probablywon't be bank cards.   &quot;When business gets down a little, they say the governmentought to do something about it,&quot; says Mr. Justin, whosecompany makes boots, bricks and building materials. &quot;And whenbusiness gets too high, they say government ought to dosomething about it. Well, if they just leave it alone, Ithink it takes care of itself.&quot;                                                                                                                             JOHN W. UHLMANN                  President, Uhlmann Co.                                                                                                          &quot;I'd give Bush's performance on the economy an F-minus,&quot;says Mr. Uhlmann. &quot;I think Bush has failed as a president.The presidency is about leadership, and Bush has failed hisrole.   &quot;Bush has no principles that he believes in. He is aknee-jerk reactionary; he reacts to everything the Congressdoes. He has done nothing to defend the free-market system.   &quot;I think Congress doesn't understand how the real worldworks. They don't even place themselves under the laws of thereal world. The Democrats have been forcefully putting theirinept economic agenda into practice. At least Congress knowswhat it's consciously doing, unlike Bush. What Congress isdoing to the economy is conscious, and in line with theirphilosophy, and they have the added advantage that if itworks they get the credit; if it doesn't, Bush takes theblame. That's why I give Congress an F-plus.   &quot;I think it's almost too late for Bush. I really wonder ifthere's anything he can do. He has abandoned every principleof the Republican Party to appease the Democrats. To come upwith a pro-growth program, which would probably include acapital-gains tax, would go against everything he's done.He'll have to talk about reducing the role of government inthe economy. He needs to listen to Jack Kemp and get him outfront. I would tell Bush to fire {Budget Director Richard}Darman -- if anyone worked for me who gave me such badadvice, I would fire him. Dick Darman has to go -- and{Treasury Secretary Nicholas} Brady.   &quot;The stock market is saying that there's concern about thepolitical leadership, that they can't keep poisoning theeconomy.   &quot;We're in the food business {in Kansas City, Mo.}, so Ithink our prospects aren't negative. I do have concern aboutthe continued mandating of policies against business.&quot;                                                                                                                             GLENN SCHAEFFER          President and Chief Financial Officer,              Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;I'd say Bush's policy has been one of benign neglect, soI'd give him a gentleman's C. I should preface that a littleby saying it's not clear to me what a president can do toturn an economy around quickly.   &quot;It's been a no-action Congress. Congress is in a betterposition to change the economy, and there's been a real lackof leadership on key economic issues.   &quot;I'd advise the president to press for a capital-gains taxcut for a specific period of time, which in the past hasshown it will deliver a fair amount of revenue in a hurry. Imight marry that idea with a short-term tax cut that wouldbenefit the middle-class taxpayer. The problem we're in isthat we are actually seeing a rising tax burden in the midstof a recessionary environment, which is a double whammy.   &quot;What the market is saying about the economy in general isthat it's given up on the idea that a consumer recovery isclose at hand. It was wishful thinking.   &quot;What politicians do is use moral suasion on the economy.You declare victory, then move on. It's an old politicaltrick, but it didn't work this time.   &quot;Just lowering interest rates isn't enough. You can't sellsomething to a customer who doesn't want it at any price. Weneed to find a way to put more money in people's pockets.   &quot;A lot of companies planned for the archetypal 11-monthrecession, and held their breath as long as they could. Thenlater this summer, they started laying people off. Thatsecond round has had a severe effect. And retail andentertain ment businesses, those that depend on discretionaryspending, have felt the second round harder.   As president of Circus Circus, a casino operator in LasVegas, Nev., he says, &quot;In our industry, and with our company,the market always tends to overreact in one direction oranother. At some point, the consumer will lose fear. He orshe will have saved some money, and will not be afraid oflosing his or her job, and start spending.&quot;                                                                                                                            SAMUEL C. BUTLER        Presiding Partner, Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore                                                                                                          The economy is suffering from the incredible &quot;debt binge&quot;of the '80s, Mr. Butler says. He gives President Bush a D andadds, &quot;Whatever I give Bush, I give Congress two grades belowthat.   &quot;Between them there's no leadership on the economy.Nothing is a matter of principle. Everything is a matter ofpolitical expediency. I despair of the political leadershipin this country.&quot; Mr. Butler says he supports a gasoline taxto be used in rebuilding the nation's infrastructure as wellas for debt reduction.   As for his own business, he says the New York law firm hasbecome more cost-conscious and has reduced its service staffthrough attrition. &quot;Our corporate department has been as slowas it has been in 30 years.&quot; But he adds that the litigationdepartment is going strong.                                                                                                                            ROBERT W. MAHONEY               Chief Executive, Diebold Inc.                                                                                                          Mr. Mahoney gives President Bush a C-minus on the economy.But he slaps Congress with an F, because &quot;they're so wrappedup in party politics that they haven't focused on what theyneed to do.&quot;   Mr. Mahoney suggests that Mr. Bush seek bipartisan supportfor a package to slash federal employment, including themilitary, by 35%. &quot;I know all these bureaucracies serve afunction. But don't you think we could do the same thing with35% fewer people?&quot;   Mr. Mahoney also wants Mr. Bush to cut corporate taxes,cut the capital-gains tax to 10% below an individual'sregular tax rate, and provide economic incentives forentrepreneurs to open shop in inner cities, whereunemployment is highest.   The stock market, Mr. Mahoney says, is accurately saying,&quot;We don't see a clear light at the end of the tunnel of thisrecession in 1992, unless the government takes a pro-activerole to drive this economy.&quot;                                                                                                                           H. LAURANCE FULLER               Chief Executive, Amoco Corp.                                                                                                          Mr. Fuller gives President Bush a B. &quot;I would fault theadministration on the communications side&quot; and its inabilityto get important economic legislation passed.   Mr. Fuller gives Congress a C-minus. &quot;It's hard to beanything but negative.&quot; He cites a lack of leadership andlong-term decision making or planning.   His advice to the president: &quot;I wouldn't force ashort-term fix.&quot; He adds: &quot;I don't think playing around withtaxes is an option we can afford at this time. I don't thinkwe should have knee-jerk reactions&quot; to the slump. &quot;There'sevidence we're coming out of the recession.&quot;   Still, he is disappointed that there seems to be littlelong-term economic planning. &quot;I don't see a longer-termprogram that will encourage long-term investment andsavings.&quot;   He says the stock market is valuing the economy and theoil industry accurately. &quot;The oil industry is in a difficulttime, particularly in the U.S. There's the uncertainty ofnatural gas and oil prices and large spending onenvironmentalism. In the long range, investments in the oilbusiness will pay off very nicely.&quot;                                                                                                                            EDWARD B. BRANDON           Chief Executive, National City Corp.                                                                                                          Mr. Brandon says he won't grade President Bush on theeconomy because the president isn't responsible for boom andbust cycles. But he says Congress deserves a D. &quot;Congress isobsessed by issues of regulation and punishment and fixingblame and dilutive social programs which aren't effective. Idon't remember the last constructive piece of legislationthat body has passed.&quot;   Mr. Bush should take steps to convince the public that&quot;things aren't nearly as bad&quot; as people think. Mr. Brandon,chief of a Cleveland-based bank holding company, says Mr.Bush could spur the economy by speeding up spending alreadybudgeted.</TEXT></DOC>
