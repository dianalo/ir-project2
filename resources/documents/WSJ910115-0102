I was introduced to a man who managed theBNE agency there. &quot;What do you do here for Bank of NewEngland?&quot; I asked.   &quot;I try to persuade them to close this office,&quot; he said.&quot;We have no business being here -- never made any money andnever will.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   BNE went under because it was incompetently managed, butthat incompetence was magnified by the bank's need to keepreaching far out for loans. Like New York, Boston has toomany banks.   To such problems, market economies -- unlike commandeconomies -- offer a solution. The firms that lose the mostmoney fail, and survivors divide up whatever profitablebusiness used to be theirs. Eventually, the number of firmsis reduced to a point where all can make a living onavailable business. At that point, but surely not before it,it may even be possible to find capital for survivors.Prospective returns justify investment.   But American banks are exempt from the market economy. Ifthey fail, they aren't allowed to close their doors, becausethe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees theirdeposits. The FDIC won't permit the market to eliminateovercapacity.   When a large bank fails today, the FDIC takes it over,buys or guarantees its bad loans, and subsidizes some farawayPrince Charming to assume all liabilities. With a balancesheet made pure and strong by government assistance, theresurrected bank returns under new ownership to do battle inthe marketplace -- where, inevitably, it just destroys theother banks in its area. Those banks are still carrying aheavy weight of bad loans and nonperforming assets.   This is what happened in Texas, where the FDIC absolutelyrefused to liquidate any bank with assets larger than amedium-sized cattle spread. Out of 246 banks that failed inTexas in 1988 and 1989, the FDIC closed the doors on only 36.Overcapacity was rigorously maintained, with predictableresults. The weakest banks failed first; the FDICrecapitalized them with government subsidies and tax breaks,and kept them in the market -- and the next weakest banksfailed second. The FDIC then paid outside bank holdingcompanies to come pick up these failures. Newcomers quicklydestroyed all but one of the survivors among the 10 largestTexas banks.   Now the FDIC will bring Texas to Massachusetts. A deal isto be struck that is attractive enough to make Bank ofAmerica, or Banc One, or somebody like that willing to ownBank of New England. Thanks to the government subsidy the newBNE will be able to pay more for deposits and charge less forloans than its rivals in the Boston market. The only questionis which of those rivals will fail first.   The securities markets seem to have bet on Bank of Boston;its bonds and preferred stock dropped almost 20% in price theday after the FDIC announced its plans. Then the FDIC canrevive a failed Bank of Boston, and Shawmut or Bay Banks willfail, too. The FDIC fund is effectively insolvent on almostany analysis of its contingent liabilities (interestingly,the FDIC's most recent annual report, for 1989, fails for thefirst time to print the opinion given its board by theGeneral Accounting Office, which audits its books). Each newfailure will cost the taxpayer a separate bundle.   The proper description for this activity is &quot;insane.&quot; Onecan defend, though I wouldn't, the FDIC's decision to coverall of what were legally uninsured deposits of more than$100,000 in BNE. One can argue that the FDIC should commitsignificant resources to support an orderly liquidation ofBNE with minimal disruption to borrowers. (This would be abig improvement on what happened in Texas, where FirstRepublic was given to North Carolina-based NCNB -- knownlocally as &quot;Nobody Cares, Nobody Bothers&quot; -- and the NorthCarolinians shattered some more of the Texas economy bycalling every loan in sight.) But there is no defensibleargument for frustrating the healing action of the market anddeliberately spreading an epidemic of insolvency through astate's financial system.   ---   Mr. Mayer is author of &quot;The Greatest-Ever Bank Robbery:The Collapse of the Savings and Loan Industry&quot; (Scribners).</TEXT></DOC>
