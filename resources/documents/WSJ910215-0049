The ruling was a partial victory for U.S. makers whopetitioned for the investigation. The Commerce Department,which based its findings on information supplied by theJapanese companies, recommended a modest duty of 4.6% fordisplay screens from Sharp Corp., the largest Japanesesupplier. The department ruled that Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co., another major supplier, wasn't selling itsscreens at below-market prices.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. producers, represented by the Advanced DisplayManufacturers of America, argued that the duties should be ashigh as 71% to 318%.   The ruling also recommended duties of 1.46% on displaysfrom Toshiba Corp. and 2.33% on those from several otherJapanese producers, including Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd.,Kyocera Corp., Seiko-Epson Corp. and NEC Corp. HosidenElectronics Corp. also wasn't found to be selling at belowhome-market prices. Duties are intended to offset theallegedly unfair price advantage importers have over U.S.producers.   A department official said these findings still must beverified by a team of U.S. investigators. The team, whichwill include accountants and industry analysts, is expectedto go to Japan at the end of the month.   Compaq Computer Corp., one of several U.S. computermanufacturers that opposed the ADMA petition, said it is&quot;pleased&quot; by the department's preliminary findings. The U.S.computer industry is major user of these displays, whichtypically are incorporated into its laptop models andelectronic notebooks.   The petitioners say they are confident on-siteinvestigation of Japanese production costs will support theirclaims. After the Commerce Department completes itsinvestigation, the recommended duties are likely to &quot;increasesignificantly,&quot; said James Hurd, a spokesman for ADMA.   In a separate trade matter, the administration called foran international trade panel to resolve a dispute with theEuropean Community over German subsidies for the Europeanconsortium, Airbus Industrie.   The U.S. action came after months of fruitlessnegotiations with the EC on various formulas for minimizingBonn's practice of compensating Airbus's German partner, nowowned by Daimler-Benz AG, for losses caused by exchange-ratefluctuations. The German subsidies are &quot;wholly inconsistent&quot;with the Subsidies Code agreed to by members of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, U.S. Trade RepresentativeCarla Hills said.   A GATT panel is expected within 60 days to rule on theU.S. demand for a termination of these subsidies. If thepanel rules in Washington's favor, Bonn would be requiredunder GATT to comply or face possible trade sanctions.   The EC, reacting to Washington's call for a panel, said itwould &quot;inevitably increase trade tensions&quot; and add to a&quot;climate of uncertainty&quot; over the world aircraft market.</TEXT></DOC>
