There are two possibleclasses of two-body final states: (i) neutralino or chargino plus a W,Z, or Higgs boson; and (ii) channels involving squarks or sleptons. Theimportant features of these decays are illustrated and their phenomenologicalimplications discussed. The two-body decay into the lightest Higgs bosonis almost always present, and enhances the heavy-quark component of thefinal state. In addition, two-body-decay branching ratios into a W orZ can be large for the heaviest charginos and neutralinos.</TEXT></DOC>
