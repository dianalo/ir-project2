Records indicate the agency also appears to have contacted a smaller brokerage firm, Dominick andamp; Dominick Inc., which did business in the early 1980s with Ellis, a Swiss brokerage firm. Albert Dreyfuss -- the brother of George Dreyfuss, one of the co-owners of Ellis -- works in Dominick's office in Basel, Switzerland. It is believed that Dominick is one of the firms named in the SEC's formal request to the Swiss government for information.    Frederic Boyce, a Dominick compliance official, said the firm has a policy of not talking to the media.    SEC officials handling the Ellis case declined to comment. There is no indication that the SEC believes there was any wrongdoing regarding the Ellis matter by the firms receiving subpoenas.    An official with Merrill Lynch, of New York, confirmed receipt of the subpoena but declined to elaborate.    An official at Smith Barney, which did millions of dollars of business with Ellis during the early 1980s, said none of the accounts named in the subpoena received by his firm are currently at the firm. Smith Barney is a unit of Primerica Corp., of Greenwich, Conn.    It couldn't be determined exactly how many subpoenas the SEC sent out during the past month. One securities lawyer said he heard the agency issued a &quot;bunch,&quot; and added, &quot;this is the first anybody's heard of Ellis in ages.&quot;    The SEC investigation of stock and option trading through Zurich-based Ellis in about 100 U.S. corporate takeovers dates back more than five years. In 1984, an SEC staff attorney called the case the largest insider-trader inquiry in the agency's history. Others close to the investigation said they believed profits in question totaled more than $40 million, which would make it one of the biggest insider cases ever.    Swiss authorities denied the SEC's first two requests for information, made in 1984 and 1985. The Swiss approved the third request, but the response to the SEC was delayed a year by defendants' appeals.    Last year, however, the Swiss Supreme Court rejected Ellis's second appeal seeking to block authorities from turning over information to the SEC. The agency's recent round of subpoenas seems to have been spurred by that new data, said a former SEC attorney, who currently works on Wall Street. &quot;It's clear that they were stymied before, and it's clear they've got something now,&quot; he said.    In Zurich, George Dreyfuss, one of the co-owners of Ellis, said he doesn't know what information has been given to the SEC. He referred all other questions to Claude Dreifuss, the other co-owner, who couldn't be reached for comment. Last April, Mr. Dreifuss denied that Ellis was ever involved in insider trading.    In addition to the SEC inquiry, the Ellis matter is being investigated by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigations subcommittee. That panel, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), plans hearings to use the Ellis situation as a case study of how alleged insider traders can hide behind a foreign entity. The subcommittee's investigation may also seek to raise questions about the SEC's ability to pursue insider trading in any form. </TEXT></DOC>
