Florida's steady population gains have moved it from 10th place since 1960. Texas is the only other state among the 10 biggest to move up significantly in the past 26 years; it rose to third from sixth place in 1960, the census agency said. But three states -- Alaska, Arizona and Nevada -- have added residents at a faster clip than Florida since 1980.    In 10 Farm and Energy Belt states, population losses occurred for the first time during the 1980s or persisted from 1985 to 1986. They are: Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kentucky, Montana, Idaho, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Wyoming.    The industrial Midwestern states, however, experienced increases in population from 1985 to 1986 as their economies continued rebounding, according to the report. </TEXT></DOC>
