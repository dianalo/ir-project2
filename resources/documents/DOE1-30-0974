The objective of this projectis to provide a prototype for implementing CAI as an enhancement to existingNALDA training. The CAI prototype project is being performed in phases.The task undertaken in Phase I was to analyze the problem and the alternativesolutions and to develop a set of recommendations on how best to proceed.In Phase II a structured design and specification document was completedthat will provide the basis for development and implementation of thedesired CAI system. Phase III will consist of designing, developing,and testing a user interface which will extend the features of the PhaseII prototype. The design of the CAI prototype has followed a rigorousstructured analysis based on Yourdon/DeMarco methodology and InformationEngineering tools. This document includes data flow diagrams, a datadictionary, process specifications, an entity-relationship diagram, acurriculum description, special function key definitions, and a set ofstandards developed for the NALDA CAI Prototype.</TEXT></DOC>
