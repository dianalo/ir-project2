Rockefellerwould likely get frequent mention.andP;  Yet if you were to check the index of atreatise on the evolution of the American Constitutional system, you probablywouldn't find their names.andP;  Names you almost certainly would find include E.andO;H. Harriman, James J. Hill, and J. P. Morgan--all for the simple reason thatthey controlled railroads.andM;It's difficult for us today to fully comprehend the critical role played byrailroads in the United States throughout the late 19th and early 20thCenturies.andP;  Functioning as the airplanes, automobiles, and long-haul trucksof the day, they also comprised the nation's basic communications network aswell, for they sorted and transported the mail.andP;  (Otherwise there was onlythe telegraph--relatively speedy, yes, but also expensive and limited in whatit could convey.andP;  Long-distance telephone conversation would have to wait forLee De Forest's 1912 invention of the amplifier; not until 1915 was itpossible to make a call from one coast to the other.)andP;  The rail magnates, asa result, were not only their era's Frank Lorenzos, but its John Sculleys aswell.andM;The vast reaches of the American West, in particular, could scarcely havebeen settled and developed without the railroads.andP;  I remember mentioning onceto my mother that the trip from the Nebraska hamlet in which she grew up tothe larger town nearby, where there were such essentials as dentists anddepartment stores--all of eighteen miles, but along roads that were littlemore than trails--must have constituted quite an adventure.andP;  &quot;Oh, no&quot;, washer reply, &quot;we took the train.&quot;andP;  It was that simple.andM;But in the history of the period it is documented that relations between thepopulace and the railroads were far from rosy.andP;  While the lines were stillbeing constructed, railroad owners were not above extorting concessions fromcommunities along their routes, making liberal use of the threat to bypassthem.andP;  Often, towns that found themselves so stranded were obliged to pick upand move--buildings and all--to locations along the tracks.andP;  Denver evenresorted to financing its own connecting line to the Union Pacific some 100miles distant--no small feat for a struggling frontier town of barely fivethousand souls.andP;  But the alternative would have been ruin.andM;Although the public may have looked upon the railroads as vital lifelines,their proprietors--being good 19th-century businessmen, after all--viewedthem as properties to be exploited for profit, and manipulated ratesaccordingly.andP;  Things turned even worse when the spiritual ancestors oftoday's corporate raiders appeared on the scene.andP;  What followed was asuccession of bruising battles for control of the lines.andM;Squeezed by exorbitant passenger fares and freight rates, its communities andbusinesses utterly dependent on the ultimate fate of &quot;its&quot; railroad in thecorporate warfare taking place on Wall Street, the public attempted to fightback.andP;  In the Midwest, especially, voters elected legislatures with agrarianradical majorities determined to bring the railroads under public control.andO;Thus, the stage was set for a struggle that was to dominate American legaland Constitutional development until well into the 20th century.andM;The issue, put simply, was the extent to which &quot;ownership&quot; of &quot;property&quot;would be deemed to bestow &quot;rights&quot; that would overshadow all other interests.andO;As we'll see, this controversy, although dormant in recent years, is notdead.andM;But for now we must return to the past.andP;  It's helpful to keep in mind thefact that during much of the 19th century, the federal judiciary did notenjoy the esteem it has in our time.andP;  This was a period of unparalleledcorruption in American society, when judgeships were openly exchanged formoney or favors.andP;  While faint echos of this linger today--a prominent sittingSupreme Court justice owes his appointment in part to his yeoman-like work insecuring a crucial bloc of convention delegates for John Kennedy in 1960, forexample--nominations to the federal bench now receive close scrutiny, asevents have demonstrated on several occasions over the past twenty years.andM;By whatever means they achieved their positions, federal judges of the latterhalf of the 19th century overwhelmingly shared one attribute: even by thestandards of the day, they were staunch economic conservatives.andP;  Such was thejudicial buzzsaw that awaited the agrarian radicals' railroad legislation, aswell as most other attempts by the states--and by the Congress--to rein inthe abuses of unrestrained laissez-faire capitalism.andM;The judges ranged widely through the Constitution in their search for reasonsto invalidate laws that offended them.andP;  State regulation of railroads wasthrown out in 1886 on the grounds that it was a burden on interstatecommerce, which under the Constitution could only be subject to Congressionallegislation.andP;  But when Congress brought the Interstate Commerce Commissioninto existence the next year, the Supreme Court proceeded methodically tostrip it of most of its powers, resorting to first one rationale, thenanother.andP;  Similarly, the Court initially pulled the teeth from the Shermananti-trust act by concluding that manufacturing was not &quot;commerce&quot;, so thatthe Constitution's grant of authority over interstate commerce did not giveCongress authority to regulate it.andM;Nearly all of these rationales utilized by the courts are dead letters today,of course.andP;  But one central concept that was relied upon extensively toinvalidate laws retains its vitality, and to this we'll now turn.andM;Most people are aware that the Constitution prohibits the government fromdepriving persons of &quot;life, liberty, or property&quot; without due process of law.andO;In our time this has come to be thought of primarily in connection withcriminal cases as a protection that requires the government to provide anaccused person with a reasonable opportunity to be heard, along with a fairhearing and an impartial decision.andP;  This is what is known in the law asprocedural due process.andM;Near the middle of the last century, however, judges began to place emphasison the &quot;property&quot; portion of this Constitutional language.andP;  Theirinterpretation was linked to the idea that there were certain &quot;vestedrights&quot;, among them the right to own and enjoy property without interferencefrom arbitrary or confiscatory laws.andP;  One of the earliest references to thisapplication of due process of law was made by Chief Justice Taney in thefamous Dred Scott case, where it was used to frustrate efforts in Congress toprevent the expansion of slavery into the territories.andM;This doctrine came to be known as substantive due process, and in the 1870sthe Supreme Court began to apply it to strike down a wide spectrum of lawsgoverning business activity.andP;  Railroad rate regulation was of course a primetarget.andP;  In addition, by linking substantive due process to theConstitution's prohibition of laws &quot;impairing the Obligations of Contracts&quot;,the Court also savaged wage and hour laws, restrictions on child labor, andcurbs on &quot;yellow dog&quot; (anti-union) labor contracts.andP;  (That in these instancesthe bargaining power of the parties to the &quot;contract&quot; was grossly unequaldidn't seem to be of concern to the justices.)andM;In the 20th century the courts began a gradual retreat from their previoushostility to government interference with property rights.andP;  In 1904 theSupreme Court rejuvenated the Sherman Act by throwing out a scheme underwhich railroad magnates Hill and Harriman--theretofore fiercecompetitors--had joined forces to create a holding company that would controlboth the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern railroads.andP;  And in 1910 theCourt finally conceded to the Interstate Commerce Commission the right tocontrol the nation's railroad rate structure.andM;Still, the Court's evolution proceeded by fits and starts.andP;  The New Deallegislation of the mid-1930s was more than it was prepared to accept, andconsequently federal laws bit the dust left and right.andP;  Then, in 1937, camethe celebrated &quot;switch in time&quot;.andP;  Two members of the previous conservativemajority flatly changed sides, providing a new 5-4 majority that henceforthwould uphold the constitutionality of New Deal legislation.andM;And what of the doctrine of substantive due process?andP;  Well, that's theinteresting thing.andP;  In contrast to virtually all of the other rationales thathad been utilized by the courts to invalidate government regulation of theeconomy, substantive due process was never repudiated by the Supreme Court.andO;It was simply bypassed.andP;  The justices promulgated what was really a policyrather than a doctrine of Constitutional law, which they called &quot;judicialrestraint&quot;.andP;  In effect, they said they would refrain from using their ownsocial philosophy to second-guess the legislatures as to the wisdom of publicpolicy determinations, except in cases where the Constitution clearlyprohibited the legislative action.andM;For the time being, then, substantive due process has been relegated to thesphere of civil liberties and personal rights litigation.andP;  Will it everre-emerge as a factor in the area of economic regulation?andM;I think it might.andP;  For one thing, it's hardly news that neoconservatives havebeen exerting considerable pressure for the appointment of like-mindedindividuals to the federal bench.andP;  Moreover, three current Supreme Courtjustices are in their eighties, and that means changes in personnel areinevitable before many more years go by.andM;We've also been living through an era in which much of the government'sregulatory apparatus--the product, as we've seen, of nearly a hundred yearsof legal struggle--has been dismantled.andP;  Now we're hearing cries forre-establishment of at least a portion of it, notably from disgruntledairline customers who feel deregulation hasn't worked out the way it washoped.andP;  And there have been calls for new regulation--in this instancehitting close to home--with proposals for the licensing of computerprogrammers.andP;  The prospect of seeing one's right to practice a professiontaken away suggests a substantive due process issue, if anything would.andM;History never repeats itself exactly, of course, but the computing industrynow seems to stand at a crossroads where legal, business, and social concernsintersect--or perhaps I should say interface.andP;  At the heart of the matter isthe old controversy regarding ownership and control of &quot;property&quot;.andM;The current &quot;look and feel&quot; battle is an example that doesn't require furthercomment, and it's not the only potentially explosive issue that confronts thecomputing industry.andP;  Take the question of who &quot;owns&quot; intellectual property.andO;The Constitution puts it quite simply: Congress is empowered to secure to&quot;Authors&quot; the exclusive right to their &quot;Writings&quot;.andP;  Nothing is said aboutprotecting an &quot;owner&quot; who is not the &quot;author&quot;.andP;  Yet we know that US copyrightlaws provide for protection of a &quot;work for hire&quot;, and also permit a copyrightto be assigned.andM;Well and good, but how far should this expanded concept of ownership--asopposed to authorship--extend?andP;  Up to this point, it has come quite a ways inthe US.andP;  You own it, you can do whatever you want with it.andP;  In many othercountries this isn't quite the case.andM;Out of this controversy has grown the &quot;artistic rights&quot; movement, so calledbecause until now it has chiefly involved visual artists who object onartistic grounds to their works being altered to suit the whims or needs ofan &quot;owner&quot;.andP;  Perhaps more to the heart of the matter, though, is the factthat they're unhappy because works they've sold for relatively small sums arebeing re-sold for astronomical prices, with no recompense to them.andP;  Andthere's no reason why the principle they advocate, if adopted, shouldn'tapply to other types of intellectual property as well.andP;  Will softwaredevelopers ultimately be allowed to have a say in what's done with programsthey've created as works for hire?andM;That control and ownership of intellectual creations can, under certaincircumstances, be severable was demonstrated recently by cable mogul TedTurner's backing off from his decision to &quot;colorize&quot; Citizen Kane.andP;  He &quot;owns&quot;the film--although he had nothing whatsoever to do with creating it--but hasreluctantly concluded that he must abide by the provisions of Orson Welles'original contract with RKO.andP;  That 50-year-old document, it seems, dictatesthat the film be shown in black and white.andP;  Sanctity of contract was of greatconcern to the judges who championed substantive due process, of course, andcontracts can cut both ways.andM;Could it be time to drag out the old law books?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
