Using more than 17 million barrels a day, theU.S. is the world's biggest consumer of oil, while SaudiArabia is the largest exporter.   U.S. imports of Saudi oil declined from an average ofslightly less than 1.4 million barrels a day in 1979 to amere 188,000 barrels a day in 1985. Since then, however, U.S.imports of Saudi oil have surged, totaling 1.9 millionbarrels a day this past January.   Mr. Nazer cited a U.S. Energy Information Agency forecastthat by the year 2000 almost 57% of the oil consumed in thiscountry will be imported. He said the most likely source ofthat oil will be Middle Eastern countries, particularly SaudiArabia.   Such forecasts underscore the &quot;inescapable linkage,&quot; Mr.Nazer said. &quot;Simple economics shows a mutually beneficialdependence here,&quot; he added.   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August brought a cutoff of4.6 million barrels a day of oil production, Mr. Nazer noted.That led to some volatility in oil markets, particularly infutures trading, where prices of crude, now $20 to $21 abarrel, briefly exceeded $40 a barrel.   &quot;Price volatility under such conditions of uncertainty andperceived threat to supply can probably never be avoided,&quot;Mr. Nazer maintained. But, he added, &quot;through cooperationamong everyone with a stake in stable oil markets, widemarket-price swings based on speculation can be damped andtheir duration limited.&quot;   As a result of a &quot;restructured and efficient oilindustry,&quot; however, Saudi Arabia &quot;measured up to its words&quot;in its pledge to help offset the lost output after thePersian Gulf crisis began, Mr. Nazer said. He said thekingdom was producing about 5.5 million barrels a day butincreased production till it reached almost 8.5 millionbarrels a day in December. &quot;Other producers also helped, butwithout our rapid increase in production, the oil marketwould have gone haywire, with irreparable impact on bothindustrialized and developing countries,&quot; he said.   In his talk, the Saudi oil minister restated that aprimary goal of the kingdom's oil policy is long-term marketstability. &quot;As owners of at least a quarter of the world'soil reserves, we have to take the long-term view, for SaudiArabia will be producing oil&quot; when many other fields havegone dry, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
