Leucadia, a New York finance and insurance company, said the $26 million tender offer means it won't proceed with a previous agreement to transfer a life insurance unit, Charter National Life Insurance Co. of St. Louis, to PHLCorp in exchange for some new PHLCorp shares.    The earlier accord would have given Leucadia an 81% stake in PHLCorp, the former Baldwin-United Corp., which has holdings in the trading stamp and insurance businesses.    PHLCorp shares closed at $4.625, up $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
