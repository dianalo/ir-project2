First RepublicBank, weakened by a run on deposits andmultimillion-dollar losses, received a $1 billion injection ofcapital from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last week.   But because it could take as much as $5 billion to rescue thenation's 13th-largest bank holding company, banking regulators areconsidering breaking up the holding company as a marketingalternative.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said, ``that certainly is anoption.''   The holding company's banks in major markets could be packagedtogether or in regional or in statewide combinations, experts said.   ``The first thing you think of is splitting the company intobite-size morsels,'' said James Sexton, a former director ofsupervision at the FDIC who is a consultant at Bracewell andamp;Patterson, an Austin, Texas law firm.   ``It's a very large bank for someone else to acquire,'' saidTanya Azarchs, a banking analyst with Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. inNew York. ``I don't see anyone on the scene that's willing to dothat.''   First Republic reported a 1987 loss of $656.8 million, $3.92billion in problem assets and had deposit outflows of more than $2billion this year. Assets total about $33.2 billion.   The bank holding company, however, is in the process ofconsolidating some of its banks, which could make a breakup moredifficult. Those moves already have cut the number of banks from103 to 73, and plans are to continue mergings until only 40 remain.   The holding company has banks in Dallas, Austin, Houston and SanAntonio.   Although the breakup of the holding company could make it moreaccessible to investors, some argue it would be better if thecompany remained intact.   ``These banks are intertwined, having common management,borrowers and computer systems,'' Sexton said. ``Breaking offchunks presents some tough administrative problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
