And just as brown bags have replaced expenseaccount lunches in the '90s, that old sweater may be back instyle.   Typically, clubs are groups of 10 or 15 people whocontribute a set amount each month and then decide where toinvest it. The basic philosophy: long-term investing, with anemphasis on growth stocks, dividend reinvestment and goodsolid research.</LP><TEXT>   That may sound stodgy to investors who lived through thego-go '80s, but over time the clubs' slow-and-steady approachoften seems to pay off. For the year through April, nearly62% of the clubs in a sample studied by the NationalAssociation of Investment Clubs had lifetime annual returnsthat equaled or exceeded Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index.   &quot;There aren't many mutual funds that do better than that,&quot;says Thomas E. O'Hara., chairman of NAIC, the Royal Oak,Mich., organization of the nation's more than 7,200investment clubs.   Inquiries from people wanting information about joining orforming a club were up 95% in April over a year earlier, Mr.O'Hara says, and attendance at regional NAIC investors fairswas up 33% this year. &quot;We have seen the growth,&quot; he says.   Not only that, but membership is changing. The number ofwomen's clubs is on the rise. And while gray heads stillpredominate, the under-40 crowd now makes up 30% of themembership, instead of the traditional 20%.   &quot;They are getting younger, I think,&quot; says Peggy Schmeltz,president of the 120-unit Northwest Buckeye Council ofInvestment Clubs in Ohio. She says she's even gettingrequests for information from high school students. Thereasons: the realization that stocks perform well over timeand a fascination with computers, which are being used moreand more for investing.   Research is the nuts and bolts of club operations. It'sdone by club members and presented at the monthly meetings.Members sift through corporate documents such as annualreports to calculate price-earnings ratios, project earningsand estimate five-year potential. NAIC even provides formswith detailed instructions on how to make such calculations.   &quot;The forms NAIC provides are to make people look at thenumbers, not the hype,&quot; says Norm Pittenger, president of theChicago Council of NAIC. As an example, he points to Wal-MartStores Inc., the current darling of many analysts, but astock which he calls &quot;overvalued.&quot;   Not all clubs do well. Most, in fact, lose money in theirfirst two years, in part because they have to cover the costof commissions. And even after two years, some clubs haveless than impressive returns. For example, the Stock Baronsin Chicago, a four-year-old club, has about a 5% annualizedreturn, says member Mr. Pittenger, noting that the club hitseveral big bumps in the market -- including the 1987 marketcrash.   Also, with monthly contributions ranging from $10 to $100,even people in successful clubs don't get rich from them.   What many do, however, is use what they learn in the clubsto manage their own portfolios, and those can be sizable.While club members have an average of $3,500 in theirinvestment clubs, their personal investment accounts average$119,000.   Taking the lead from her investment club, for example,Mrs. Schmeltz recently began thinning growth stocks with highPE ratios from her portfolio. &quot;Those could really suffer&quot; ifthe market turned down, she said. Both she and her club areturning their attention to blue chip stocks.   Investment clubs come in all varieties. In Quincy, Mass.,Jack Keleher, a machine mechanic, put together a 14-memberfamily investment club made up of his wife, children,sisters, nieces and nephews. Out-of-town members vote byphone. The youngest member, Mr. Keleher's 10-year-olddaughter, Kathleen, gets her $10-a-month contribution fromher allowance and does her stock research with her dad on thecomputer.   Some clubs form at work, others are more social. A groupof Fair Lawn, N.J., parents created their club in October1989, having discussed it at the town pool over the summer.Its first stock purchases were Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc., McDonald'sCorp. and Walt Disney Co. Last year the club saw a 22%return.   Getting a club started is often the biggest problem, eventhough NAIC has a handbook that lays the process out step bystep. Members still have to thrash out the basics -- how muchwill each member contribute, how will research be assigned,how will meetings be structured, who handles the money andhow will decisions be made.   Typically, clubs are partnerships with the taxes on clubgains paid by the individuals. A bookkeeping system devisedby NAIC makes it possible for club members to vary the amountof their monthly deposits and to withdraw money from the clubif needed.   New clubs may have a hard time keeping enthusiasm up inthe early months. Orchard Investors, a club formed byemployees, suppliers and contractors at Portland CementAssociation in Skokie, Ill., has two stocks in its portfolio.One is up, and the other is down. But some members thoughtthey were going to see big returns fast for their $20 amonth, says member Dale McFarlane. Realizing that clubinvesting takes time has damped their initial enthusiasm.   In contrast, the Take Stock Investment Club in BowlingGreen, Ohio, asked members to put in $300 each when the clubstarted in September 1988. &quot;That way we had a good initialamount,&quot; explained member Janet Bower. &quot;The interest comeswhen you buy the stock.&quot; The club is now up about 50% fromwhere it started, and has a portfolio of 12 stocks.   Even when clubs are making money, though, there just isn'ta lot of sizzle to investing the NAIC way. &quot;If you do itright, it is really pretty boring,&quot; says Ernie Felzani,president of NAIC's New England Council.   Still, that's okay with him -- and many happy clubmembers. The investment, he says, &quot;continues to reproduce andreproduce, and you are really just sitting on the sidelines.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
