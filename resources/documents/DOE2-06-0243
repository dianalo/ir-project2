It is easilyunderstandable that after the accident in Chernobyl, many people feltuncomfortable and the demand for other sorts of energy, especially renewableenergy sources, increased. In the meantime, everybody returned to a morerealistic way of looking at things. The importance of nuclear energyto energy supply is still big and the elimination of nuclear energy wouldunevitably lead to price rises, even maybe endanger the supply to a certainpoint. One third of the power generated cannot be substituted on shortterm without problems. Where is nuclear energy in 1988, worldwide andin Germany and how can these aspects referred to in the public discussionabout energy be assessed? The experts' meeting made the attempt to findan answer to these questions. The topics are directed to all energy engineersand experts, and particularly to those who are not directly active innuclear techniques. All papers are separately indexed into the database.</TEXT></DOC>
