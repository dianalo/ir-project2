Three of the systemsare categorized as new submetering technologies and the fourth uses conventionalelectromechanical metering. The new types of systems are: (1) Electronicmetering using carrier wave technology for communications; (2) Electronicmetering using dedicated wiring for communication; and (3) Hybrid metering,combining an electromechanical-type communications system. The new systemswere evaluated for performance and reliability and all of the systemswere evaluated for economics.</TEXT></DOC>
