Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   Richards Medical Co., a subsidiary of London-based Smith andamp; Nephew Group PLC, said it expects to sign a pact with a Siberian hospital to manufacture a Soviet orthopedic device in the U.S.    Memphis, Tenn.-based Richards said the 10-year agreement is scheduled to be signed Thursday by officials of the company and Gavril A. Ilizarov, a Siberian surgeon.    The device, known as an external fixator, will enable orthopedists to lengthen bones, reshape deformed bones and cure certain bone infections. The procedure developed by Dr. Ilizarov, Richards said, also makes it possible to add height to dwarfs and repair badly fractured bones.    A spokesman for Richards said neither the procedure nor manufacture of the device has to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.    The technique that Dr. Ilizarov will teach to bone surgeons involves a shallow circular cut of the bone, leaving intact the bone marrow and blood supply to nourish the new bone. An external device is then installed, with thin wires running through the bone, above and below the cut. The wires are attached to metal rings that encircle the limb.    The patient wearing the device then turns a knob to tighten the device. Each turn pulls the cut ends of the bone apart by a fraction of an inch. A combination of pressure and distraction keeps the bone growing.    Richards has distributed Dr. Ilizarov's equipment in the U.S. since April 1987. Under the terms of the agreement with the Soviet Union, the company will soon begin manufacturing the device here. Used only experimentally now, the device is expected to gain more widespread use in the U.S. and Canada in the next few years. Half the profits from the venture will be kept by Richards. </TEXT></DOC>
