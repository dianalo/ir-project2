Michael L. Ainslie, president of the auction and real estate company, said the buying fever is continuing this year. This Thursday and Friday, for instance, Sotheby's will auction in Geneva, Switzerland, the jewels of the late Duchess of Windsor, and an expected crowd of 1,300 may pay $15 million or more for them.    Some of the art that came flooding into auction last year was the result of changes in the capital-gains tax laws in the U.S., Sotheby's said, including a Rembrandt painting that fetched $10.3 million here. &quot;But the high prices of 1986 auctions are bringing more good art out onto the market this year,&quot; Mr. Ainslie said.    Indeed, the art market reached such a fever pitch last fall that some experts wondered if it wouldn't become overheated and begin declining. But Mr. Ainslie said, &quot;Our feeling is that the breadth of this market is very different from past periods of strong prices. There are far more bidders out there than in the past and in a broad range of collecting areas, so it is less fragile.&quot;    Mr. Ainslie said Sotheby's believes its market share continues to rise, although arch-rival auctioneer Christie's International PLC hasn't formally released its auction results for 1986. &quot;We think Sotheby's market share is now 62%, up from 58% a year ago,&quot; Mr. Ainslie said.    He said he believes that one way Sotheby's has attracted business is its willingness to make loans against art, a practice that Christie's doesn't follow. &quot;Since we started making (the lending service) widely available two years ago, our portfolio of loans is well above $30 million,&quot; Mr. Ainslie said. He added that the lending practices are &quot;very conservative&quot; and that Sotheby's hasn't had any loan losses.    Most of the loans are made to art collectors as an advance against a later sale at Sotheby's, Mr. Ainslie said, but &quot;increasingly we are making loans against permanent collections which aren't going to be sold. It helps people get liquidity from their art, without having to sell it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
