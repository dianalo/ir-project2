Prisoners who complete terms can't get out of jail. Bodies stackup in the morgue waiting for autopsies. Mail piles up undeliveredin post offices. Taxes are uncollected. Hospital patients must waitfor treatment.   ``The crisis in the public sector is an expression of theeconomic chaos that exists in the country,'' said Carlos Morales,an independent labor analyst.   Hundreds of thousands of government workers have walked offtheir jobs to demand gargantuan pay raises to offset the loss inthe purchasing power of their salaries caused by Peru'shyperinflation, running at nearly 3,000 percent annually.   Not wanting to fuel inflation, the government has resisted theworkers' demands, approving wage increases that fall short of theinflation rate.   A mountain of 5 million letters sits in Lima's central postoffice waiting to be sorted and delivered as postal workers walkthe picket lines.   A walkout by workers at the National Tax Administration officehas reduced tax collections by 70 percent.   A strike by prison workers has delayed paperwork authorizing therelease of prisoners who have served out their terms. The directorof Peru's department of prisons, Wilder Vidal, said recently thatmore than 900 convicts whose sentences have lapsed remain behindbars.   Teachers, bus drivers, water and sewer workers and gravediggersare all on strike.   Even prostitutes from the nearby port of Callao took to thestreets recently to demand a reduction in the 50 percent tax theyare required to pay to a city government starved for revenue tomeet escalating costs.   A sign in the emergency room at Casimiro Ulloa hospital asks the``understanding of patients and injured'' who cannot be attendedbecause of a strike by hospital workers, including doctors.   The strike in public hospitals has had grave consequences forthe poor, who cannot afford private clinics.   Josefina Quispe said she tried to take her father, a streetvendor, to a state hospital when he complained of kidney pains,apparently caused by complications from a kidney operation monthsearlier.   ``A doctor told me to take him home to die,'' Ms. Quispe said.   Her father died at home, without medical attention.   The common denominator in all the strikes, some of which haveresulted in bloody street clashes with riot police, is a demand forhigher pay to help workers deal with the inflation.   ``On average, government salaries have 15 percent of thepurchasing power they had in 1973, and 35 percent of what they hadbefore September 1988,'' the magazine Analisis Laboral saidrecently.   The average monthly salary for public employees is 753,012 intis_ $50. Government studies say the minimum income a family of fiveneeds to buy basic necessities is the equivalent of $213, or 10times the minimum wage of $21.   The economic crisis also has provoked the most dramatic fall inthe gross national product in Peru's history. The economy hasshrunk by 14 percent so far this year, following a 9 percent dropin 1988.   With public services paralyzed, some entrepreneurs have beenquick to see an opportunity in the chaos. They have created privateventures to offer alternatives to public services.   At least six private mail services have started up, someoffering guaranteed, four-day delivery to the United States atprices ranging from $1.50 to $7 a letter.   ``It's very simple,'' said a worker at Giant Express, one of thenew mail services. ``So we don't have to charge as much asdoor-to-door courier services, we take the letters and send them toMiami with an airline, and from there we send them on by regularmail.''   The company also brings mail into the country, a service manyhave used since the U.S. postal service stopped delivering to Peruin October because of the strike, which began Sept. 14.   ``Business is booming, and we have increased our deliveriestenfold,'' said the Giant Express worker.   Morales, the labor analyst, predicted the strikes will continueas long as the country's economic slide goes unchecked. He andothers blame a bloated bureaucracy for much of the economictroubles.   They say the excessive number of bureaucrats, numbering morethan 1 million in a nation of 21 million people, are anunproductive drain on the government.   One who shares that view is the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, thefront-running candidate for the presidency in April's election.Vargas Llosa is running on a platform of free-work economicpolicies. He is pledging to reduce the government bureaucracy and``shift'' thousands of state workers to the private sector.   President Alan Garcia, a populist ineligible for re-election,has tried to maintain the little political support he still enjoysby accusing Vargas Llosa of planning to fire half a millionworkers, a charge the candidate denies.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 24</NOTE></DOC>
