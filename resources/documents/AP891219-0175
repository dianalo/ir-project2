(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 24-Hour Church of Elvis is here,sharing space with ``the world's cheapest psychic'' and a machinedispensing an eclectic collection of tacky prizes at a quarter apop.   Put a quarter in the slot and a computer-generated voice greetsyou:   ``Hello, welcome to Where's the Art!!, the world's first 24-hourcoin-operated art gallery. What would you like?''   Art?   Stuffed into three storefront windows in downtown Portland,Where's the Art!! is a repository of spinning, talking and singingartifacts from American pop culture. Glitter, garland andfluorescent colors abound.   There are the Elvis Presley shrine and the ``Amazing NewSee-Through Prize-o-Matic Dispenser,'' dispensing little gag prizesof obscure value.   ``I like to kind of shock people a little bit,'' saysowner-inventor Stephanie Pierce.   That helps explain why her certificate of admission to the NewYork Bar hangs above her toilet.   Pierce graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 1980and worked as a corporate lawyer for American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo. in New York for three years.   ``People think they can dismiss me as a lunatic, a member of thefar-out fringe, but then they are really so impressed by the factthat I went to law school,'' Pierce says.   Working on legal accounting issues just wasn't for her.   After she handed in her letter of resignation, she says, herboss, George Finkelstein, said, ``Stephanie, I'll see you ... onthe sidewalk begging for quarters. Good luck.''   Finkelstein was on target. Pierce often drums up business on thesidewalk outside her store. She cajoles people who look but don'tdrop quarters in the slots.   When the quarter plinks into one of the coin slots, the computertalks.   You can choose psychic counseling from ``Dr. Justin D.Nikov-Time,'' sacraments in the Church of Elvis, fun with the KidWindow, or a parody of the game show ``Let's Make a Deal.''   All sorts of people come by this sidewalk arcade: collegestudents, tourists, street people, businessmen on lunch breaks.Some just look. Others stop and put in quarters. They all laugh.   ``That's one of the things I like the best _ making peoplelaugh,'' she says.   Talk about participatory art. The gallery ``marries'' couples inthe Church of Elvis, replete with plastic rings and Elvis singing``Love Me Tender.'' It conducts question-and-answer sessions withthe ``psychic counselor,'' and pushes people to ``dance with thestars'' right there on the pavement.   Doing a past-life regression, the computer psychic might say,``You were a fish, you were a bird, you were Shirley MacLaine, youwere Shirley MacLaine, you were Shirley MacLaine, you were ShirleyMacLaine.''   After answering all the questions by pushing colored buttons,the ``patient'' receives a prize: perhaps a 3-D Psychic Calendar,or the Handy Horoscope, which might include a prediction of animpending restaurant deal with Reggie Jackson. Pierce makes most ofthe prizes herself.   Living in one window are a male mannequin with apaint-by-numbers picture of a raccoon, and a female mannequinwearing a sign that says ``Don't Hate Me Because I'm Beautiful.''Attached to her bizarre helmet is a vacuum hose that runs up from acontraption called the ``Bowling Channel Brain Stimulator.''   This is art, Pierce says, not what's found in traditionalgalleries. ``That's why I call it `Where's the Art!!' It's not aquestion, it's a demand,'' she says.   Pierce, 38, now revels in her place outside the artestablishment. But she did apply, three times, to Cooper Union forthe Advancement of Science and Art in New York. The art samples shesubmitted included sketches of a ``Dreaminator,'' a machine thatwould allow people to record their dreams and play them back.   Pierce was rejected, but she says that's all right because notgoing to art school kept her on her own track.   ``I used to hide my strangeness all the time,'' Pierce says.``It was really a struggle. I was trying so hard to be normal. NowI feel like I'm myself.''   Pierce traded in her business suits for leopard-print pants,shorts, tie-dye shirts, and wild hair.   She is host of a public access cable television show, also named``Where's the Art!!'' The program, which she calls a show-and-tellfor artists and musicians, is open to anyone, and just aboutanything.   She has been making unusual pieces since childhood. She and herbrother and sister made little ``machines,'' including one that wasan early version of her current prize dispenser.   Pierce says she made $42,000 a year as a lawyer, and piled upthe tips as a waitress. Now she struggles to keep her store afloat.Her financial situation has improved dramatically since she beganselling ``Where's the Art!!'' T-shirts. Until then, she was fivemonths behind on the rent.   Business may improve further when Pierce expands to mail-orderdelivery of the T-shirts and possibly some of the prizes.   She says she makes about $600 a month in quarters. She has toput up with frequent leaks in her store, and duns for herdelinquent student loan payments.   Pierce works 12 to 15 hours a day. ``But it doesn't feel likework,'' she says. ``I'm my own boss. I don't make much money but itdoesn't matter. It's a lifestyle.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
