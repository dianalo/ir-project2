In the Congress today, a few senators have chosen to play their own games with U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, demanding that President Reagan invoke the War Powers Resolution of 1973 so that U.S. troops will have to leave the Gulf within 60 days unless Congress says otherwise. Perhaps Hollywood should get ready for a sequel.    How else are we to characterize last week's spectacle of 100 senators playing Bismarck-for-a-day by debating &quot;war powers,&quot; and, just for good measure, attaching 86 separate amendments to a State Department funding bill? The senators were no doubt sincere in asserting congressional power, but in the process they merely proved how incapable Congress is of planning or implementing any kind of coherent national security policy. While U.S. helicopter pilots were bravely defending themselves against Iranian patrol boats in the Gulf, the Senate's idea of support was to debate whether to limit the flexibility of the commander in chief in helping those pilots succeed.    Now, it's true that the senators who want to invoke the War Powers Act claim they only want the Congress, as the voice of the people, to have a say in Gulf policy. &quot;If we're going to get into a protracted war in the Middle East, why not let the American people say where we are going?&quot; said Senator Patrick Leahy.    Note well, however, that Senator Leahy and friends have not leapt to propose any policy of their own. Instead, they're engaged only in obstructing the policy of a sitting president, who also happens to have been chosen by the people. The congressional leadership prefers, as usual, to evade the substantive issue and fall back on a procedural diversion like war powers.    If President Reagan did invoke the act, of course, Congress wouldn't ever have to vote on the issue. Under the law's legislative veto, the troops would simply have to come home within 60 days, unless Congress took the affirmative step of voting that they could stay -- an unlikely display of responsibility. The brave senators could both embarrass President Reagan and force the U.S. to cut and run from the Gulf, without ever declaring themselves on the record.    We've had our own doubts about the strategic implications of the administration's Gulf policy, but now that the U.S. has committed its forces and prestige it makes no sense to cut and run. Indeed, the U.S. has slowly succeeded in making the Gulf patrol much less of a U.S.-only effort. Just last week West Germany said it's going to play a role in protecting Gulf shipping, joining France and Great Britain, among others. What this amounts to now is something close to an out-of-area NATO operation. In quieter ways, too, moderate Arab states have lent their support.    A decision to pull back now would signal that chipping in to help the U.S. in this way isn't worth the price. No doubt U.S. allies would also savor the irony that the American politicians who lambaste them for not &quot;burden sharing&quot; are the same ones who order the U.S. to run for cover once the allies do begin to help. Invoking the act would also be an invitation to Iran, or terrorists of any sort, to strike U.S. forces quickly to create more sympathy in Congress for bringing the boys home in 60 days. Remember Beirut?    No country, and certainly not one that wants to remain a great power, can afford to have its foreign policy made hostage to a 60-day calendar. That's one reason the Founders gave the powers of commander in chief to the executive, while congressional authority in foreign policy was limited to a few specific duties (such as the power of the purse). As President Reagan noted in an interview broadcast over the weekend, Congress has declared war only five times in U.S. history, yet presidents have used American military forces some 200 times.    Senator Weicker says the War Powers Act must be obeyed in any case because it's on the books; he could always join House colleagues who've sued to enforce the act. While such suits are of dubious standing, we have to agree that a test of the law would be a good thing. As President Reagan said, &quot;We think it's illegal.&quot;    The current debate over the Gulf again shows a Congress trying to claim power while evading responsibility; this is why the Supreme Court has already ruled against the legislative veto in other bills. Congress could pass the War Powers Act only over President Nixon's veto, and no president has ever recognized its strictures. In any fair hearing it would almost surely be found unconstitutional. </TEXT></DOC>
