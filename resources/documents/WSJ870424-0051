Worries about the falling dollar, sharply rising commodity prices and an avalanche of Treasury borrowing coming soon continue to weigh heavily on the markets. During the past four weeks alone, prices of actively traded Treasury bonds have fallen more than 10%, hitting their lowest levels since February 1986.    The latest 30-year Treasury bond now yields slightly more than 8 1/2%, an increase of about one percentage point since March 26. Corporate and municipal bond yields also have surged in the largest, swiftest bond market collapse since early 1984.    Prices of some corporate and municipal bonds fell more than 1/2 point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Treasury bonds also retreated again in volatile trading. The latest 30-year Treasury bond fell about 1/4 point. In early trading Friday in the Tokyo markets, the issue dropped another 3/8 point.    &quot;All the news seems to be bearish. There aren't many people with the nerve to go against the wind and buy bonds right now,&quot; said Alan G. Bozian, a first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland. Pointing to recent increases in prices of gold, silver and other commodities, he said, &quot;Everything has a bearish, inflationary slant to it.&quot;    The dollar's precipitous drop in the foreign-exchange markets has aroused intense fears that foreign investors will shun U.S. government bonds. The dollar fell again yesterday, heightening those worries, especially as the Treasury is planning to sell $28 billion or $29 billion of new notes and bonds soon. Details of the government's note and bond sales will be announced Wednesday.    &quot;Right now, Japanese investors aren't buying, and I don't think they will buy many bonds until they see a bottom to the dollar,&quot; said Kenneth M. deRegt, a managing director at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Some analysts contend that the dollar won't stabilize until the Federal Reserve acts to raise interest rates further here and until Japan's central bank lowers its rates. Although higher rates would probably cut into U.S. economic growth, the Fed may have no other choice if the dollar goes into another tailspin.    &quot;Uncertainty over the possibility of a discount rate increase by the Fed is a big factor&quot; in the credit markets, Mr. deRegt said. The discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, now stands at 5 1/2%.    A discount rate increase would be an unusually bold step for the Fed to take, especially in view of continued concern about the economic outlook, many analysts said. &quot;A discount rate increase is much too dramatic a move to make anytime soon,&quot; said Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. &quot;The market is much more fearful on this subject than is warranted.&quot;    But it may take just such a bold move to restore the dollar's strength, some analysts reply. Speculation has grown recently that Fed officials are talking privately with Bank of Japan officials in an effort to put together a package that would consist of a credit-tightening move here and lower rates in Japan.    The Fed already may be tightening its credit grip slightly in an effort to bolster the dollar and underscore its determination to combat inflation, according to some economists. As evidence, they point to recent increases in the closely watched federal funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend one another overnight.    The funds rate, which averaged slightly more than 6% earlier this year, averaged 6.44% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The rate averaged about 6 1/4% in the week ended Wednesday after averaging 6.41% the previous week.    &quot;There has been a very fundamental change in the outlook for interest rates and inflation,&quot; said James R. Solloway, vice president and director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. He contended that the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds is likely to hover in an 8% to 9% band for the next few months. From last spring until March of this year, long-term Treasury bond yields ranged between about 7 1/8% and 8%.    &quot;I think the Fed has tightened (credit conditions) slightly,&quot; said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Mr. Stone of Merrill Lynch agreed, saying: &quot;I think the Fed has become a little less generous in providing reserves&quot; to the banking system.    Banking statistics released yesterday afternoon by the Fed surprised many analysts. The Fed reported an exceptionally large increase in its loans to banks and savings institutions. Borrowings from the Fed averaged $935 million in the week ended Wednesday and $443 million the previous week, for an average of $689 million in the two-week period. That was an increase from $393 million in the previous two-week period.    Mrs. Ramirez said the huge increase in borrowings during the latest week was an &quot;aberration&quot; caused by technical factors draining reserves temporarily from the banking system. Nevertheless, she said the Fed lately appears to have adopted a &quot;slightly less generous monetary policy&quot; in an effort &quot;to prevent a further decline in the dollar.&quot;    In addition to concern about whether the Fed is changing its credit policy, many market participants are worried about whether the Fed's leadership will change, too. Rumors that Fed Chairman Paul Volcker is about to resign have swept the markets despite several denials by a Fed spokesman.    &quot;Rightly or wrongly, anybody the administration appoints to replace Volcker will be viewed as a person who is willing to pursue an easier monetary policy than is appropriate,&quot; Mr. Solloway said. &quot;That may not be true, but that would be the general perception.&quot;    Mr. Volcker still commands enormous respect both in the U.S. and abroad. In a recent survey of 512 institutional investment decision makers, Mr. Volcker was by far the top choice for the Fed chairmanship.    According to the survey, taken by Richard B. Hoey of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., 87.9% of those polled said they prefer Mr. Volcker to any of the others rumored for the job. The survey also showed 55.7% of the investment decision makers believe the odds of double-digit inflation would increase if Mr. Volcker were replaced.    If Mr. Volcker were replaced, the two most preferred replacements, according to the poll, are E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Alan Greenspan, a New York economic consultant. However, Treasury Secretary James Baker now is regarded as the most likely replacement for Mr. Volcker, according to the Hoey poll.    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 wound up at 89 3/32 to yield 8.51%. Wednesday, the issue finished at 89 10/32, where the yield was 8.49%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 fell to 93 from 93 6/32, as the yield rose to 8.32% from 8.3%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. fell 2.34 points to close at 1298.50. It ranged between 1291.29 and 1311.35.    Many analysts were surprised by a Commerce Department report early yesterday showing the economy expanded at a 4.3% annual rate in the first quarter, after adjusting for inflation. That followed an anemic 1.1% rate in last year's fourth quarter.    Although the increase was considerably larger than the roughly 3% rise that most forecasters had expected, many quickly contended that the report exaggerated the economy's strength. They noted that the gains largely reflected a buildup of inventories, and that consumer spending fell.    &quot;This was more a sign of weakness than of strength,&quot; said Mr. Solloway of Argus. He promptly lowered his second-quarter economic growth estimate to &quot;3% or a bit less&quot; from his earlier forecast of a 3.5% rate.    Short-term interest rates were mixed. The latest three-month Treasury bill rate rose slightly to 5.48% bid from 5.43% on Wednesday, while the latest six-month Treasury bill rate fell to 5.8% bid from 5.92%.    The Fed said that the nation's basic money supply, known as M1, surged $2.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted average of $742.1 billion in the week ended April 13. The M1 measure, which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public, averaged $737.6 billion in the latest 13 weeks, which represents a 9.2% annual growth rate from the like period 13 weeks earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
