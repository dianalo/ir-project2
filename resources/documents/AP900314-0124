That's what happened Tuesday when no one showed up for theRepublican primary in this west Texas town, population 60.   But election officials at Precinct 34 in southwest Taylor Countyweren't really surprised. Only one person voted in the previousprimaries.   Shep's only Republican voter developed cancer and was sent to ahospital in Houston, said county GOP chairman Brent Casey.   The man had been the only GOP voter in primaries in 1986 and1988.   Before 1986, there wasn't even a voting place for Republicans inShep, 250 miles west of Dallas. Republicans had to vote in anotherprecinct.   Officials opened the Republican polling place Tuesday hoping toattract other voters, who were allowed to decide at the last minutewhether to vote in the Democratic or Republican gubernatorialprimary.   ``We had really hoped that Clayton Williams might draw somepeople out there because it is a farming community,'' said Casey'smother, Betty, the precinct's election judge. Williams won the GOPgubernatorial nomination and is a rancher.   ``But it is difficult for people who have been Democratic foryears and years to have Republican stamped on their voterregistration.''   It was a long, boring day for the election judges as they waitedfor voters who never appeared.   ``We did a lot of reading,'' Mrs. Casey said.</TEXT></DOC>
