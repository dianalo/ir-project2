 Arthur Andersen's A-plusTax is the onlyprogram developed by a major national accounting firm that is also availablefor sale to the public.andP;  The Lacerte Individual Tax Program is one of thehalf-dozen most widely used professional programs, and one of the mostexpensive.andM;At $1,500 for the federal Form 1040 package, A-plusTax does over 50 IRSsupporting forms and schedules and a goodly number of worksheets.andP;  On thesupporting forms, it actually does most of the subsidiary calculations,instead of simply providing a template on which to enter the results ofmanual calculations.andP;  This is intended to save the tax accountant time andmoney in the long run.andM;With laser-printer drivers priced at $500), a laser printer and a tax fontcartridge, the program prints authentic replicas of all supported IRS forms.andO;A-plusTax also handles many business housekeeping functions such as specialreports, batch input and printing, client letters, filing instructions andinvoices.andP;  Like several other packages I reviewed, A-plusTax wasn't quite outof beta testing by our publication deadline.andP;  I visited the A-plusTax peoplein their Florida laboratories to watch as the finishing touches were applied.andM;A-plusTax offers a choice of three styles of data entry, including batchentry from previously filled-out data sheets.andP;  lbs represents a noble efforton the part of Andersen's designers to adjust to a practitioner's preferredmethod.andP;  But A-plusTax has not aged well since its introduction a number ofyears ago.andP;  The software is written in a variant of BASIC, and its userinterface strikes me as a relic from the bad old days of abstruse andunnecessarily cumbersome mainframe applications.andP;  A-plusTax forces the taxpractitioner to substitute memorization and training time in place of manyefficiencies that could be written into the software and put on the screen.andO;And recalculation time is slow; a 386 machine is a virtual necessity forefficient use of A-plusTax.andM;The next rewrite is likely to be coded in a more modem programming language,and, it is hoped, will incorporate an up-to-date interface.andP;  Meanwhile, interms of the extent and depth of its forms and features, A-plusTax is a finetax-preparation program.andP;  With its agonizingly slow recalculation time andits awkward and opaque screen conventions, however, it lumbers along like agoldplated dinosaur.andM;Lacerte ($2,000 for the 1040 package) does 38 IRS forms and schedules,performs many special calculations automatically and in great detail, andturns out client filing letters and bills.andM;As with most Professional programs-including AplusTax-acerte has a batchinput mode that allows the knowledgeable tax Specialist to enter tax data byhand on input sheets.andP;  The sheets are then turned over to a data entryclerk-totally innocent of tax background-to enter into the computer.andP;  A fairamount of training of the tax professional and rote learning by the dataprocessor is necessary to get up to speed with input sheets and batchprocessing.andM;A touch of the F5 key switches the software tO its interactive mode, and hereLacerte really shines.andP;  A completely different set of screens comes up,labeled with recognizable terms and explanations.andM;A tap of Fl invokes exceptionally concise and pertinent help windows for eachline.andP;  The software doesn't just inundate you with help; instead, theinformation appears in a useable context, with explanations of what to enter.andO;You also learn where and how your answers will be used, not only at the entrypoint but also elsewhere in the program.andP;  Despite the helpful on-screendocumentation, however, it can be awkward and time consuming to keep track ofwhere all our in t is taking you.andM;Lacerte also lags when it comes to calculation time.andP;  In fact, the programneeded 2MB of hard disk space and several minutes just to calculate thefederal tax for my sample scenario.andP;  This is On top of the 4MB of hard diskspace the program eats up for storage.andP;  As with the Arthur Andersen program,the snail's pace of the calculation and printing steps comes from theprogram's being written years ago, when BASIC was the programming language ofchoice.andP;  If it ain't broke, don't fix it,&quot; I was told when talking withLacerte.andM;Lacerte is a first-rate Program in many respects, but woefully short of thespeed and efficiency that today's tax professional is entitled to expect forthe hefty price.andP;  Both Lacerte and A-plusTax lack the basic performance anduser interface innovations of personal programs costing much less.andP;  Theseprofessional packages have features accountants require, but they could bothbenefit from thorough revision.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
