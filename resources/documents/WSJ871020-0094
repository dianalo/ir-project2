For the quarter, earnings fell to $505 million, or 47 cents a share, from $533 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $8.47 billion from $8.43 billion.    Analysts said the earnings were slightly above expectations. They noted that year-earlier earnings included a gain and a charge that added a total of four cents to per-share profit, and that the latest period's earnings included a number of one-time adjustments to costs that artificially depressed results.    The relatively solid earnings report didn't buoy shares of the telecommunications giant, whose stock plunged along with most others in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. ATandamp;T fell $6.25 to close at $23.75, with 10,631,800 shares changing hands on the Big Board.    &quot;In any other market, ATandamp;T would have been up,&quot; said Robert Morris, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;As soon as we see a bottoming out here, telephone will be a cheap stock. Right now, it doesn't really matter what the numbers look like, nobody cares about buying stocks.&quot;    For the nine months, ATandamp;T's net rose 18% to $1.55 billion, or $1.42 a share, from $1.31 billion, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. Revenue, however, fell to $25 billion from $25.56 billion. Year-earlier results included a charge of $175 million, or 16 cents a share, from a change in accounting for depreciation.    Separately, ATandamp;T filed its response to a proposal by the Federal Communications Commission to replace profit regulation of ATandamp;T's long-distance business with a cap on prices charged to customers. The response, which supported the agency's proposal, immediately drew fire from some consumer groups.    ATandamp;T said it wants to set the price cap at current prices and to tie changes in the cap to changes in the Consumer Price Index. The price-cap method would last three years and then the company would be virtually deregulated. Analysts believe such a method will allow ATandamp;T eventually to boost its earnings greatly.    Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of America said his group will sue the FCC if the price-cap proposal is ultimately implemented without adequate regulation of ATandamp;T's costs and earnings. Such a price-cap method, he said, would violate the Communications Act of 1934 that requires rates of dominant carriers to be &quot;just and reasonable&quot; as determined by their costs and earnings. He also opposed ATandamp;T's proposal to tie price caps to the consumer index, because phone prices historically have risen far less than the index.    &quot;If Congress had written the ATandamp;T proposal into the Communications Act, phone rates would be more than double what they are today,&quot; Mr. Kimmelman said.    But Larry Garfinkel, an ATandamp;T vice president, said the company also proposed that the FCC monitor its profits for three years. And, he said, only a portion of the price cap would be tied to the index. The remainder would be tied to changes in ATandamp;T's costs to connect to local phone companies. In any event, he said, ATandamp;T likely would be forced to price its services below the cap because of competition. ATandamp;T also said it would prefer having no price cap or profit regulation at all, with the FCC simply monitoring ATandamp;T's prices.    In FCC filings yesterday, several regional Bells supported price-cap regulation for ATandamp;T and also sought to convince the FCC to apply the caps to them at the same time. They noted that half of ATandamp;T's costs reflect access charges paid to local phone companies for making long-distance connections. Currently, those charges are regulated under profit caps.    Floyd Keene, vice president and associate general counsel for Chicago-based Ameritech, argued that it doesn't make sense to cap ATandamp;T's prices while at the same time regulating access charges on a profit basis.    For its part, Ameritech proposed that local phone companies be allowed to choose between profit regulation and price caps. The caps would apply to a group of various access services provided by the local companies.    In the third quarter, analysts said ATandamp;T's earnings reflected strong profit from its long-distance business, which posted a 3.3% revenue gain, and strong sales of its phone switches to phone companies. Those gains were partly offset by weak sales of computer and phone equipment sold to consumers and to businesses, and by a 25% decline in rental revenue during the quarter.    At a news conference to announce an expected technology agreement with Sun Microsystems Inc., the president of ATandamp;T's Data Systems Group, Vittorio Cassoni, said sales of computers to customers outside the company in the first nine months have declined from last year, but that his goal of cutting losses to less than one-third of last year's remains on track. &quot;This year we have concentrated on reducing our cost base&quot; and on developing new products, he said.    Analysts said, however, that they thought that ATandamp;T's earnings in future quarters will continue to reflect growth in long-distance and in equipment sales to phone companies. Mr. Morris said several one-time adjustments in costs, reflecting adjustments for bad debt and taxes, among other things, depressed third quarter per-share earnings by about four or five cents.    &quot;This was a strong, solid quarter for them,&quot; said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber Inc. &quot;I still think, though, they aren't anywhere in the computer business. ATandamp;T isn't a computer company; it is a telecommunications company. But in this market, it's better being a telecommunications company than a computer company,&quot; because revenue and earnings from phone service tend to be more stable. </TEXT></DOC>
