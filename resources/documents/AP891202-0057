WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A top Communist Party official resigned todayand accused the East German leadership of being incapable ofoverseeing the political and economic reforms demanded by thepro-democracy movement.   The resignation of Central Committee Secretary Hans-JoachimWillerding was another blow to embattled party chief Egon Krenz,who has been trying to gain respect for the party as it faces achallenge to its 40-year monopoly on power.   Willerding stepped down a day after the East German public wastold how top party leaders took bribes, lived opulent lifestyles,went on luxury vacations and squirreled away billions of dollars inSwiss bank accounts.   Willerding told the official ADN news agency that he had noconfidence the leadership could gain the authority to lead thedrive for democratic change.   ``Renewal is possible only when the Communist Party leads withunity and determination,'' he said.   He called for swift action against former leaders who abusedtheir powers.   Willerding was named secretary of the powerful Central Committeeand a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo less than a monthago, after Erich Honecker's longtime government was forced toresign.   Krenz, 52, has been trying desperately to distance himself fromthe old guard, of which had been a prominent member.   Shaking their heads in disbelief and disgust, members ofParliament listened Friday to a litany of corruption involvingleaders who rigidly maintained a spartan society for their peoplewhile indulging in excess.   During a nationally televised session that ran late into Fridaynight, Krenz declared his party's guilt but sought to separate hisnew leadership from the disgraced figures now ousted from power.   Nevertheless, he took responsibility for the party's allegedmisuse of power in 40 years of uncontested rule.   ``Gross political errors have been committed by my party,''Krenz told the parliamentary session. ``As leader of the Politburoand the Central Committee, I take responsibility for this.''   The party newspaper Neues Deutschland commented today: ``This isall the more painful and incomprehensible in that these people fordecades handed out to others the bread of poverty.''   The newspaper declared the old guard Communists to be guilty of``outright grabbing and misuse of power, corruption, coverups andacts for which there can be no understanding and no forgiveness.''   Heinrich Toeplitz, head of the commission investigating abuse ofpower, told Parliament that Honecker and other ousted leaders spenthuge sums on hunting lodges, luxury homes and other indulgences.   Toeplitz confirmed that accusations against the ousted leadersdisclosed before his investigative commission suggest that 100billion marks ($54 billion) has been spirited out of the country toSwiss bank accounts.   The official news agency ADN said the full, 163-member CommunistParty Central Committee would meet Sunday to weigh necessary``consequences'' on the situation in the party. It could decide toexpel Honecker and others implicated in the corruption reports.   Toeplitz's disclosures led to demands that Foreign TradeMinister Gerhard Beil immediately explain the whereabouts of thatmoney.   ``I cannot explain this right now, and you wouldn't want me tobe able to,'' Beil contended, saying a broad investigation isneeded.   He was stopped with shouts of ``Why not?'' and accusations thathe and others held over from the former leadership were part of theproblem.   Former Politburo members Guenter Mittag and Guenther Kleiberwere singled out as having pocketed bribes and kickbacks forimported goods purchased at state expense.   Mittag already has been ousted from the party.   Krenz pledged that past mistakes will be corrected, butanti-Communist sentiment has been spreading rapidly in the nationof more than 16 million.   The city council of Plauen demanded that Krenz resign over hisalleged role in faking results of municipal elections last summerthat gave the Communists an overwhelming majority.   Krenz is facing growing challenges to his leadership from boththe opposition and his own party because of his longtimeassociation with the Honecker regime.   Krenz, Honecker's hand-picked successor, took power Oct. 18after most of the old leaders were ousted by a wave of unrest andthe exodus of hundreds of thousands of citizens to the West.   Since then, the leadership has instituted sweeping reform,including lifting travel barriers and opening the Berlin Wall.   The Communists are struggling to regain political initiativebefore the Dec. 7 start of talks with the opposition on thenation's future course. The party has also scheduled an emergencycongress for Dec. 15-17.   At Friday's Parliament session, the Communists were stripped oftheir guaranteed ``leading role'' mandated by the constitution for40 years.   The legislature also passed a resolution regretting EastGermany's decision to join in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion ofCzechoslovakia that crushed the short-lived ``Prague Spring''reform era.   The resolution offered apologies to the people of Czechoslovakiaand expressed solidarity with the process of reforms going onthere. Czechoslovakia's Prliament abolished the Communists' leadingrole Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
