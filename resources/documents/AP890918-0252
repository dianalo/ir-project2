Gold prices also fell following gains overseas. Republic NationalBank quoted gold at $360.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, vs.$362.50 late Friday.   Money traders said the foreign exchange market was quieter Mondaythan last Friday, when wild rumors and price swings jolted tradersand wrenched down the dollar's value unexpectedly.   Traders said that rout convinced other dollar holders to selltheir holdings Monday or at least avoid the market until thecurrency's long-term outlook becomes clearer.   ``The dollar bulls are hanging on the sidelines,'' said MichaelGuarino, vice president and chief dealer at the New York branch ofAlgemene Bank Nederland NV, the largest Dutch bank.``The dollarbears are taking over. They have the central banks in their favor.That's going to add fuel to the fire.''   The central banks of the United States and its principal tradingallies repeatedly have swooped into the foreign exchange marketsrecently to sell large amounts of dollars in order to keep thedollar from rising in value.   A more expensive dollar partly reflects confidence in the U.S.economy and the relatively high interest rates offered in thiscountry, which attract foreign investors. But as the dollar's valuerises, it hurts American manufacturers by making their products moreexpensive overseas.   Some traders said a meeting this weekend of finance ministersfrom the so-called Group of Seven nations likely would reinforce thegroup's resolve to keep the dollar at present levels or depress itfurther. Others said it was impossible to speculate intelligently onwhat the G-7 nations might do.   ``At this point I dare say I wouldn't put my neck on the line. Myframe of mind is one minute to one hour,'' said Scott Horwitz,senior foreign exchange trader at the Bank of Boston's New Yorkbranch. ``I think we'll see the dollar trade in a range until we getnew direction from that meeting.''   The G-7 members meeting in Washington include envoys fromBritain, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, the United States and WestGermany.
