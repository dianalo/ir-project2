The reductions brought Bank of Montreal's prime rate downto 11.5%, while other major banks reduced theirs to 11.75%.It was the fifth reduction in the prime rate, or the basecharge for much of the banks' lending, since August, whenmost major banks had a 14.75% rate.</LP><TEXT>   Lloyd Atkinson, Bank of Montreal's chief economist,predicted that the Canadian prime rate will fall at least to9.5% by the end of this year as the economy weakens. &quot;Everynumber you look at points to the recession's deepening,&quot; hesaid. Employment declined at an annual rate of 3.2% in thefourth quarter, and retail sales volume declined at an annualrate of 8% in October and November, he said.   Mr. Atkinson predicted that the current economic declinewill be Canada's second most severe recession since World WarII, exceeded only by the 1981-82 downturn.   The recession has caused a sharp drop in private-sectorborrowing that has contributed to the decline in interestrates. Preliminary data for January suggest that the slowdownin business credit demand has continued into this year, saidAron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia's senior economist.   The banks' prime rate cuts followed new declines inshort-term interest rates in the Canadian money market.Three-month Canadian government treasury bills yielded 10.57%late yesterday, down from 10.78% a week earlier. MarkChandler, Royal Bank of Canada economist, predicted thatshort-term Canadian interest rates -- already down more thanthree percentage points since last May -- will fall anotherpoint by summer.   Mr. Chandler said the Bank of Canada has allowedshort-term rates to fall because the economic downturn hasdamped inflationary pressures. &quot;All indicators of economicdemand are quite weak,&quot; he said.   Steven Kressler, bank analyst with Midland Walwyn CapitalInc., said Bank of Montreal has been able to be the mostaggressive of the major banks in reducing its prime ratebecause it is significantly more liquid than the others. Atthe end of 1990, he said, 18.8% of Bank of Montreal's assetswere in cash resources, Canadian Treasury bills and otherhighly liquid instruments, compared with an average of 10.4%at the other major banks.</TEXT></DOC>
