But many bruised investors have yet to buy in.    Rising interest rates had hammered bond funds since the spring. Depressed bond prices sliced portfolios' net asset values, and funds underwent heavy redemptions. But when stocks stumbled last month, the Federal Reserve eased credit.    That triggered a vigorous bond market rally, especially in government issues.    &quot;Bond funds had been a stepchild; suddenly they've become more attractive,&quot; Wayne Lyski, portfolio manager for Alliance Bond Fund, says.    This week, for the first time since August, bond funds monitored by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. broke into the black for the year, with the average fixed-income fund gaining 0.16% through Nov. 5.    Among the top performers in recent weeks have been U.S. government funds -- particularly those holding the longest-term securities. Longer-term Treasurys typically respond more quickly to interest-rate changes.    Before Oct. 19 became known as Black Monday, for instance, Strong Government Securities Fund held its entire portfolio in 90-day Treasury bills. In the week after that day's 22.6% stock market crash, its chairman, Dick Strong, went on a long-bond buying spree.    &quot;We went from 0% to 90% invested in long bonds in about five days,&quot; Mr. Strong says. &quot;We'll be out there for a while.&quot;    The fund's value jumped 2.7% in the most recent reporting week and has gained 3.8% for the year, according to Lipper.    Other funds have made the same switch on a smaller scale. The average maturity of Vanguard Group's Treasury Bond portfolio has widened since the crash to more than 18 years from 16. Boston Co.'s Managed Income Fund lengthened its maturities to more than 13 years from 10. Even with the group's recent surge, however, government bond mutual funds are still posting slight declines for the year.    At the same time, many managers have whittled cash reserves after building them as bond prices plunged. Higher cash positions are defensive in a bear market but hurt returns in a rally. Colonial Group Inc.'s Government Securities Plus Trust, for instance, drew down its cash position from 25% earlier this year to about 1%.    &quot;When Treasury bond yields rose above 10%, we thought it was a real opportunity for long-term investors,&quot; Frazier Evans, Colonial's senior vice president, says. It's not often that double-digit returns accompany a low inflation rate. &quot;It was a rare treat,&quot; he says.    Returns have slipped back below that level in recent weeks, but some fund managers say they expect interest rates to fall further in the next few months, boosting yields again.    Many investors still aren't convinced, though. Fund managers say they aren't seeing the droves of new bond fund investors that flocked to the market before the spring rout. Boston Co.'s Managed Income Fund, in fact, had net redemptions of about $1.5 million in the past three weeks, or about 3% of current assets.    Although redemptions have eased in recent days, &quot;People are deciding to hunker down in bond funds as well as stock funds,&quot; portfolio manager Tom Urmston says. &quot;There's no new money.&quot;    Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corp., says, &quot;We're marketing our tax-exempts heavily, and they're buying lightly.&quot;    Money managers say much of the recent cash flowing into bond funds has been switched from other mutual funds. At Financial Programs Inc.'s U.S. Government Portfolio, net assets have doubled since the crash to $12 million.    &quot;The money has come from such unlikely sources as our gold and Pacific Basin funds,&quot; William Veronda, fixed-income manager, says. None of it, &quot;discouragingly enough, is new money,&quot; he laments.    But some fund managers say they've detected signs that a pickup in new cash may be imminent. Redemptions have largely ceased in the past three weeks at Alliance's Bond Fund, Mr. Lyski, the portfolio manager, says. &quot;There's been a very clear bottoming process,&quot; he says.    Still, some industry specialists say mutual funds sales staffs have been stunned by the market crash and aren't selling as aggressively as they can. Besides, bond fund investors &quot;had been shying away going into this decline,&quot; A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical, says. &quot;I see no reason why that would change.&quot;    In the meantime, the bond rebound has been a broad one. Ginnie Mae funds, or those investing most of their portfolios in Government National Mortgage Association securities, have erased most of their losses for the year.    Putnam Cos.' U.S. Government Securities Income Trust benefited for much of the year from the portfolio's short-term bent; it had about 95% of its assets in mortgage-backed securities. To capitalize on the recent rate decline, however, the fund has reduced its mortgage-backed exposure slightly and increased its Treasury holdings, William Landes, chief investment officer of Putnam's government bonds group, says.    But some bond specialists say the demand for Treasurys has left some corporate bonds underpriced. Before the bond rally, yields on high-grade intermediate-term corporate bonds were 50 to 60 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, below those on Treasurys. That yield spread subsequently widened to as much as a full percentage point, and it remains close to that level at about 80 to 100 basis points.    &quot;These spreads are too wide to be sustained and will begin to narrow,&quot; James Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, says. &quot;With relatively stable interest rates, intermediate corporates will outperform Treasurys,&quot; he says.    Municipal bond funds, which initially lagged the rally in Treasurys, have caught up a bit in recent days, fund managers say. Municipal bonds are more diverse and less liquid than government bonds. At Value Line Inc.'s Tax-Exempt Fund-High Yield Portfolio, manager Milton Schlein says he recently has stuck to actively traded issues. Issues such as New Jersey Turnpike, Georgia Municipal Power and Greater Detroit Resource Recovery are liquid and provide &quot;adequate&quot; yields, he says.    Despite recent gains, though, the average municipal bond fund has lost more than 5% for the year.    Bond funds invested overseas have performed best this year, largely because of the dollar's sharp drop against most other major currencies. T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.'s International Bond Fund, which rose 4.3% in the latest week, has jumped more than 18% for the year, the best return of any bond fund. International bond funds, however, aren't classified by Lipper Analytical as fixed-income, but as world income.    The only bond fund group that significantly softened in recent weeks was the junk -- or low-rated, high-yielding corporate -- category. The prospect of a weaker economy has thrown into question the viability of some such issues. This week's postponement of a $1.5 billion offering by Southland Corp. was the latest and biggest high-yield bond casualty since the crash.    Still, a few junk bond funds have weathered the storm so far. Oppenheimer Management Corp.'s High-Yield Fund rose 1.3% for the week ended Nov. 5 and is up 5.9% for the year.    Paul Suckow, Oppenheimer's fixed-income director, says the fund currently has more than 20% of its portfolio in steel and energy industry issues that he thinks have potential for improvement. It has steered clear of new issues.    At the same time, however, the rate spread between Treasurys and high-yield bonds has widened significantly as Treasurys have risen in recent weeks.    &quot;There are very attractive opportunities&quot; in the junk bond market, Merrill Lynch's Mr. Kochan says. &quot;But you've got to be very careful in selecting issues.&quot;    ---           Fixed-Income Mutual Funds Rebound                                      12/31/86- TYPE                    OCTOBER       9/30/87      YEAR U.S. government           +3.8%         -5.2%      -1.7% Ginnie Mae                +3.0          -3.1       -0.1 U.S. mortgage             +2.7          -2.9       -0.2 Corporate (A or better)   +2.3          -2.6       -0.4 General bonds             +1.5          -1.7       -0.4 Gen. municipals           +0.7          -5.9       -5.4 High yield (junk)         -4.2          +3.2       -1.2   Source: Lipper Analytical Services Inc.   ---   Money Fund Assets Rise   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 411 money marketfunds rose $558 million to $261.11 billion in the week endedWednesday, setting a record for the sixth consecutive week.   The Investment Company Institute, a trade association,said assets of 207 general purpose funds fell $641.5 millionto $78.77 billion, while assets of 93 broker-dealer fundsrose $601.3 million to $108.77 billion and assets of 111institutional funds rose $598.2 million to $73.58 billion.   Alfred Johnson, vice president and chief economist at theinstitute, said institutional investors increased their moneymarket fund holdings in the latest week because returns onthe funds were more attractive than yields on some short-termsecurities.   &quot;With stock and bond markets continuing to move along lessvolatile paths,&quot; he said, &quot;individual investors wereapparently less inclined to shift dollars to safe havens.&quot;This was why there was little change in the total assets ofgeneral purpose and broker-dealer funds, he said.   The average seven-day yield for funds in the week endedTuesday rose to 6.49% from 6.47% a week earlier, according toDonoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-basednewsletter. The average 30-day yield remained at 6.56%, andthe average maturity lengthened to 44 days from 43.   Banks, which compete with money funds, paid an averageyield of 5.64% on money market savings accounts in the weekended Wednesday, compared with 5.61% the week before,according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based informationservice. Bank yields were 6.86% on six-month savingscertificates of deposit, compared with 6.73% the previousweek, and 7.22% for one-year bank savings CDs, compared with7.12%.</TEXT></DOC>
