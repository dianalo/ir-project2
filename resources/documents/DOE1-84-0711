This modelprovides grounds for comparison between the normal pattern and the practicein leasing of federal lands for energy production. It turns out thatthe practices in land leasing have important advantages over what mightbe called modern federalism. An important question, then, is whetherthese practices can be shown to be a model for other policy areas inthe United States. To demonstrate this point it is first necessary tosynthesize the discussions of intergovernmental relations in a more abstractfashion than has been the case heretofore. While this synthesis willdepend upon tools that still are relatively new to political scientists,these tools will be applied to our traditional institutional concerns,relations between different units of government, policy implementation,decision making, and efficiency. After examining these issues in theirgeneral sense the authors apply them to the issue of land leasing.</TEXT></DOC>
