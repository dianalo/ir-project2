I would look at a means test.&quot;;   The same issue came up in the 1988 campaign for the Democratic nomination,when former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt proposed that the Social Securitybenefits of wealthy retirees be subject to taxation. He withdrew from thepresidential race in 1988 after trailing in several primaries.;    Tsongasgave no details on what kinds of means test he would consider.;    Tsongasalso was asked whether the United States should attack Iraq if PresidentSaddam Hussein is found to be hiding nuclear weapons materials.;    &quot;In thelast analysis, you have to take out his nuclear capability,&quot; Tsongas said. &quot;Ithink the United Nations should be the first recourse, but in the lastanalysis, that nuclear capability has to be taken out.&quot;;    On other issues,Tsongas said:; (check) He has &quot;great respect for Clarence Thomas's personalhistory&quot; but would not have nominated him for the Supreme Court. He said hedid not know whether he would vote for him if he were still in the Senate.;   (check) He favors mandatory AIDS antibody testing for doctors and other healthcare workers. Referring to legislation passed by the Senate, however, he saidthat &quot;the idea of a 10-year jail term for a doctor who did not do it isextraordinary, and I think takes it to the point of being ridiculous.&quot;;   Thursday, the Senate passed an amendment sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., providing for prison terms and fines of up to $10,000 for health careworkers with the AIDS virus who keep the information from their patients.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910722  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  402  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 22, 199100204014,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
