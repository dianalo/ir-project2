(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iran-Contra figure Oliver North today toldgraduates of the university founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell thatcriminal charges against him are an honor and part of a legalbattle he will win.   ``Those accusations are not a brand _ they are an honor,'' Northtold a cheering crowd gathered for his commencement speech atLiberty University.   ``God willing, with your prayers and support, we will prevail,even in Washington,'' North said, a day after his retirement as aMarine lieutenant colonel.   North lashed out at congressmen and a special prosecutor whohave charged him with diverting money from an Iranian arms deal torebels seeking to overthrow Nicaragua's Marxist government.   ``We must not just choose the right president'' in 1988, Northsaid. ``We need a better Congress.''   In introducing North, Falwell, an independent Baptist preacher,compared North to Jesus Christ after noting that journalists hadasked him why he chose the indicted North as a commencement speaker.   ``We serve a savior who was indicted and convicted andcrucified,'' Falwell told some 900 graduating students at thecampus of nearly 8,000 that is part of Falwell's religious empirein this central Virginia city.   Earlier, a Falwell spokesman said the evangelist probably wouldback North for public office.   ``He said last night to a reporter he would probably support himfor any state office,'' Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for theevangelist, told reporters.   Members of a group trying to draft North for a U.S. Senatecampaign from Virginia were among the thousands who showed up atLiberty University to watch North make his first public statementssince his indictment in the Iran-Contra affair.   The chairman of the Draft North for U.S. Senate Committee, JameyR. Wheeler, declined to say whether North supports the effort.   ``He hasn't been telling us to stop, and that's an encouragingsign,'' Wheeler said. He would not say what the group would do ifNorth did tell them to halt their drive.   North, who testified before Congress and later was indicted forhis role in the Reagan administration's most-publicized scandal, isa fine role model for young people, De Moss said earlier.   ``We wouldn't have him here if we thought he was a bad rolemodel,'' he said. ``By and large, this is a politicallyconservative school. By and large, we haven't had much opposition.''   The 8,000-student Liberty University in this central Virginiacity is part of Falwell's religious empire. Falwell plans topresent North with an honorary doctorate in the humanities.   North's speech today comes a day after his retirement as aMarine lieutenant colonel.   North is under indictment on charges he conspired to defraud thegovernment by illegally diverting profits from Iranian arms salesto Contra rebels seeking to overthrow Nicaragua's Marxistgovernment.   About 60 people from four area peace activist groups, carryingsigns that read ``Ollie Not for President'' and ``Real Heroes Don'tLie,'' demonstrated in downtown Lynchburg against North'sappearance at the ceremony.   ``Colonel North is certainly a national figure,'' DeMoss said.``He's, in Dr. Falwell's opinion, a great American and somebody whoour graduates would remember for a long time as their commencementspeaker.''   Attorney General Edwin Meese III delivered the commencementaddress at Liberty last year.   Falwell this spring started a national petition drive seeking apardon for North. The independent Baptist preacher said he hoped topresent 2 million signatures to President Reagan within the nextfew weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
