More than 60 windows cracked or blew out in the Sears Tower, theworld's tallest building at 1,452 feet. A 13-foot spire plummeted28 stories from the top of the white, terra-cotta-covered WrigleyBuilding overlooking the Chicago River.   The winds, which were expected to diminish overnight, whipped upwaves as high as 20 feet on Lake Michigan, said meteorologist DonMorrison of the National Weather Service.   Commonwealth Edison, which serves 3 million northeasternIllinois customers, reported 30,000 without power at midafternoon,but said most would have their electricity restored Wednesday night.   The winds disrupted transportation in the region by floodinglow-lying roads, downing trees and creating hazards fortractor-trailers and other high-profile vehicles. Delays of aboutan hour were reported at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports.   Wind gusts up to 50 mph kicked up 14-foot waves on Lake Michigan.   In Michigan, more than 2 inches of rain flooded roads and sentsmall rivers over their banks, the weather service said.   In northern Indiana, gale-force winds gusting as high as 92 mphcarried marble-sized hail, heavy rains and even snow, just a dayafter afternoon highs had reached the 80s.   Two truck drivers were injured when their rigs were blown ontotheir sides on Interstate 70, and flying glass from shatteredwindows injured at least two others in Indiana, authorities said.   Chicago police cordoned off the streets around the 110-storySears Tower, and some workers there moved out of their offices ashigh winds assaulted the windows.   ``With some 16,000 windows in total, although the number ofwindows broken or damaged is a significant number ... it provesthat the basic design is good,'' said Gordon Jones, a Sears,Roebuck and Co. spokesman.   Across town at the Wrigley Building, the metal spire fell to thesidewalk, which was then cordoned off.   ``There's never been anything like that happen,'' said spokesmanBill Piet of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co.   The wind began rising late Tuesday, and six people were treatedand released for injuries suffered when a store window blew out inBloomington in central Illinois. Trees were uprooted, and extensivedamage was reported to planes and hangars at the city airport, andto roofs of homes there.</TEXT></DOC>
