The uncertainty was sparked when the oil minister of the UnitedArab Emirates, Mana Saeed Otaiba, said the daily production ceilingset by the pact for his country ``does not represent its officialquota.''   Otaiba's comments, reported by the official emirates news agencyWAM, were interpreted as a warning his country might pump more thanits quota of 988,000 barrels a day. Violations of previous quotashave caused chaos on the oil market and a sharp decline in prices.   But on arrival today in Baghdad, Otaiba was quoted as saying hiscountry was committed to the OPEC accord ratified Monday.   ``We are committed to the text and spirit of the accord wesigned,'' Otaiba was quoted as saying by the official Iraqi NewsAgency. ``The U.A.E. signed the accord, and it remains committed towhat it stipulated regarding the production ceiling, the productionquotas and pricing.''   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, traded as high as$15.80 a barrel before settling at $15.03 on Monday, up $1.06 fromWednesday's close.   The market was closed Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgivingholiday.   Each $1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means anincrease of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, althoughoil companies do not necessarily pass along the full increase.   The new agreement by the 13 members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, effective Jan. 1, aims to curb thecartel's recent breakneck production, reduce the world oil glut anddrive up crude prices.   The accord's success hinges on whether all member countries honorthe quotas set out for them.   Analysts said they expected quota cheating by the United ArabEmirates, which is believed to be ignoring its current OPEC quota.   The country has a new quota of 988,000 barrels a day, a gain from948,000 barrels.   Analysts estimate the United Arab Emirates already has beenproducing as much as 2 million barrels a day. They say it isunlikely it will reduce its output to less than 1.2 million barrelsa day.   Paul Mlotok, an analyst for the investment firm Salomon BrothersInc. in New York, said the new agreement was likely to hold, evenwith cheating by the emirates.   ``As long as that is all, they (OPEC) won't fare too badly,''Mlotok said.   The production agreement was fashioned in nearly two weeks ofmeetings by OPEC ministers.   Under the pact, the cartel would limit production in the firstsix months of next year to 18.5 million barrels a day, up from itscurrent official ceiling of 16.6 million barrels but down sharplyfrom its actual production, estimated at 22.5 million barrels a day.It also retains OPEC's benchmark price of $18 a barrel.   The new deal also brings Iraq back into the quota system. Thatnation refused to join the current accord, arranged in 1986, becauseit wanted the same, larger production ceiling as its war rival Iran.   The ministers stepped up efforts to set a new quota for Iraqafter Iran and Iraq agreed in August to a cease-fire in their 8-yearwar. The two countries now badly need additional oil revenue torebuild their damaged economies.   After lengthy behind-the-scenes negotiations, the ministers gaveboth the same 2.64 million barrels a day quota. Iran had a cap of2.4 million barrels under the old agreement and Iraq 1.5 million.   Other OPEC members are Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon,Indonesia, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
