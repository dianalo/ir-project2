The American Medical Association has drawn up its own plan for replacing the current malpractice system. And more than a dozen states are considering proposals to tighten standards for doctors who testify as paid experts.    Courtroom clashes over medical experts are nothing new. Product liability and malpractice lawsuits regularly end up with gaggles of experts trying to discredit each other's testimony. But as caseloads increase and as cases become more complex, the parade of doctors trooping to the witness stand has gotten out of hand, some medical and legal professionals say.    &quot;The average juror doesn't need a bunch of experts to tell him that you can't see as far in the dark as you can in the light,&quot; says Joseph H. Young, a senior U.S. district court judge in Maryland.    The increasing use of expert witnesses has led to abuses, critics say. Among the complaints: Witness &quot;brokers&quot; who virtually guarantee favorable medical testimony for a cut of the damage award; doctors who make their living testifying against other doctors; and attorneys who try to dazzle judges and juries by calling on witnesses with credentials that sound important but actually are meaningless.    Doctors' groups are the most outspoken advocates for changing the system -- goaded by a nearly fivefold rise in the size of the average malpractice verdict between 1980 and 1986. The AMA plan would take malpractice claims out of state courts and put them in a separate administrative system using state-appointed experts. The proposal also includes a set of generic standards that would be used to screen doctors seeking to testify as experts.    &quot;The idea isn't to make it impossible for physicians to provide expert testimony,&quot; says AMA general counsel Kirk Johnson. &quot;But if you're going to testify as an expert, you ought to at least have some sort of occupational experience in the field under inquiry and some recent experience in that field.&quot;    The AMA's proposal is being discussed by legislators in Vermont and two other states, which the AMA won't name. AMA officials say they fear premature disclosure of their plan would give trial lawyers a chance to attack and kill the proposal.    Pennsylvania lawmakers are studying a bill backed by the state's medical society to allow testimony only from experts with &quot;a practical familiarity&quot; or medical practice in the subject involved. And the Illinois Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that medical experts who appear in the state's courts must disclose how much they are paid, how often they work for the lawyer who hired them, and how much time they spend practicing medicine.    Such restrictions are quick to draw criticism from trial lawyers, who rely heavily on doctors' testimony to make malpractice complaints stick. &quot;We would have problems with any limitation that requires experts to appear on some medical society's list,&quot; says Robert A. Lembo, director of state relations for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.    &quot;Screening sounds good and simple,&quot; says Phillip J. Resnick, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, and former president of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law. &quot;But constitutionally you can't preclude the defense from calling its own experts.&quot;    Support for such changes is growing in some legal corners, though. Last November, in an advisory opinion, the American Bar Association's standing committee on ethics and professional responsibility said it found &quot;substantial ethical problems&quot; with the way some medical witnesses are brokered to attorneys.    Brokers, who often advertise in legal journals, offer a smorgasbord of medical testimony. Medical-Legal Consultants, Bethesda, Md., for instance, boasts it has 600 physicians on call for witness duty. &quot;If the first doctor we refer doesn't agree with your legal theory,&quot; says Jeffrey Ransom, a Medical-Legal account representative, &quot;we will provide you with the name of a second prospective expert.&quot;    Typically, lawyers pay brokers a contingency fee of 20% to 30% of the total recovery from a favorable verdict; the experts receive a flat fee from the broker.    Such brokering, the ABA's ethics committee says, &quot;would appear to raise many of the same questions as direct payment of a contingent fee to an expert witness&quot;which is prohibited by most states.    Meanwhile, in cases ranging from child custody to murder, demand has been climbing for the testimony of forensic psychiatrists and psychologists, who are asked to predict the behavior of defendants.    Dallas psychiatrist James P. Grigson, who works mainly for prosecutors in murder cases, has examined nearly a third of Texas's 230 death-row inmates and pronounced them incurably violent -- a critical element under Texas law in assessing the death penalty.    After more than 20 years of examining violent criminals, Dr. Grigson says future behavior is &quot;as obvious as a piece of bone sticking out of the skin.&quot;    But the American Psychiatric Association recently disowned psychiatrists and psychologists who make such claims on the witness stand. &quot;Except in the most short-term and acute situations, psychiatrists cannot predict future behavior with any certainty,&quot; says an APA spokesman.    Also, psychologists David Faust and Jay Ziskin recently reported in the journal Science that medical professionals fared no better than high-school students in predicting violent behavior in case studies.    &quot;Experts are hired to enlighten,&quot; says Dr. Faust, director of psychology at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Instead, he says, research indicates most experts base their assessments on snap judgements or bias. &quot;If the experts aren't any more accurate than anyone else,&quot; Dr. Faust says, &quot;how are they helping the jury?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
