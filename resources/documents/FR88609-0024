Executive Summary</ITAG>Current Exchange Act Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10, titled ``Interim Reports,''set forth reporting requirements applicable when an issuer changes itsfiscal year end. Pursuant to these rules, the issuer is required to filean ``interim report'' with the Commission to provide financial and otherinformation about any ``interim period'' of three or more months resultingwhen the issuer changes its fiscal year end. The interim period runs fromthe end of the most recently concluded fiscal year to the opening dateof the new fiscal year \1\\9\<NOTE/> and must be reported in the format required for the issuer'sannual report. The Commission has required such reports to assure thata continuous financial and business history of issuers will be filed publiclyand available to investors and the marketplace.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ For example, if an issuer whose most recent fiscalyear ended on December 31, 1987 decides to change its fiscal closing dateto June 30, 1988, the period for which a report must be filed under eitherRule 13a-10 or 15d-10 would be January 1, 1988 through June 30, 1988,Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 were adopted in 1948 \2\\0\<NOTE/> and have not been revised to take account of the rules requiringquarterly reporting on Form 10-Q, which were adopted in 1970.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 also have not been updated to conformto revised timing requirements for filing Form 10-K, the annual reportingform used by most public companies.\2\\2\<NOTE/> The amendments proposed in this release are intended to updatethese rules and integrate them with the current periodic reporting requirements.Further, amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 are proposed to codify currentrule interpretations and address issues concerning quarterly reportingthat are raised repeatedly by registrants when changing their fiscal yearend.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ Release No. 34-4194 (December 17, 1948) [13 FR 9325-26].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Rules 13a-13 and 15d-13 were adopted in Release No.34-9004 (October 28, 1970) [35 FR 17537].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ In 1970, the Commission revised Form 10-K. Among otherchanges, the time for filing Form 10-K was shortened from 120 to 90 daysafter the end of the fiscal year. Release No. 34-9000 (October 21, 1970)[35 FR 16919].A. Transition ReportsThe proposed amendments would restructure substantially Rules 13a-10 and15d-10. To avoid confusion with other reports, such as quarterly reports,that also commonly are referred to as interim reports, the reports requiredpursuant to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 would be designated ``transition reports,''and the period resulting when an issuer changes its fiscal year calleda ``transition period.'' \2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ Although current Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 refer to interimreports and interim periods, for clarity, this Release will use the term``transition'' instead of ``interim'' when discussing the current rulesas well as the proposed amendments.Current Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 require that transition reports be filedon the appropriate annual reporting form, usually Form 10-K, for any transitionperiod of three or more months. The proposals would require transitionreports for all transition periods, regardless of length, but permit issuersto use the abbreviated reporting format of Form 10-Q for reporting on transitionperiods of less than six months. Transition reports on Form 10-K wouldbe required for transition periods of six or more months. Like currentRules 13a-10 and 15d-10, the proposed amendments would permit issuers tofile unaudited financial statements for transition periods shorter thansix months and require that separate audited financial statements for suchperiods be filed in the next annual report.To conform the filing requirements for transition reports to those applicableto Forms 10-Q and 10-K, the proposals would change the current 120 dayfiling period for transition reports to 45 days, in the case of a transitionreport on Form 10-Q, and 90 days, in the case of a transition report onForm 10-K. The proposed amendments also would codify the reporting requirementsfor an issuer changing its fiscal year end for a particular fiscal yearafter the end of that year, and would make clear the obligation to filean annual report for any fiscal year that ended before the issuer determinedto change its fiscal year end.B. Quarterly Reporting RequirementsThe proposed rules would codify the staff practice of requiring quarterlyreports for each quarterly period within the transition period. Under theproposed rules, the issuer would continue to have the option to file suchquarterly reports based upon the quarters of either the old or newly adoptedfiscal year. Issuers also would, in most circumstances,\2\\4\<NOTE/> be required to file a quarterly report for any quarterlyperiod of the old fiscal year that ended before the date on which the issuerdetermined to change its fiscal year end.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ Issuers would not be required to file a quarterly reportfor a quarterly period of the old fiscal year where the last day of thequarter also is the last day of the transition period.Further, the proposals would give needed guidance as to when an issuermust begin filing quarterly reports on the basis of the newly adopted fiscalyear. The proposals would make it clear that no reports on the new basiswould be required for any period before the issuer's determination to changeits fiscal year end. The requirement to file quarterly reports on the newbasis would begin with the first quarter in the new fiscal year that endsafter the issuer determined to change its year end.C. Successor IssuersUnlike the current rules, the proposed amendments would specify transitionreporting requirements for successor issuers only where they have a differentfiscal year end from that of the predecessor. Successor issuer reportingwhere the successor and predecessor have the same fiscal year end is coveredby other current rules. As proposed, a successor issuer would be requiredto file a transition report for the transition period between the closeof the fiscal year covered by the last annual report of its predecessorand the date of succession. The proposed amendments would cover explicitlyall successor issuers; currently, only those with securities registeredon Form 8-B \2\\5\<NOTE/> are covered. Current Rule 15d-10 has no provision governingthe transition reporting of successor issuers; such a provision would beadded.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ 17 CFR 249.208b.D. Foreign Private IssuersHistorically, a change in fiscal year has been rare for foreign privateissuers. Where the circumstances have arisen, however, the transition reportingobligations of such issuers have been addressed on a case-by-case basis.The proposed amendments would spell out transition reporting requirementsfor foreign private issuers authorized to file annual reports on Form 20-F.A foreign private issuer with a transition period of less than six monthswould be permitted to file a transition report on Form 20-F with responsesto only a few specified items and unaudited financial statements. For atransition period of six or more months, a foreign private issuer wouldfile a Form 20-F containing responses to all items required when the Formis used as an annual report, including audited financial statements.E. Proposed Amendments to Form 8-KA proposed new item of Form 8-K would require an issuer to report in aForm 8-K the determination to change its fiscal year end and the date ofits new fiscal year end. The Form 8-K would be required to be filed within15 days after the date of the issuer's decision to adopt a new fiscal year.F. Filing Fees and Extensions of TimeThe proposed amendments would make explicit that no filing fee is requiredfor transition reports. Proposed amendments to Rule 12b-25 and Form 12b-25would add transition reports to those reports for which an extension oftime for filing is available.G. Investment CompaniesNew Rule 30b1-3 under the Investment Company Act is proposed to providefor transition reporting obligations of registered investment companies.The new Rule would require investment companies that change their fiscalyear end to file a report on Form N-SAR within 60 days of either the closeof the resulting transition period or the date of the determination tochange the fiscal year end, whichever is later.H. Proposed Amendments to the Accounting and Proxy RulesA proposed new accounting Rule 3-06, to be added to Regulation S-X, wouldcodify the staff's practice of accepting, under the specified circumstances,financial statements covering a nine to 12 month period in satisfactionof a requirement for financial statements for either one year or one yearof a multiple year period. A parallel note is proposed to be added to Rule14a-3(b)(1) \2\\6\<NOTE/> of the proxy rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ 17 CFR 240.14a-3(b)(1).I. Proposed Amendment to AssureTimely Financial Statements of First-Time RegistrantsRule 3-12 of Regulation S-X is proposed to be amended to specify that themost recent audited financial statements in a registration statement underthe Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'') \2\\7\<NOTE/> or on Form 10 \2\\8\<NOTE/> under the Exchange Act may not be more than one year and45 days old if the issuer was not a reporting company before filing theregistration statement. Such amendment would be consistent with those requirementsof Rule 3-01 of Regulation S-X \2\\9\<NOTE/> that set limits on the age of financial statements in a registrationstatement of a newly reporting company.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ 15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ 17 CFR 249.210.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ 17 CFR 210.3-01.J. Quarterly Reporting Obligationsfor New RegistrantsIn addition, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rules 13a-13 and15d-13, the quarterly reporting rules. Under the current rules, a new registrantis not required to file its first quarterly report with updated financialstatements until 45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter endingafter the date of effectiveness of its registration statement. The accountingrules permit financial statements in an initial registration statementto be up to 134 days old on the date of effectiveness. Thus, in cases wherean initial registration statement is declared effective between 91 and134 days after the end of a fiscal quarter or year, the new registrantis not required to file a separate quarterly report for the quarter priorto the date of effectiveness. To close this gap, the proposed amendmentswould require a new registrant to file its first report on Form 10-Q forthe quarter commencing with the end of the latest quarterly or annual periodcovered by the most recent financial statements included in its registrationstatement.An Appendix in Part VI of this Release (``Appendix'') sets forth examplesto illustrate the application of the proposed rules to some typical reportingsituations.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion</ITAG>A. Reporting Fiscal Year Changes1. <T3>Current Transition Reporting Requirements.</T3> Current Rules 13a-10and 15d-10 \3\\0\<NOTE/> require an issuer that changes its fiscal year to file aseparate report on its annual reporting form \3\\1\<NOTE/> covering the resulting transition period if the transitionperiod covers a time span of three or more months. The report must be filedwithin 120 days after the close of the transition period or the date ofthe determination to change the fiscal year end, whichever is later. Thefinancial statements included in the report need not be audited if thetransition period is less than six months and separate audited financialstatements for the transition period are filed in the next annual report.If the transition period is shorter than three months, no separate reportaudited financial statements covering the transition period are filed withthe next annual report.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ Rule 13a-10 applies to issuers with securities registeredpursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78<T3>l</T3>]. Rule 15d-10 applies to issuers with securities registeredunder the Securities Act and filing Exchange Act reports pursuant to Section15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78o(d)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ The annual reporting form used by most public companiesis Form 10-K, but, in the case of most foreign private issuers, Form 20-Fis used.2. <T3>Proposed Transition Reporting Requirements_</T3>a. <T3>Transition Reporting on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.</T3> The proposed amendmentsto Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 would require an issuer to file reports forall transition periods, including those of less than three months. Transitionreports for periods shorter than six months, however, would be filed onForm 10-Q, the quarterly reporting form, rather than Form 10-K.\3\\2\<NOTE/> For transition reports covering transition periods of sixor more months, issuers would continue to use Form 10-K.\3\\3\<NOTE/> Issuers would be required to provide all information requestedin the textual items of the reporting forms, as well as the required financialinformation.\3\\4\<NOTE/> Technical changes to make the description and cover sheetsof and General Instructions to Forms 10-Q and 10-K consistent with theproposed amendments also are proposed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rules 13a-10(c) and 15d-10(c) and Appendix Examples1.a., 1.b., andamp; 1.d.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rules 13a-10(b) and 15d-10(b) and Appendix Examples1.c., andamp; 1.e.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ Form 10-Q provides a more abbreviated reporting formatthan Form 10-K. In addition to condensed unaudited financial informationand an updating of management's discussion and analysis of financial conditionand results of operations, Form 10-Q calls for information relating toa limited number of subjects such as legal proceedings, changes in securities,defaults on senior securities and the submission of matters to a securityholder vote. In contrast, Form 10-K requires audited financial statementsand more comprehensive disclosure about the business of the issuer andits operations and activities during the reporting period.Permitting the use of Form 10-Q for transition periods of up to six monthswould extend the period between an issuer's audited financial statementsto up to 17 months.\3\\5\<NOTE/> A six month cutoff would balance the costs of preparing auditedfinancial statements with the investor's need for timely audited financialstatements. Allowing the use of Form 10-Q also would reduce substantiallythe reporting obligations of those issuers that change their fiscal yearend by three but less than six months.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ The proposals would allow an issuer to go 17 monthswithout filing audited financial statements in the case where an issuerchanges its fiscal year end with a resulting transition period of 5 months.For example, an issuer with a December 31 year end that changes its fiscalyear end to May 31, 1988 would be permitted to file a Form 10-Q includingunaudited financial statements covering the transition period from January1, 1988 through May 31, 1988. The issuer would not be required to fileaudited financial statements until August 29, 1989, the due date for itsnext annual report covering the newly adopted fiscal year from June 1,1988 through May 31, 1989.The Commission requests comment on the proposed six month cutoff as wellas alternative cutoffs based upon a shorter period, such as three months,or a longer period, such as seven or eight months. The Commission specificallysolicits comment on what the additional costs of providing informationon transition periods of less than three months would be, if any, giventhat the audited information must be filed with the next annual report.Comment also is requested on the extent of the additional benefits thatwould be provided to investors by requiring transition reports for periodsof less than three months, in light of the fact that audited financialstatements for such periods would be required in any event with the nextannual report.b. <T3>Provisions on Changing a Fiscal Year After the Year End. </T3>The currentrules do not specify the reporting requirements where an issuer decidesto change its closing date for a particular fiscal year after the end ofthat fiscal year. Under current interpretations of the rules, an issuermust file an annual report for the recently concluded fiscal year if theissuer had not changed its fiscal year end before concluding the fiscalyear.The proposed amendments would codify the interpretation by requiring thatan issuer file an annual report for any fiscal year that ended before thedate on which the issuer determined to change its fiscal year end.\3\\6\<NOTE/> This date, as evidenced by minutes of the board of directorsor an authorized committee thereof, would be the date reported in the issuer'sForm 8-K.\3\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rules 13a-10(a) and 15d-10(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ For a discussion of the proposed new Item of Form 8-K,<T3>see</T3> II.A.2.h., ``Reporting Fiscal Year Changes on Form 8-K,''<T3>infra.</T3>The proposed amendments also would codify the current interpretive positionthat a transition report can be used only for periods of less than 12 months.This requirement would assure that audited financial statements would beprovided by the issuer at least every 17 months.c. <T3>Filing Requirements for Transition Reports.</T3> Under current Rules13a-10(a) \3\\8\<NOTE/> and 15d-10(a),\3\\9\<NOTE/> a transition report must be filed within 120 days after theclose of the transition period or after the date of the determination tochange the fiscal closing date, whichever is later. The proposed amendmentswould change the time for filing transition reports to parallel currentrequirements applicable to Forms 10-Q and 10-K. Thus, those transitionreports on Form 10-K would be filed 90 days after the later of these twoevents \4\\0\<NOTE/> and those on Form 10-Q would be filed 45 days after the laterof these two events.\4\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ 17 CFR 240.13a-10(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ 17 CFR 240.15d-10(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rules 13a-10(b) and 15d-10(b) and Appendix Examples1.c. andamp; 1.e.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rules 13a-10(c) and 15d-10(c) and Appendix Examples1.a., 1.b., andamp; 1.d.d. <T3>Auditing Requirements For Financial Information in Transition Reports.</T3>Current Rules 13a-10(c) \4\\2\<NOTE/> and 15d-10(b) \4\\3\<NOTE/> permit an issuer to file financial statements that are notaudited with a report covering a transition period shorter than six months.The issuer must file with its next annual report separate audited financialstatements covering the transition period. A transition report coveringa period of six or more months must include separate audited financialstatements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ 17 CFR 240.13a-10(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ 17 CFR 240.15d-10(b).The proposed amendments would not change an issuer's obligation with respectto providing audited financial statements for the transition period. Asproposed, financial statements in transition reports on Form 10-K wouldbe audited, while unaudited financial statements would be permitted intransition reports on Form 10-Q. This parallelism with the requirementsof Form 10-K and 10-Q was a reason for using the six month mark to distinguishbetween transition periods that would be reported on quarterly forms andthose on annual forms.The proposed Rules would require transition reports on Form 10-K to includeeither financial statements, which may be unaudited, for the comparableperiod of the prior year, or a footnote, which may be unaudited, givingspecified information for the comparable period of the prior year.\4\\4\<NOTE/> The prior year footnote information would have to state,at a minimum, revenues, gross profits, income taxes, income or loss fromcontinuing operations before extraordinary items and cumulative effectof a change in accounting principles, and net income or loss. The effectsof any discontinued operations and/or extraordinary items as classifiedunder the provisions of generally accepted accounting principles also wouldhave to be shown, if applicable. Per share data based upon such incomeor loss and net income or loss would be required to be presented in conformitywith applicable accounting standards.\4\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rules 13a-10(b) and 15d-10(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ The proposals for prior year footnote information wouldtrack Rule 1-02(aa) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.1-02(aa)] except thatdisclosure of income taxes would be required under the proposals becausesuch information is pertinent to understanding the fluctuations in earningsand earnings trends.Consistent with existing requirements for Form 10-Q, a transition reporton Form 10-Q would be required to include financial information about thecomparable period of the prior year.\4\\6\<NOTE/> As under the current rules, separate audited statements ofincome and cash flow covering the transition period would be required tobe filed as part of the first annual report for the newly adopted fiscalyear.\4\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission solicits comment on whether the audited statementon cash flow should be permitted to cover the period from the end of thelast fiscal year through the end of the newly adopted fiscal year. Underthe proposed rules, as under the current rules,\4\\8\<NOTE/> the annual report need not contain a separate audited balancesheet for a transition period of less than six months provided that anaudited balance sheet as of the end of the prior fiscal year is filed.The proposed amendments also would specify that notes to the financialstatements for the transition period included in the annual report maybe integrated with the notes for the full fiscal period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ <T3>See</T3> II.A.2.e., ``Quarterly Reporting When an Issuer Changes ItsFiscal Year,'' <T3>infra,</T3> for a discussion of a proposed Note to paragraphs (c) and(d) of Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 that addresses difficulties in providingcomparable period financial information.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ <T3>See</T3> Proposed Rules 13a-10(c) and 15d-10(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Rule 13a-10(d) [17 CFR 240.13a-10(d)] and Rule 15d-10(c) [17CFR 240.15d-(c)].e. <T3>Quarterly Reporting When an Issuer Changes Its Fiscal Year. </T3>Issuersfrequently seek guidance from the staff as to the precise application ofthe quarterly reporting requirements in change of fiscal year circumstances.The proposed amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 are intended to clarifythe requirements for filing quarterly reports in such circumstances.\4\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rules 13a-10(d) and 15d-10(d).The proposed amendments would codify the current staff practice of requiringissuers to file quarterly reports during the transition period. The proposedamendments also would continue to afford companies the option of filingsuch quarterly reports based on the quarters of either the old or newlyadopted fiscal year.\5\\0\<NOTE/> Under either option, an issuer still would be required tofile a quarterly report for any quarter of the old fiscal year that endedbefore the date on which the issuer determined to change its fiscal yearend (except, of course, where the last day of the quarter also is the lastday of the transition period).\5\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ Thus, under the proposals, an issuer with a December31 year end that decided on February 1, 1988 to change its year end toOctober 31, 1988 would have the option of filing quarterly reports eitherfor the quarters of the old fiscal year ending March 31, June 30, and September30, 1988 or for the periods coinciding with quarters of the new fiscalyear ending January 31, April 30, and July 31, 1988. If the same issuerhad decided on June 1, 1988 to change its year end to October 31, 1988,the issuer already would have filed a quarterly report for the quarterending March 31, 1988 but still would have the option to file the quarterlyreports either for the quarters of the old fiscal year ending June 30 andSeptember 30, 1988 or for the period coinciding with the quarter of thenew fiscal year ending July 31, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ For example, an issuer with a December 31 year endthat decides on October 15, 1988 to change its year end to November 30,1988 would be required to file by November 14, 1988 a quarterly reporton Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 1988 of the old fiscalyear. If the same issuer decided on October 15, 1988 to change its yearend to September 30, 1988, the issuer would not be required to file a quarterlyreport on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending September 30, 1988of the old fiscal year, because the last day of the quarter would be thesame as the last day of the transition period. In that event, a transitionreport on Form 10-K would be required to be filed to cover the period fromJanuary 1, 1988 through September 30, 1988. The proposed amendments would specify the time by which an issuer mustbegin filing quarterly reports on the basis of the newly adopted fiscalyear. Under the proposals, an issuer would be required to begin filingquarterly reports on the new basis with the quarterly report for the firstquarter of the new fiscal year ending after the issuer determined to changeits fiscal year end.\5\\2\<NOTE/> No reporting on the new basis of those quarterly periodsending before the issuer's determination to change its year end would berequired. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ In the first example in footnote 51, a Form 10-Q wouldbe required for the first quarter (ending February 28, 1989) of the newfiscal year. The switch in quarterly reporting from the old to the new fiscal year mayresult in a period of less than three months that would not be coveredby a separate report on Form 10-Q. Such a period, however, would be coveredon a cumulative basis in the next report on either Form 10-Q or Form 10-Kor in a transition report, depending on when the switch occurred.\5\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ For example, an issuer with a December 31 year enddecides on June 1, 1988 to change its year end to October 31, 1988 andbegins filing quarterly reports based on the quarters of the new fiscalyear with the quarterly report for the quarter ending July 31, 1988. Underthe proposals, the period from April 1 through April 30, 1988 would notbe covered by a separate report on Form 10-Q but would be covered on acumulative basis in the quarterly report filed for the quarter ending July31, 1988. Form 10-Q requires data for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.Issuers that change to new fiscal years that do not coincide with the endof a quarter of the previous fiscal year frequently have inquired as tothe need to recast prior year quarterly financial information so that reportson Form 10-Q for the new fiscal year include information for the comparableperiods of the prior year. In those cases in which recasting of prior yearfinancial information has not been practicable or was inordinately costly,issuers have been permitted to forego recasting the prior year financialinformation where adequate information has been provided as to seasonaland other factors that would affect the trends reflected by the data. Theproposed amendments codify this approach. A new Note to paragraphs (c)and (d) of Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 would permit issuers to file quarterlyreports for the quarters of the new fiscal year without recasting datafor the prior fiscal year, where recasting either is not practicable orcannot be cost-justified, if the issuer furnishes (1) financial statementsfor the quarters of the preceding fiscal year most nearly comparable tothe quarters in the newly adopted fiscal year; (2) an adequate discussionof seasonal and other factors that could affect the comparability of informationor trends reflected; (3) an assessment of the comparability of the data;and (4) a representation as to the reason the recasting has not been undertaken.The Note also would be applicable to prior year information in transitionreports on Form 10-Q.\5\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ The proposals would not require an issuer that decidesto change its year end after having filed quarterly reports based on theold fiscal year to file new Form 10-Qs for those quarters of the new fiscalyear already concluded. However, pursuant to Item 302(a) (5) of RegulationS-K [17 CFR 229.302(a) (5)], specified issuers must provide selected financialdata for each full quarter of the two most recent fiscal year in theirannual report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the first annual report on Form10-K of such an issuer after a fiscal year change would be required tocontain quarterly information for the new fiscal year. f. <T3>Transition Reporting for Successor Issuers. </T3>Current Rule 13a-10(b)\5\\5\<NOTE/> sets forth reporting requirements for successor issuers thathave securities registered on Form 8-B.\5\\6\<NOTE/> Under the Rule, every issuer having securities registeredon Form 8-B is required to file a transition report concerning its predecessorcovering the transition period between the close of the fiscal year coverdby the predecessor's last annual report and the beginning of the successor'sfirst fiscal year after the succession. The transition report must be filedwithin 120 days after the close of the transition period. If the reportcovers a period of less than six months, the financial statements filedtherewith need not be audited, but, if they are not audited, the issuermust file with its next annual report separate audited financial statementscovering the transition period. Rule 15d-10 currently has no parallel provision.\5\\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\17 CFR 240.13a-10(b).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\6\ Form 8-B is a registration form mainly used for thesecurities of an issuer that has no registered securities but has succeededto an issuer with registered securities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\Rule 15d-5 [17 CFR 240.15d-5], like Rule 12g-3 [17 CFR240.12g-3], sets forth reporting requirements of successor issuers, butdoes not specify requirements for transition reporting of successor issuers. While current Rule 13a-10(b) applies to successions even where the successorand predecessor do not have a different fiscal year, the proposed amendmentswould specify transition reporting requirements only for successor issuerswith a different fiscal year end from that of the predecessor. \5\\8\<NOTE/> No transition report would be required where the successsorissuer and the predecessor have the same fiscal year end.\5\\9\<NOTE/> Under such circumstances, the successor would continue onthe same reporting schedule as that of the predecessor.\6\\0\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\<T3>See </T3>proposed Rules 13a-10(e) and 15d-10(e).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\Other current reporting requirements for successor issuersand the Division's current interpretive positions respecting disclosuresby successor issuers would not be affected. In particular, where thereis a change in accounting basis between the successor and predecessor,the quarterly or annual report for the period in which the succession occurswould be required to state separately the income and cash flow statementsto reflect the periods prior and subsequent to the succession.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\<T3>See </T3>Rules 12g-3 and 15d-5.  The proposed amendments would cover explicitly all successor issuers,\6\\1\<NOTE/> not just those with securities registered on Form 8-B.\6\\2\<NOTE/> Companies with reporting obligations pursuant to section15(d) would be covered by a parallel provision added to Rule 15d-10. Thereis no reason to treat section 15(d) company successor issuers differentlyfrom other successor issuers in this respect.\6\\3\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\<T3>See </T3>Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2], which defines succession and,correlatively, successor.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\Currently, many successions are reported on Form 8-Kin lieu of Form 8-B. <T3>See </T3>Release No. 34-9072 (February 10, 1971) [36 FR 3804].  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\Where the successor issuer and the predecessor havea differnt fiscal year end and the succession is solely for the purposeof forming a holding company or changing the state of incorporation, thesuccession would be viewed as any other change in fiscal year and not subjectto the provisions of proposed Rules 13a-10(e) and 15d-10(e).  The proposed rules for transition reporting of successor issuers wouldcorrespond generally to the transition reporting rules applicable whenother issuers change their fiscal year end. The principal difference wouldbe the period covered in the transition report. Under the proposals, thetransition period to be reported by successor issuers would end on thedate of the succession, rather than on the last day of the old fiscal year,in order for the transition report to reflect the predecessor's operationsseparately from those of the combined entity.  As with the proposed rules generally governing changes in fiscal year,the proposed amendments would require, for a transition period shorterthan six months, the successor issuer to file a transition report, containinginformation about the predecessor, on Form 10-Q with unaudited financialstatements. The report would be filed 45 days after the date of the successionThe next annual report of the successor issuer would be required to includeaudited statements of income and cash flow for the transition period. Fora transition period of six or more months, the successor issuer would berequired to file the transition report on Form 10-K with audited financialstatements 90 days after the date of the succession.  g. <T3>Transition Reporting for Foreign Private Issuers. </T3>Foreign privateissuers that file annual reports on Form 20-F \6\\4\<NOTE/> are not required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.These issuers are required to file annual reports on Form 20-F within sixmonths after the end of the fiscal year. Current Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10do not address separately the transition reporting requirements of foreignprivate issuers.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\Form 20-F is used by foreign private issuers as a registrationstatement, as well as an annual report. A Canadian foreign private issuermay use Form 20-F as either a registration statement or annual report onlyif the issuer does not have or had not had during the 12 months prior tothe filing of the registration statement or annual report any class ofsecurities registered under section 12(b) [15 U.S.C. 78<T3>1</T3>(b)] or a reporting obligation under Section 15(d) and such issuerhad not issued its securities in a transaction to acquire by merger, consolidation,exchange of securities or acquisition of assets another issuer that filedor was required to file an annual report on Form 10-K.  A change in fiscal year has been rare for foreign private issuers, andthe resulting transition reporting obligations have been addressed on acase-by-case basis. The factors taken into account have included the differentreporting obligations of such issuers under U.S. law, and the differentreporting requiremens and practices of the domicile country.    The Commission is proposing amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 thatwould set forth separate transition reporting requirements for foreignprivate issuers.\6\\5\<NOTE/> Under the proposed amendments, a foreign private issuer thathas changed its fiscal year end would be required to file a Form 20-F toreport on any transition period. However, where the transition report coversa transition period of less than six months, the issuer would be requiredto respond only to a limited number of specified items on Form 20-F. Theseitems, which cover most of the subjects covered in a Form 10-Q, include:Item 3, Legal Proceedings; Item 9, Management's Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Item 15, Defaults UponSenior Securities; Item 16, Changes in Securities and Changes in Securityfor Registered Securities; and either Item 17 or 18, Financial Statements.\6\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission requests comment on the appropriateness ofthe Items selected and on whether additional Form 20-F Items should beincluded.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\5\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rules 13a-10(f) and 15d-10(f).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\6\ The only subject covered in a separate Item in Form10-Q that would not be included in a transition report on Form 20-F isthe submission of matters to a security holder vote. This subject is notcovered as a separate Item in Form 20-F.Unaudited financial statements would be permitted in a transition reporton Form 20-F covering a period of less than six months if the next annualreport on Form 20-F included audited statements of income and cash flowfor the transition period. Comment is requested on whether, alternatively,the Commission should permit foreign private issuers to file transitionreports on Form 20-F responding only to the selected Items and includingunaudited financial statements where the transition period is six of fewermonths in length, rather than less than six months, in view of the semi-annualinterim financial reporting that is required by some exchanges or is customaryfor some foreign private issuers. Comment also is solicited on whetherthe Commission should excuse foreign private issuers from providing financialstatements in transition reports for periods shorter than six months ifthey are not required otherwise to develop such statements under the lawsor practices of their domicile country, or any exchange upon which theirsecurities trade. If such an exception were made, the Commission wouldnot anticipate relieving such issures of the obligation of file auditedfinancial statements covering such transition periods when the next auditedfinancial statements are required to be filed.Where a transition report on Form 20-F covers a period of six or more months,the foreign private issure would be required to respond to all of the itemsto which such issuers must respond when Form 20-F is used as an annualreporting form.\6\\7\<NOTE/> Audited financial statements would be required for transitionreports on Form 20-F that cover a period of six or more months. The proposalswould specify that a transition report on Form 20-F shall not cover a periodlonger than 12 months. Technical changes also are proposed to make thedescription and cover sheet of and General Instructions to Form 20-F consistentwith the proposed amendments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\7\ <T3>See</T3> General Instruction G(b) of Form 20-F specifying that an annualreport on Form 20-F shall include the information specified in Parts I,III and IV of the Form.The proposed amendments would require that a transition report on Form20-F covering a period of less than six months be filed within three monthsafter either the close of the transition period or the date of the determinationto change the fiscal year, whichever is later. A three month filing periodis proposed because of the difficulties foreign private issuers may havein preparing reports not required by the laws or customs of their domicilecountries or exchange upon which their securities are traded. The Commissionrequests comment as to whether the proposed three month filing period istoo long for investors' needs and whether a shorter period, such as twomonths of 45 days, should be used. Comment also is solicited on the problemsforeign private issuers may have in complying with a three month filingrequirement and whether the period should be longer, such as four, fiveor six months.Under the proposals, a transition report on Form 20-F covering six or moremonths would required to be filed within six months after the later ofthe close of the transition period or the date of the determination tochange the fiscal year. The six month filing period proposed parallelsthe period provided for annual reports on Form 20-F. Comment is requestedon the proposed six month filing period, and whether a shorter period,such as three or four months, should be used. Finally, comment also isrequested on whether separate provisions for the transition reporting obligationsof foreign private issues are necessary or whether such obligations shouldcontinue to be determined on a case-by-case basis. h. <T3>Reporting Fiscal Year Changes on Form 8-K. </T3>The Commission alsois proposing amendments to require an issuer to report in a Form 8-K itsdecision to adopt a new fiscal year in response to a new Item 8. Underthe proposals, the issuer would report both the date of its determinationto change its fiscal year end and the date of its new fiscal year end.\68\<NOTE/> A current report on Form 8-K would be required to be filedwithin 15 days after the date of the issuer's determination to change itsfiscal year end. Formalizing the means of notifying shareholders and thetrading markets of a change in reporting periods should eliminate confusionand misapprehension as to the reasons for issuers' financial reports notbeing filed and should provide an orderly and reliable mechanism for gettingnews of the change to investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of the provisions on changing a fiscal year afterthe end of that particular year at II.A.2.b., <T3>supra.</T3>i. <T3>Filing Fees and Extensions of Time. </T3>Rules 13a-13 and 15d-13 donot require a filing fee for quarterly reports on From 10-Q. Rules 13a-1\69\<NOTE/> and 15d-1\70\<NOTE/>, however, do requre issuers to pay a $250 filing fee uponfiling an annual report. The current rules do not address filing fees fortransition reports, even though transition reports currently are filedon the anual reporting form. The proposed amendments to Rules 13a-10 and15d-10 would make it explicit that no filing fee is required for a transitionreport. \71\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ 17 CFR 240. 13a-1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ 17 CFR 240. 15d-1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rules 13a-10(h) and 15d-10(h). The Commission also is proposing amendments to Rule 12b-25, Form 12b-25,and the description of the Form. Rule 12b-25 provides an extension of timefor filing if an issuer gives notification of Form 12b-25 of its inabilityto file on a timely basis a report on Form 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q or N-SARand the reasons therefor. The proposed amendments would add transitionreports to those reports covered by the Rule and Form.\72\<NOTE/> Consistent with the current extension periods for Forms 10-Kand 10-Q, the extension for a transition report on Form 10-K would be 15calendar days after the due date and the extension for a transition reporton Form 10-Q five calendar days after the due date. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rule 12b-25(a) and (b)(2)(ii).j. <T3>Transition Reporting for Investment Companies. </T3>Instead of filingannual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, registered managementinvestment companies file semi-annual reports on Form N-SAR, while unitinvestment trusts file only annual reports on Form N-SAR.\73\<NOTE/> Therefore, the Commission is proposing to (1) exempt registeredinvestment companies from Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10, \74\<NOTE/> and (2) adopt a new Rule under the Investment Company Actspecifying their transition reporting obligations.\75\<NOTE/> The new Rule would require investment companies that changetheir fiscal year end to file a report on Form N-SAR within 60 days ofeither the close of the resulting transition period or the date of thedetermination to change the fiscal year, whichever is later.\76\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ <T3>See </T3>Rules 30a-1 and 30b-1 under the Investment Company Act [17CFR 270.30a-1 and 270.30b1-1].

Investmentcompanies electing to be regulated as business development companies mustcomply with the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements applicableto entities other than investment companies, including the filing of forms10-K and 10-Q.

Thenew Rule would not specify the period the transition report must coverand, in certain circumstances, an investment company would have a choicebetween two periods.\7\\7\<NOTE/> Like the proposed amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10,proposed new Rule 30b1-3 would specify that no filing fee would be requiredfor a transition report.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\7\ A management investment company making a determinationon January 15 to change its fiscal year end from December 31 to February28 could not file a report for the period from July 1 to February 28 becausethe period would be longer than six months. Rather, the investment companywould file a report, no later than 60 days after January 15, either (1)covering the transition period beginning July 1 and ending August 31 or(2) covering the period from July 1 to December 31, and then file, no laterthan 60 days after February 28, a report for the transition period fromJanuary 1 to February 28.Comment is requested on the proposed new Rule and, in particular, whetherthe Commission should specify the period the transition report must coverand, if so, what that period should be.\7\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\8\ In addition, the Commission is proposing technicalamendments to Rules 8b-16 [17 CFR 270.8b-16] and 30b1-2 [17 CFR 270.30b1-2],and Form N-SAR under the Investment Company Act to correct erroneous referencesto Rule 30b1-3.

The proposed new Rule would apply to financialstatements in proxy and information statements, registration statementsand Exchange Act reports.\8\\1\<NOTE/> A parallel provision would be added to the proxy rules inthe form of a new Note 2 to Rule 14a-3(b)(1) to provide that separate auditedfinancial statements covering a consecutive period of 33 months or more,including any transition periods, would fulfill the requirement for statementsof income and cash flow for the three most recent fiscal years.\8\\2\<NOTE/> However, registered investment companies would not be coveredby the proposed new Rule and Note because they are subject to differentreporting requirements.\8\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\9\ <T3>See</T3> Rule 3-05(b) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-05(b)] and Rule14a-3(b)(1) of the proxy rules.

In addition, under the proposals, the filing of financial statementscovering a period of nine to 12 months would satisfy a requirement forone year of financial statements where the Commission so permits pursuantto Rule 3-13 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-13].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\2\ This provision also would apply to information statements.<T3>See</T3> Rule 14c-3(a)(1) [17 CFR 240.14c-3(a)(1)], which requiresthat the information specified in Rules 14a-3(b)(1) through (b)(11) [17CFR 240.14a-3(b)(1)-(11)] also be given to shareholders who receive informationstatements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\3\ <T3>See</T3> Rule 3-18 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-18].b. <T3>Amendment to Rule 3-12. </T3>An amendment to Rule 3-12 of RegulationS-X is being proposed to assure more timely financial statements of first-timeissuers.\8\\4\<NOTE/> Currently, an issuer that was not a reporting company beforefiling a registration statement could change its fiscal year end and attemptto file and have declared effective a registration statement with financialstatements up to 18 and one-half months old.\8\\5\<NOTE/> The proposed amendment, which would codify current staffpractice, would specify that the most recent audited finanical statementsin a registration statement filed under the Securities Act or on Form 10under the Exchange Act that relates to the securities of an non-reportingissuer may not be more than one year and 45 days old at the date of effectivenessof the registration statement. The proposed amendment would apply onlyto companies not yet in the Exchange Act reporting system because theirfinancial and business history would not be available to investors andthe marketplace. The proposed one year and 45 day cutoff for the age ofnon-reporting company financial statements would be consistent with thoserequirements of Rule 3-01 of Regulation S-X that limit the age of the financialstatements in a registration statement of a company that previously hasnot been reporting pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act.\8\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\4\ <T3>See </T3>proposed new paragraph (d); current paragraphs (d) and (e)would be redesignated.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\5\ Rule 3-01(b) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-01(b)]permits specified registrants to use unaudited financial statements thatare at least as current as the third fiscal quarter of the most recentlycompleted fiscal year if their registration statement is filed within 45days after the end of the most recent fiscal year. Thus, under the currentrules, a first-time registrant under the Securities Act with a December31, 1987 year end that changed its year end in 1988 to May 31, 1988 couldfile unaudited financial statements covering the transition period fromJanuary 1, 1988 through May 31, 1988 and unaudited financial statementscovering the subsequent nine months ending February 28, 1989 in a registrationstatement and attempt to have that registration statement declared effectiveon July 14, 1989. The most recently audited financial statements in theregistration statement would cover the year ending December 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\6\ Rule 3-01(b) provides that the audited financial statementsof the prior fiscal year may not be used more than 45 days after the endof the current fiscal year, unless the specified circumstances in Rule3-01(c) [17 CFR 210.3-01(c)] exist, which include the requirement thatthe registrant be filing reports pursuant to section 13 [15 U.S.C. 78m]or 15(d). In addition, Rule 3-01(a) [17 CFR 210.3-01(a)] requires a registrantthat has been in existence for less than one fiscal year to file auditedfinancial statements within 135 days of the date of filing the registrationstatement.  <T3>B. Quarterly Reporting: First Report to be Filed on Form 10-Q. </T3>CurrentRules 13a-13 and 15d-13 require that after an issuer's first registrationstatement becomes effective, reports be filed on Form 10-Q commencing withthe first quarter ending after effectiveness. Because financial statementsin a registration statement may be up to 134 days old when the registrationstatement becomes effective,\87\<NOTE/> a registrant with a December 31 year end whose registrationstatement became effective on April 14, including financial statementsas of December 31 of the prior year, would not be required to file a quarterlyreport for the quarter ending on March 31. Instead, the registrant wouldbe required to file its first report on Form 10-Q for the quarter endingJune 30. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ Rule 3-12(a) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-12(a)].The proposed amendments to these rules eliminate any such gap in the reportingperiod between the financial information included in a registration statementand the first report on Form 10-Q. Under the proposals, the registrantdescribed above would be required to file a quarterly report for the quarterending March 31.\88\<NOTE/> The requirement to file quarterly reports would commencewith the first fiscal quarter following the most recent fiscal year orfull quarter for which financial statements were included in the registrationstatement.\89\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ <T3>Cf. </T3>Rule 15d-2 [17 CFR 240.15d-2], which eliminates a similarreporting gap by requiring an issuer whose registration statement becomeseffective after a fiscal year end without financial statements as of suchfiscal year end in the prospectus to file a special report within 90 daysof effectiveness on the form appropriate for annual reports of the registrant.The special report must include audited financial statements for the lastfull fiscal year.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rules 13a-13(a) and 15d-13(a).As proposed, a first-time registrant would be required to file its firstForm 10-Q the later of 45 days after the effectiveness of the registrationstatement, or the date on which such report would have been required tobe filed if the issuer had been a reporting company as of its last fiscalquarter. Thus, the registrant described above would be required to fileits first quarterly report for the quarter ending March 31 within 45 daysafter April 14, the date of effectiveness.

Request For Comments </ITAG>Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the proposedamendments to Exchange Act Rules 12b-25, 13a-10, 13a-13, 14a-3, 15d-10,and 15d-13, Forms 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, and 12b-25, proposed new InvestmentCompany Act Rule 30b1-3, the proposed amendments to Investment CompanyAct Rules 8b-16 and 30b1-2 and Form N-SAR, proposed new Rule 3-06 and theproposed amendment to Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X, as well as on othermatters that might have an impact on the proposals contained herein, arerequested to do so. The Commission also requests comment on whether theproposed rules, if adopted, would have an adverse effect on competitionthat is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes ofthe Exchange Act. Comments on this inquiry will be considered by the Commissionin complying with its responsibilities under Section 23(a) of the ExchangeAct.\91\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\15 U.S.C. 78w(a). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis </ITAG>To evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the proposed amendmentsto Exchange Act Rules 12b-25, 13a-10, 14a-3, and 15d-10, Forms 8-K, 10-K,10-Q, 20-F, and 12b-25, proposed new Investment Company Act Rule 30b1-3,the proposed amendments to Investment Company Act Rules 8b-16 and 30b1-2and Form N-SAR, proposed new Rule 3-06 and the proposed amendment to Rule3-12 of Regulation S-X, the Commission requests commentators to provideviews and data as to the costs and benefits associated with these proposals.The proposed amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 would require that transitionreports be filed for all transition periods, including those of less thanthree months. Currently, transition reports are not required for transitionperiods of less than three months, although separate audited financialstatements must be filed to report on such transition periods with theissuer's next annual report. This change could result in some additionalreporting costs to those issuers that change their fiscal year end by lessthan three months, although, in light of the subsequent auditing requirement,such costs may not be significant. On the other hand, the proposals would permit domestic issuers to filetransition reports covering transition periods shorter than six monthson the abbreviated reporting format of Form 10-Q. Foreign private issuerswould use Form 20-F and respond only to certain specified items. As alltransition reports currently are required to be filed on the more lengthyand comprehensive annual reporting forms, this change could result in substantialcost savings for those issuers that change their fiscal year end by threebut less than six months. The proposals also would require issues to file a Form 8-K announcing achange in fiscal year end, which could impose some additional costs. However,the other proposals generally would codify current rule interpretationsby the staff, which would provide specific guidance to issuers on the transitionand quarterly reporting requirements and lessen administrative burdenson the Commission in responding to inquiries concerning such requirements.Further, the proposals would clarify and thereby provide certainty forthe transition and quarterly reporting requirements when an issuer changesits fiscal year end. The proposed new Rule under the Investment Company Act, which is tailoredto an investment company's annual or semi-annual reporting obligations,would codify and clarify current practices and should not impose any newcosts or obligations on investment companies. The Commission also requests views and data as to the costs and benefitsassociated with amending Rules 13a-13 and 15d-13 to require a new registrantto file its first report on Form 10-Q for the first quarterly period otherthan the fourth quarter ending after the annual or quarterly period coveredby the most recent financial statements included in its effective registrationstatement. This proposed revison would benefit investors by providing moretimely and complete financial information about a first-time registrantfor the period following the latest financial information in an effectiveregistration statement. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with 5 U.S.C.603 has been prepared concerning the proposed amendments to Exchange ActRules 12b-25, 13a-10, 13a-13, 14a-3, 15d-10, and 15d-13, Forms 8-K, 10-K,10-Q, 20-F, and 12b-25, proposed new Investment Company Act Rule 30b1-3and the proposed amendments to Investment Company Act Rules 8b-15 and 30b1-2and Form N-SAR, proposed new Rule 3-06 and the proposed amendment to Rule3-12 of Regulation S-X. The analysis notes that the proposed amendmentsare intended to update the rules concerning transition reporting, integratethem with the current periodic reporting system, codify staff rule interpretationsand address issues concerning quarterly reporting raised repeatedly byregistrants when changing their fiscal year end. The proposed amendmentsto the quarterly reporting rules are intended to eliminate a reportinggap by modifying the period for which a new registrant's first quarterlyreport must be filed.The proposed amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 may not result in anysignificant increase in reporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirements,althought the Commission has solicited comment on the additional costs,if any, of reporting on transition periods of less than three months, giventhe requirement that audited information covering such periods be filedwith the issuer's next annual report. These proposed amendments may resultin a significant decrease in reporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirementsfor those issuers that change their fiscal year end by three but less thansix months. The proposed amendments to Form 8-K and to Rules 13a-13 and15d-13 may result in additional reporting requirements for some issuers.However, the other proposed amendments would neither increase nor decreasereporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirements.The following significant alternatives were considered: (1) the establishmentof differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that takeinto account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification,consolidation or simplification of compliance and reporting requirementsfor small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards;and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rules, or any part thereof, forsmall entities. Such alternatives, however, were found not to be consistentwith the goals of the Exchange Act as it relates to the protection of investors.A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Barbara J.
