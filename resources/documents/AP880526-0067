The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission unanimouslyadopted the proposal Wednesday despite a critic's contention thatthe system would be ``bureaucrat-friendly, technology-friendly butnot user-friendly.''   ``What turned me around was other successful (automated)systems'' that have worked ``astoundingly well,' said CommissionerJacki Bacharach, who heads the commission's rail constructioncommittee and has studied such lines in London, Vancouver, BritishColumbia and Lille, France.   Commission Chairman Pete Schabarum said the automated system is``a technology whose time has come,'' and he called for ``acommitment for automation throughout the system from now on.''   The project requires a $50 million investment above the $344million that was originally estimated for the 20-mile line alongthe Century Freeway between El Segundo and Norwalk, which is about10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.   Until recently, the commission had intended to use manuallycontrolled trolleys, which would be powered by overhead wires.   Commissioner Ray Grabinski said the new system will be the firstfully automated, driverless trolley line in the country.   Proponents say the driverless system would prove more efficientby running smaller trains more often and save money by replacinghighly paid operators with lower-paid attendants who would roam thecars.   ``More frequent service all day long builds ridership andfarebox revenue,'' Ms. Bacharach said.   Critics, however, said the automated trolleys would be the thirdtype of rail car to become part of the county's multibillion dollarmass transit system, along with cars to be used for the Metro Railsubway now under construction and a manned light rail systemproposed between Los Angeles and Long Beach.   None of the cars would be compatible and riders would be forcedto transfer. For example, a commuter going from the San FernandoValley to Los Angeles International Airport would have to ride fourlines and transfer three times.   ``As long as they design it so you have to get on and get off,it's never going to be user-friendly,'' said state AssemblymanRichard Katz. ``This is a system that is bureacrat-friendly,technology-friendly but not user-friendly.''   However, the compatibility of the trolley with other transitsystems was not viewed as a problem by the commission, said EricaGoebel, a commission spokeswoman.   ``Passenger studies show that passengers who have to transferfrom one line to another don't consider that as any kind of abarrier,'' Ms. Goebel said. ``It's all part of the ride.''</TEXT></DOC>
