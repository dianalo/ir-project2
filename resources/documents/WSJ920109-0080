According to people close to the firm, Mitchell Meislerand Michael Dobin have been told to go &quot;on vacation&quot; pendinga decision by Shearson on whether they will retain their jobsat the firm.</LP><TEXT>   The two men haven't been accused of any wrongdoing,stressed Shearson executives. They said the suspensions werethe result of a top-to-bottom review and restructuring of theOTC department, triggered by an investigation into thetrading activities of the department's former chief, Peter DaPuzzo, who has been suspended by Shearson.   But the Shearson executives said the suspension of Messrs.Meisler and Dobin have nothing to do with allegations ofimproper trading or matters related to the Da Puzzo case.   A person who answered the phone at Mr. Meisler's officesaid only that he was on vacation. Mr. Dobin didn't return aphone call.   A spokesman for Shearson, a unit of American Express Co.,said: &quot;Both of these individuals remain employees at thefirm.&quot; He wouldn't elaborate.   Mr. Meisler is the OTC department's sales-and-marketingdirector, and Mr. Dobin is its chief operations official.They both worked closely with Mr. Da Puzzo in recent years tobuild Shearson's OTC operations into one of the biggest onWall Street. The department just completed its best-everquarter.   Shearson traders said that once Mr. Da Puzzo was suspendedin September, Shearson's world-wide trading chief, JackRivkin, began a review of how the department was operated andmanaged. Despite the department's success, Shearson officialsare understood to have been concerned about &quot;performanceissues&quot; relating to management. Some traders said there weremorale problems in Mr. Meisler's 45-member marketing group,despite Mr. Meisler's success in getting publicity for theOTC department.   Part of the revamping is expected to include splitting themarketing group so that marketing employees work directly forspecific product areas around the firm, instead of reportingto a central boss, said one Shearson trader.   As marketing chief, Mr. Meisler frequently calledstock-market writers to alert them about published researchreports by Shearson analysts, and he and other members of theOTC department, including Mr. Da Puzzo, have been quotedfrequently in the news media about the markets.   The Da Puzzo case broke last September when the well-knowntrading executive and an assistant were suspended forallegedly manipulating the price of a ConAgra Inc. stockoffering in 1990. Investigators from the New York StockExchange and Securities and Exchange Commission continue topursue that case.</TEXT></DOC>
