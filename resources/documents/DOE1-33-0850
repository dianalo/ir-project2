Methods for measuring genetic damage directly in the humanfetus could provide epidemiologists and clinical researchers with powerfultools for investigating similar associations in humans. Current methodspotentially available for such studies include assays for mutagenic substancesin human body fluids and for measuring modifications to genetic materialat the three levels of organization of genetic material: the chromosome,the gene or specific locus, and chemical DNA. Results of studies usingfetal tissues to investigate each of these end points are reviewed, emphasizingstudies of chemical modifications to DNA nucleotides detected in thehuman plancenta.</TEXT></DOC>
