This book mandates thatthe fundamental science and engineering of these disciplines be broughttogether to identify problems, applications, and opportunities for environmentalbiotechnology. Environmental Biotechnology clearly represents a stepin the right direction with a focus on water and waste water treatmentand pollution control.</TEXT></DOC>
