Subsequent investigation by the manufacturerindicates that the damage was due to deterioration of the hydraulic pistonseals, which allowed hydraulic pressure to load and cause fatigue fractureof the piston seal retainer flanges, leading to binding of the PCU outputshaft. Available service experience indicates that seal deterioration hasbeen observed on units that have accumulated 19,000 or more hours timein service. Binding of the PCU output shaft results in immobilization ofthe ailerons in the position they occupied when PCU binding occurred. Limitedroll control can be regained with spoilers by applying opposite controlwheel movement, overriding a disconnect device. All reported instancesof control wheel binding have occurred on the ground during control checks,but PCU failure can occur at any time with the control wheel in any position.This condition, if not corrected, could lead to immobilization of the aileronsand partial loss of controllability of the airplane.Service history and testing by the manufacturer indicate that the sealfailure which causes the eventual PCU binding can be expected on unitswith more than 18,000 hours time in service. Periodic replacement willpreclude PCU failure from this source. Additionally, failed seals can bedetected by an internal leakage test. If this test is performed at 2,500hour intervals, and units which fail the test are replaced, the seal failurewill not have time to cause flange failure and PCU binding. For these reasons,either a periodic replacement or a repetitive leakage test will provideassurance that aileron PCU binding will not occur.An overhaul procedure has been developed by the PCU manufacturer whicheliminates the pressure rise which occurs when the piston seals fail; hence,PCU's which have been overhauled in this manner do not require replacementor leakage tests.The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 727-27A0220,Revision 1, dated July 28, 1988, which describes periodic replacement orinternal leakage checks of PCU's; and National Water Lift Control SystemsService Bulletin 27-21-1/200, dated April 8, 1988, which describes theoverhaul of aileron power control units.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthis same type design, an AD is proposed which would require either replacementor repetitive testing of certain aileron power control actuators.It is estimated that 1,246 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affectedby this AD, that it would take approximately 3 manhours per airplane toreplace the PCU, and that the average labor cost would be $40 per manhour.If a bench internal leakage test were performed, an additional 3 manhoursper airplane would be required. Based on these estimates, replacement onlywould cost $149,500 per year. If the leakage test only were accomplished,that estimate increases to $250,000 per year. The cost to rebuild the PCUafter removal is estimated to be $6,545. Based on these figures, the totalcost impact of the AD on U.S. operators would be between $300,000 and $8,300,000depending on the option selected by the operators.The regulations set forth in this notice would be promulgated pursuantto the authority in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C.1301, <T3>et seq.</T3>), which statute is construed to preempt state law regulatingthe same subject. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it isdetermined that such regulations do not have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For these reasons, the FAA has determined that this document (1) involvesa proposed regulation which is not major under Excutive Order 12291. and(2) is not a significant rule pursuant to the Department of TransportationRegulatory Policies and Procedures. (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); andit is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of smallentities because few, if any, Boeing Model 727 airplanes are operated bysmall entities. A copy of a draft regulatory evaluation prepared for thisaction is contained in the regulatory docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend andSection; 39.13 ofPart 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
