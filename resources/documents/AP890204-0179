The prices in question are those of common stocks, up close to 15percent on average over the last 2{ months.   At their lows in mid-November, Wall Street was brimming with talkthat economic growth was straining the capacity of the nation'sfactories and labor force.   The resulting inflationary pressures, it was said, would pushinterest rates sharply higher and set the economy on a course towardrecession.   Since then, however, money managers at investing institutionsseem to have reassessed the inflation outlook, bidding stocks up tolevels not seen since before Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987.   A good many observers, including Chairman Alan Greenspan of theFederal Reserve Board, have warned lately that inflation remains athreat.   But as people make their investment decisions these days, theyappear to be operating more and more on the assumption that the Fedwill keep inflation in check without stifling the business expansion.   That thinking is evident in the behavior of long-term interestrates in the bond market, which have actually declined a bit even asthe Fed has tightened credit and short-term interest rates havemoved up.   ``The bullish sentiment in the bond market in January has partlyreflected the viewpoint that short-term rates will not have to risemuch higher and for a prolonged period in order for the Fed tocontain inflation,'' said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc.   Similarly, David Resler at Nomura Securities International Inc.,observed, ``Through word and deed, Mr. Greenspan has proven hiscommitment to hold inflation in check.   ``We suspect that the principal reason for these rather euphoricmarkets is the growing belief that discipline will govern bothmonetary and budgetary policies during the year (and, perhaps,years) ahead.''   In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose8.39 to 2,331.25, posting its fifth straight weekly gain since thestart of 1989.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.72 to166.50; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter marketadded 8.39 to 406.35, and the American Stock Exchange market valueindex was up 3.31 at 324.88.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 186.79 million shares a day,against 196.40 million the week before.   Fears that rapid employment growth might soon touch offinflationary forces in the form of accelerating wage increases haveby no means been dispelled altogether.   For some analysts, those worries were in fact heightened onFriday when the Labor Department reported that payroll employmentincreased by a larger-than-expected 408,000 jobs in January.   ``Full employment is imminent. So is sharply higher inflation,''asserted Charles Lieberman, director of financial markets researchat New York's Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., in a reportpublished this past week.   ``The pool of unemployed is sufficiently depleted that only about800,000 to 900,000 more workers can be hired without unusual wageinducements.''   But Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities,argues that low unemployment need not be an inflationary force.   ``We believe that labor shortages will induce business,particularly in the services sector, to boost productivity,''Yardeni says.   ``If so, then low unemployment rates, in effect, will boost ournational productivity, which should reduce inflationary pressures.   ``During the 1970s, we experienced high unemployment and highinflation. In the 1990s, we should experience low unemployment andlow inflation.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Feb. 4-5</NOTE></DOC>
