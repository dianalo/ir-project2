 Sure, Microsoftgave us Solitaire with Windows, and Novell gave us the Snipes game withNetWare, but Sun Microsystems offers electronic mail and backup functionstogether in its LifeLine product.andP;  LifeLine's combination seems extremelyuseful.andP;  Like most famous duos, you may never have thought to put backup ande-mail together yourselft, but once they're together, you won't want to seethem taken apart.andP;  What's macaroni without cheese, peanut butter withoutjelly, or PCs without LANs?andM;LifeLine enhances PC-NFS stations by providing an improve backup utility andflexible e-mail program.andP;  The electronic mail is definitely the main functionprovided by LifeLine; it can be tailored to meet each user's specific needs.andO;The backup utilities seem more like an afterthought because they lack theslick menu-driven interface that the mail utility offers, but these utilitiesalso offer good flexibility.andM;Install and ConfigureandM;LifeLine uses the same type of menu system for its installation andconfiguration routines as it does for the mail program itself.andP;  This enablesSun to provide a variety of configuration options while still keeping theconfiguration manageable enough for network users to handle.andP;  The networkadministrator can then set up the initial system, and users can alter theconfiguration to meet their specific desires.andP;  The interface includespull-down menus and pop-up windows with options that apply to the specificconfiguration being designed.andP;  The screen is never filled with excessinformation.andP;  Help messages are also available throughout.andM;Network administrators will be glad to know that the configurationinformation is contained in an ASCII file that they can edit on oneworkstation and then transfer to others.andP;  This makes global changes easy toaccomplish and means that administrators can save time by bypassing theconfiguration program when they need to make a quick change.andM;The configuration options for the mail utility are more complicated thanthose for the backup utility.andP;  For the backup utility, users simply specifythe host computer and device to which they will send backups.andP;  For the mailutility, users may want to specify a secondary editor for mail other than theLifeLine mail editor.andP;  The program also allows the user or networkadministrator to specify which of two mail retrieval procedures should beused, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) or Post Office Protocol (POP).andM;Depending on the mail retrieval method, LifeLine requires that theadministrator set up the server as well.andP;  For the SMTP method,the/etc/aliases file should include users' names assigned to their PC-NFSmachine names (e.g.andP;  user@machine) or users should have a .forward file intheir home directories.andP;  This ensures that mail is forwarded from the host toPC-NFS workstations if someone addresses mail without appending the propermachine name.andP;  The POP method requires installing additional software on theserver.andM;POP and SMTPandM;One of the primary differences between the POP and the SMTP methods, asidefrom the additional software required for POP, is that the SMTP methoddelivers mail immediately when it is addressed to a PC and requires that thePC be running and attached to the server at all times.andP;  With the POP method,mail messages can be saved on the server as well as the workstation, andmessages are delivered only at designated intervals.andP;  In addition, the SMTPmethod is tied to the PC, while the POP method is tied only to the user nameand thus allows users to retrieve mail from any workstation.andM;One advantage to the SMTP method is that a pop-up message informs users whena mail message arrives.andP;  Anyone who has waited for important mail canappreciate this feature.andM;With the POP method, mail is pulled off the server according to the user'sspecification, so an urgent message from someone down the hall may requireextra minutes to arrive.andP;  This may not be an issue though, since users arelikely just to walk down the hall or phone rather than waiting for e-mail ifinformation is needed that urgently.andP;  After all, the mail gateways onmultiserver networks are going to introudce delays themselves.andM;The main determining factor for which retrieval method users should implementmay be whether the server or the client has the most available storage spacefor such data.andP;  If the client has room for store incoming mail messages, SMTPis the most practical.andP;  If the client does not have disk space for allincoming messages, the POP method should be implemented.andM;Another factor in choosing mail retrieval method is the standards supported.andO;The SMTP retrieval method conforms to the minimum set of server functionalityaccording to the Request For Comments standards for SMTP (RFC821).andP;  RFCdocuments are published by the Information Sciences Institute for the DefenseAdvanced Research Project Agency (DARPA).andP;  POP is described in RFC937, buthas not been formally adopted by DARPA.andM;No matter what retrieval method, all messages received must conform to theARPA Internet standards described in RFC822.andP;  That can be simplyusername@machine or the full domain-style address such asusername@machine.org.domain.andP;  LifeLine also accepts messages addressed in theform machine!username.andP;  Of course, mail generated by LifeLine conforms tothis standard as well.andM;Read and SaveandM;Whatever method of retrieval users choose, they have the same set of functonavailable for manipulating mail messages.andP;  When a user executes the mailcommand, the program immediately displays the first of any received messages.andO;LifeLine offers no built-in security; once the machine is attached to thenetwork with a valid user name, anyone can sit down at the system and accessthat user's mail.andP;  No password validation is required for mail retrievalafter a user has connected to the server.andM;Commands for manipulating received mail and composing new mail are availablethrough either pull-down menus or &quot;command acceleration&quot; keys.andP;  That is,users can actually call up the menus with the andless;F9andgt; key and highlight theoption to list all messages, for example, or just press the andless;Landgt; key withoutaccessing menus.andM;Mail messages, once received on the user's PC, are stored in an ASCII file inthe user's mail directory until the user deletes or saves them to anotherlocation.andP;  Users can specify a file name to which messages will be stored orthey can accept the default mbox.andP;  The first message or first new message inthis file is displayed when the user executes mail.andM;To read other messages saved in this file (referred to as the mbox &quot;folder&quot;by the program), the user may access pull-down menus or use the commandacceleration keys to access previous or subsequent messages or list theheaders of messages in that folder.andP;  When the user lists messages in afolder, a status line informs him of the number of messages in that folderand the number of the current message, as well as the name of the currentfolder.andP;  Once a message has been read, it can be deleted, written to an ASCIIfile, left in th embox, or saved to a message folder.andM;Message folders are ASCII files, like mbox, that can store a compilation ofmessages so users can continue to reference them through the mail program.andO;For example, a user might save all of the mail about company policies in onefolder and all of the mail about a project in another.andP;  When a user creates afolder to which files will be saved, he can save a one-line description ofthe folder as well.andP;  When LifeLine offers the list of folders available inthe mail directory, it also provides the brief description.andP;  Unfortunately,LifeLine doesn't offer a function to delete message folders when they becomeunnecessary.andP;  They can be deleted only through DOS.andM;With multiple folders, users can access messages only in the current folder.andO;Messages can be saved in multiple folders, but users can access only onefolder at a time for retrieving messages.andP;  This feature simplifies accessingrelated data.andM;Another feature of LifeLine mail for referencing related data is the &quot;pick&quot;function.andP;  Messages can be picked out of any folder based on data in theirheaders.andP;  With the Originator option, users specify a character sequence tosearch the &quot;from&quot; field.andP;  With the Apropos option, users can select messagesbased on their subject field.andP;  Any message in the current folder thatcontains the specified sequence will be selected.andP;  Those messages appear withan &quot;s&quot; designator in the folder's message list.andP;  When the user browsesmessages, only those messages that were selected can be viewed withoutmanually highlighting others from the header list for that folder.andM;For example, I specified the first name of one of the users whose messages Iwanted to review in my mbox.andP;  LifeLine reported how many messages wereavailable, and I was able to browse through them without viewing unselectedmessages.andM;Currently, only one character sequence can be specified at a time, but once aset of messages is selected, it remains selected until canceled.andP;  Any furtherselections are added to the selected list.andP;  In effect, selections can becombined with an &quot;or&quot; but not an &quot;and.&quot;andP;  A user can retrieve all the messagesthat are either frim his boss or about project A, but cannot retrieve onlythose messages that are from his boss and about project A.andM;Compose and SendandM;When a user creates and sends a message, it is automatically saved to afolder in the mail directory similar to the mbox folder.andP;  The user can acceptthe default folder name record or specify another.andP;  The messages in thisfolder can be manipulated with the same commands as those in the mbox or savefolders.andP;  Unfortunately, the List option shows the originator's name ratherthan the recipient.andP;  Here, it would be more useful to be able to accessmessages according to the destination address rather than the originator'sname.andM;For flexibility, users can create messages with the LifeLine text editor or asecondary editor of their choosing.andP;  The LifeLine mail editor is sufficient,with insert and overtype modes, block copying and moving, text search, andthe ability to import ASCII text files.andP;  Users who don't want to learn a newtext editor or simply prefer a different text editor, can invoke theirpreconfigured preference by pressing Alt-E when the message editing windowappears.andP;  This editor must, however, be a simple ASCII text editor that canbe invoked with a specified file name.andP;  I tried the default edlin and apublic domain version of vi and found that both worked well.andM;When editing text, the current received message can be included in the text,forwarded, or transferred to another user.andP;  The current received message isthe one that was displayed immediately prior to the message editing window.andO;LifeLine also lets users include text or binary files from disk as long asthe total message body does not exceed 32KB.andM;Imported files don't have to be restricted to ASCII text, either.andP;  If usersinclude a binary file, they can encode it so the nonprintable charactersdon't flit and beep across the receiving individual's screen.andP;  Text files canbe encoded as well for extra privacy in mail.andP;  Since the applicationautomatically displays the first available message rather than simply listingavailable messages, this feature keeps sensitive messages from beingdisplayed at inconvenient times.andP;  Users can freely check their messages evenin a less-than-private office because encoded messages are not automaticallydecoded.andP;  The user must first decode them with a LifeLine menu option.andP;  USerscan decode messages received on the NFS server by saving them to a file andthen executing uudecode.andM;When sending a message, users can access a personal database of addresses orthe White PAges on the server.andP;  White Pages is the networkwide databse fornames and e-mail addresses.andP;  Users can store personal databases on either theserver or the workstation.andP;  I created a database on one of my PC-NFS nodes byediting a text file so it contains aliases for other users and mailing lists.andO;The file includes data in either of the following forms:andM;last[name,first[name;address; comments alias,;address1,address2...;commentsandM;The BUILDDIR utility builds a sorted directory of user and alias names fromthe text file.andP;  This directory can then be accessed when a user addressesmail simply by pressing the appropriate function key.andP;  andless;F3andgt; accesses theserver White PAges; andless;F4andgt; accesses the personal phone book.andP;  Both databasesare available for addressing mail.andP;  Unfortunately, this means you can havetwo aliases defined differently and address mail to the wronng group ofpeople.andP;  This can be avoided easily by simply not using some obvious aliasesin the personal phone book, such as &quot;all.&quot;andM;Once a mail message has been written and addressed, it can be sentimmediately or queued for mailing later.andP;  By queuing mail, users can postponesending messages until they have completed a mail session and are ready toexit the program.andM;Future plans for the mail utility should demonstrate Sun's desire tointernationalize products.andP;  LifeLine should eventually offer an editor thatprovides support for eight-bit characters.andM;Backup and RestoreandM;The backup utility consists of four commands: the rput, rget, rlist, and tarcommands.andP;  The first three actually are batch files that invoke the lattercommand with a preconfigured destination for backups or source device forrestoring files.andP;  Like the Unix tar command, these can save multiple files toone file name.andP;  For example, the entire\windows directory can be backed up toa single file named winback on the server.andM;When users configure LifeLine, they can specify a disk or tape device on thenetwork.andP;  The rput and rget commands use this devise.andP;  If users want tospecify a different destination, they can either reconfigure or use the tarcommand.andP;  Of course, the device must be specified in the Unix format,/dev/rst0 for the tape drive, for example.andP;  I doubt that many DOS users wantto familiarize themselves with Unix device names just to backup theirsystems.andP;  Luckily, the network administrator can configure the system for theuser just by editing the appropriate configuration file, and theadministrator can set up batch files to enable the user to backup to specificdevices such as tape and disk.andM;Backing up to tape seems most useful for those users who have a Unix hostwith tape drive sitting next to their DOS system.andP;  The rput command writesover any existing information on the tape and returns an error messagewithout retrying if the tape devices is busy.andP;  These two characteristics makesharing a single tape dribe difficult to facilitate for a number of users.andM;I found the tar command, on the other hand, remarkably useful.andP;  When twodifferent users on two different PC-NFS nodes backed up directories to aspecified filename using the tar command, the utility automatically foundtheir home directories on the host computer and wrote the tar files there.andO;Users can even simultaneously backup files to the server's disk.andM;LifeLine demonstrates a commitment by Sun to provide products that areintuitive and easy to use, so future releases should offer a user interfacefor the backup utility to match that of the mail utility.andP;  A graphical userinterface for selecting files to be backed up and the ability to scheduleunattended backups are two features that I would like to see.andM;PC-NFS and LifeLineandM;Sun plans to release more value-added products for PC-NFS users.andP;  LifeLine isjust the beginning.andP;  Frankly, I can't imagine anyone wanting to use PC-NFSwithout adding the e-mail and backup utilities.andP;  It would be as disappointingas if the gum commercials stopped telling me to double my fun.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
