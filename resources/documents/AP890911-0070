Police said 11 people were killed and 34 wounded in the shellingduels in the central mountains that form the eastern flank of theenclave and in clashes along Beirut's dividing Green Line.   That raised the casualty toll to at least 844 killed and 2,508wounded since March 8, when fighting erupted between Christianleader Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the Syrian army.   Two Syrian gunboats intercepted a merchant ship carrying foodsupplies to the enclave about 20 miles off the coast at mid-morning,police reported.   The gunboats escorted the unidentified ship to theSyrian-controlled port of Tripoli in north Lebanon. But police saidthey had no details of the ship's nationality.   The Syrian navy has turned back several ships trying to run theblockade of the Christian sector in recent weeks. Eight vessels havebeen sunk or set on fire by Syrian artillery as they tried to runthe 6-month-old blockade.   Police said the artillery battles that intensified Sunday nightafter several days of sporadic clashes were the heaviest in themountains since the United Nations Security Council issued a vainappeal for a cease-fire Aug. 16.   The surge of violence that raged through the night came two daysbefore an Arab League mediation committee was due to meet in SaudiArabia to discuss reactivating a stalled peace initiative.   Christian radio stations blamed the Syrians for the escalation,claiming they were out to sabotage the three-nation committee'sefforts.   ``We're back to the same old game,'' said an announcer on theVoice of Free Lebanon radio. ``Whenever the committee schedules anew meeting, the Syrians let all hell break loose while publiclypledging cooperation to defuse the fighting.''   The centers of the fighting during the night were Ein el-Tuffaha,18 miles east of Beirut, and the Christian strongpoint of Soukel-Gharb, 16 miles to the south.   The two towns control road networks leading into the besiegedChristian heartland from the predominantly Shiite Moslem BekaaValley and the Druse Moslem hinterland in the Chouf mountains.   Syrian guns battered the Christian town of Bikfaya, hometown offormer President Amin Gemayel, for seven hours through the night,setting surrounding pine forests on fire.   A police spokesmen, who cannot be named under standingregulations, said Bikfaya's estimated 15,000 people were trapped inbasements throughout the battle because the fires blocked all escaperoutes from town.   Both sides battled with tanks around Souk el-Gharb, under siegeby Syria's Moslem allies since 1983.   The Syrians and their militia allies have been increasinglypressuring the Christian defenses along the 66-mile mountain frontover the last few weeks.   But so far there has been no sign that they plan a major groundoffensive into the 310-square-mile enclave where an estimated 1million Christians are trapped with their backs to the MediterraneanSea.   Along the Green Line, Syrian and Christian troops clashed withautomatic weapons behind howtizer and mortar barrages that kept mostof Beirut's remaining 150,000 people in bomb shelters from dusk todawn.   The rest of the battered city's 1.5 million people have fled overthe last six months, seeking refuge in north, east and south Lebanon.   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, whichform the Arab League committee on Lebanon, were scheduled to meetWednesday in Jeddah on the Red Sea following weeks of high-leveldiplomatic efforts by the Soviet Union and France.   It will be the committee's first meeting since July 28, when itsaid its efforts had been stymied by Syrian intransigence.   Since then the Soviets and French have sought to persuade thecommittee to try again.   Aoun, who wants to mobilize international support for his ``warof liberation'' against the Syrians, suffered a setback Sept. 6 whenthe Americans withdrew their diplomats from Beirut to climax agrowing rift between the Christians and Washington.   With Aoun and Syrian President Hafez Assad deeply entrenched,there were no clear signs that a renewed Arab effort will succeed inending the carnage and finding a settlement of the 14-year-oldLebanese civil war where previous attempts failed.   The Syrians have refused to withdraw their 40,000 troops deployedin mainly Moslem areas of Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandateto quell the civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
