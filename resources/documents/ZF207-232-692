 Prior to joining Software AG, heworked for AEG/Telefunken, where he developed a CPU for the AEG 60-10 processcontrol computer.andM;He holds a number of patents in the areas of interrupt processing andautomatic program loading and packaging.andP;  he earned a degree in electricalengineering at the Technical University in Darmstadt, West Germany.andM;Goal: to develop on-line transaction processing software that is trulyindependent of hardware systems.andM;FEGREUS: How valuable to customers are benchmarks like TP1 that are currentlybeing used to measure OLTP performance?andM;PAGE: The issue is not really whether you run these benchmarks faster thansomebody else.andP;  For our customers performance is a critical issue.andP;  TP1 isjust a certain type of logical transaction.andP;  I mean you cannot simulate allof the different transactions.andP;  TP1 is good as one scale, but there should bemore, different types of scales for different requirements.andM;FFGREUS: What things should potential buyers measure in OLTP benchmarks?andM;PAGE: People should be measuring the number of users that will be driving theon-line transaction processing environment.andP;  In their testing, they shouldaddress different types of applications, particularly more end-userinformation processing applications as well as OLTP applications.andP;  Also, theyshould look at performance on retrieval-oriented applications, along withmore heavy update-oriented applications.andM;FEGREUS: What do you see as the needs right now for end-user interfaces todatabases?andM;PAGE: The end user needs a user-friendly way of formulating queries andformatting output reports.andP;  But even in the DEC world we have to face thefact that we now have three different ways to communicate with the user:VT-220 and VT320 terminals, block-mode terminals, and workstations.andP;  Allthree of them are non-compatible at the applications interface.andM;What we can achieve with [our] Natural [4GL] will be the ability tocommunicate across all three devices.andP;  We provide a user interface whichcomes close to what users expect from a PC; that is, we have to providewindowing and things that pop up and help users communicate.andM;FEGREUS: And what tools do database programmers need?andM;PAGE: On the programmer's side, we have to provide facilities such as helpprocessing, which you're going to have to code in the application in such away that it can be handled automatically by the system.andM;There is also a need to improve the programmer's productivity in the actualimplementation of an application.andP;  Productivity improvements start with theanalysis of the application.andP;  We provide CASE tools for implementing theapplication through the analysis steps and automatically generating theapplication code itself.andM;Natural is a tool that combines a technical environment for portabilityacross different display devices with technical features such as windowprocessing and automatic help processing.andM;FEGREUS: What is the future role of SQL?andM;PAGE: When SQL came out it was presented as the user interface to databasesystems.andP;  It seems to have not quite lived up to that expectation.andP;  SQL isfine as a standard interface for DBMSes but not as an end-user language.andP;  Itis definitely not the user interface for database management systems.andM;FEGREUS: What do you think of the practice of embedding SQL inthird-generation languages?andM;PAGE: As an author of fourth-generation systems, I would say that I findhaving SQL as an embedded language in third-generation languages impossible[to accept].andP;  The way SQL is implemented as an embedded language in a 3GL isjust disgusting.andP;  Inadequate.andP;  SQL has only limited merit as a DBMSinterface.andP;  Let's face it, in many cases only a very small portion of thecapabilities of SQL are really used in the application.andP;  It is only reallythe basic access mechanisms that you require.andM;FEGREUS: Given those limitations and the very complex syntax and grammaticalconstructs of SQL, can it live long as a programmer tool?andM;PAGE: SQL is not a programmer tool; it is an interface to a database.andM;FEGREUS: Is the DBMS applications development picture ready for workstations?andM;PAGE: Not quite yet.andP;  When you want to develop an application, one importantaspect is that you aim to develop the application in the environment in whichit will be executed.andP;  Workstations are just at the edge of becoming thedelivery vehicle for the development of applications.andP;  This will happen overthe next two years.andM;FEGREUS: What advantages do you see to using workstations?andM;PAGE: With workstations, I can get intelligent front-end processing.andO;Workstations will allow us to validate and preprocess certain data so it canthen be sent to the central processor for the transaction processing itself.andM;Eventually we will get into a position where the quality of the userinterface will be increased considerably.andP;  We will use more graphicinterfaces to provide higher-quality screens.andM;Another important aspect we see [with workstations] is the possibility ofrunning multiple sessions at the same time in windows so that you actuallyhave multiple conversations going with the computer at the same time and caneasily jump back and forth between them.andM;FEGREUS: How do workstations fit in the terms of distributed databaseapplications?andM;PAGE: Today's alternatives are becoming workstations or block-mode terminals.andO;In commercial applications we very often have to be able to communicate withremote sites.andP;  You don't want to pay [the communications cost of] a packetper keystroke that you get with dumb terminals; therefore the workstationbrings the data together first and then sends a packet back to the server.andO;Basically it all comes down to the flying server approach, where the clienthas a certain amount of preprocessing power for formulating the request andthen goes to the server to have it processed.andM;FEGREUS: What do you see as the key issues right now in database technology?andM;PAGE: One is to have a sound performance level so we can take on the load ofcommercial applications and extend the functionality we get from a databasemanagement system.andP;  For instance, we see the ability to handle text becominga requirement.andM;We also need to extend our ability to handle complex data objects by definingthese objects in a dictionary supported with dictionary-driven routines.andO;This will allow us to get more complex functionality out of the databaseitself.andM;FEGREUS: How long before you have text- and object-oriented databases?andM;PAGE: We've delivered text [databases].andP;  Object-oriented databases from usare a year away.andM;One thing we have to do is look at the mechanics of how to store the data sothat the database management system is able to handle structures and supportthe storing of structures rather than decomposing them into different filesand then later taking the time to put them together.andM;FEGREUS: Do you see any special challenges ahead for Software AG over thenext two to five years?andM;PAGE: Workstations will be a challenge because we have to find the rightmechanisms to integrate them within applications.andM;Object-oriented processing is another challenge that we've got to solve, andCASE is still another challenge.andP;  The whole CASE environment has to bedefined and established over the next three years so that we really know whatwe are talking about beyond all the marketing hype.andM;Automation is another major challenge because as networks get bigger, we haveto manage more and more computer nodes.andP;  We can't do that manually any more,so we have to find the tools to automate that.andM;And last but not least, expert system technology is a challenge.andP;  Expertsystems are not something new, but they are just now being integrated as acomponent in ouw application system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
