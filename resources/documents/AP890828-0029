(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A communications satellite isorbiting Earth after being propelled by a privately owned rocket ina launch that opens a new era in the space age.   The 2,700-pound Marcopolo 1 satellite was drilled into spaceSunday by a three-stage Delta rocket that performed flawlesslyduring a 27-minute climb into orbit.   The launching was the first in which a privately owned rocketsent a payload into orbit. Consort I, the nation's first licensedcommercial spacecraft, released a payload on a suborbital voyage inMarch.   ``Delta 187 has placed the British Satellite Broadcastingsatellite in orbit; we wish the spacecraft folks good luck,''reported Ray Adams of McDonnell Douglas, which made the $30 millionDelta.   The satellite was sent into an elliptical orbit ranging fromabout 100 to 22,300 miles high.   On Tuesday, ground controllers are to send a signal to fire anonboard motor to place it in a stationary orbit 22,300 miles high,parking it over the middle Atlantic Ocean within view of the BritishIsles.   Marcopolo 1 is the first of two satellites designed to transmittelevision programs direct to British homes equipped with 12-inchdish antennas, a set-top box and a remote control unit. Theequipment will cost about $450, said Anthony Simonds-Gooding, chiefexecutive officer of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd., operatorof the satellite system.   The launch was a milestone in the U.S. commercial space programthat started after the 1986 Challenger explosion. After the spaceshuttle disaster, then-President Reagan told the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration to stop launching payloads forcommercial customers. Reagan said the job should be done by privateindustry with unmanned rockets.   ``This is not just another launch; it's the beginning of a newindustry, a landmark event,'' said Stephanie Lee-Miller of the U.S.Department of Transportation, which licenses commercial launches.She said 27 additional launches are scheduled through 1993.   Reagan's decision revitalized a U.S. unmanned space rocketprogram that was almost dead because of the nation's growingreliance on the manned space shuttle to launch all payloads.   Three major U.S. aerospace companies took on the commercial spaceprogram in earnest, and the McDonnell Douglas Delta was the first tothe launch pad. Martin Marietta has scheduled a commercial launchwith its Titan rocket later this year, and General Dynamics' Atlasis set to make its debut next year.   All three rockets are upgraded versions of boosters NASA and theAir Force have used for several years. The Delta launched Sunday wasthe 187th in that series.   The three companies will compete with each other and with thewell-established Ariane rocket sponsored by the French governmentand with a Long March rocket being marketed by the Chinese.   Several smaller American companies are developing rockets forboosting small commercial payloads into orbit or on brief suborbitaltrips.   British Satellite Broadcasting in 1987 selected Hughes AircraftCo. to build the two Marcopolo satellites under a $300 millioncontract.   McDonnell Douglas is charging Hughes $50 million for each of thetwo launches. Hughes will verify the satellites are in orbit andworking before British Satellite accepts them. The second launch isplanned next summer.   The Air Force will receive more than $1 million for the use ofits launching pad and tracking stations for the initial launch,according to Sheila M. Carter, a spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas.   Simonds-Gooding said BSB plans to start broadcasting to homesthrough the satellite next spring, with customers initiallyreceiving five channels, four of them free.   The charge will be about $15 monthly for The Movie Channel, whichshows movies from around the world. The free channels will consistof Now, for news and sports; Galaxy, devoted to entertainment suchas game shows; a lifestyle channel; and a youth-oriented channelsuch as MTV.</TEXT></DOC>
