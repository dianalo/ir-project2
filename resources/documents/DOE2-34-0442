A 37, 349 (1988)]reported significant differences that varied with impact energy in theexcitation of the Na 3p and 3d levels when the excitation was causedby H{sup +} and H{sup -} impact. I report theoretical calculations, basedon a distorted-wave--type approximation, that reproduce at least therelative cross sections for the two impact cases, and I analyze quantitativelythe origin of the above differences.</TEXT></DOC>
