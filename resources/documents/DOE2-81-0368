Pre-drilling geophysicalinvestigations, included gravity, magnetics, VLF and magnetotelluricsurveys. By using vertical seismic profiling (VSP), the depth in theborehole has been related directly to times on the seismic sections andensures that reflections are real. All of the surface investigationsindicate the Siljan Ring area to be a geophysically anomalous region.A composite log, which includes the standard logs run in most boreholes,shows both gradual and abrupt changes in the amount of natural gammaactivity, sonic velocity, and resistivity of the rock. The discrepancybetween the maximum caloper reading and the minimum reading on the four-armcaloper log gives a clear indication of the anisotropic horizontal stressconditions present in the rock. The resulting elliptical and rugose holecaused several compilations both in data acquisition and processing.The micro electric scanner tool (FMS) display shows the configurationof the individual fractures within fracture zones. Current studies usingthe geochemical tool string, consisting of the NGS, GST, and AACT toolswill help evaluate the chemical composition of the rock.</TEXT></DOC>
