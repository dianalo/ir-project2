The all-male sword-carrying legislative assembly ofAppenzell-Rhodes Interior, a northeastern canton, overwhelminglyrejected a federally-proposed constitutional amendment on localsuffrage for women.   ``It does not mean that we think that women are worth less,''said one man who addressed the gathering. ``But it would not makewomen happier. If they were happier in the countries where theyhave the vote, I would immediately say yes.''   The vote by a show of hands came two decades after Swiss womenwon the vote on federal matters and 10 years after the federalconstitution was revised to formally proclaim equal rights for bothsexes.   Swiss President and Justice Minister Arnold Koller, a citizen ofthe canton, was a guest of honor at the assembly, which wasbroadcast live on Swiss television. The 4,000 male legislators andresidents at the assembly wore traditional swords to demonstratetheir voting eligibility.   Beat Graf, the newly elected head of the canton's government hadurged support of the proposed change but was the only speaker to doso.   ``Lifestyles have changed here, too,'' Graf said. ``We cannotforever refuse to join the development in the other cantons.''   The Cabinet of the neighboring principality of Liechtensteinalso attended Sunday's ceremony, along with the ambassadors ofSweden and Spain. Thousands of tourists lined the assembly squareand the streets of the picturesque small town. A solemn, colorfulprocession preceded the meeting.   Appenzell-Rhodes Interior is Switzerland's smallest state andone of its poorest. The mountainous, rural state has a populationof 13,000 and is predominantly Roman Catholic. The state has twicerejected women's suffrage, once in 1973 and again in 1982.   The surprise decision was expected to leave the final say on theissue to Switzerland's supreme court, the Federal Tribunal. Pendingthe assembly, the court had put off a ruling on a constitutionalcomplaint filed by a woman resident of the canton. She had invokedthe federal constitution's equal rights article.   Appenzell Inner-Rhodes is the only one of Switzerland's 26sovereign states, or cantons, that still denies women the vote onlocal issues ranging from budget questions to alcohol laws.   In a close vote neighboring Appenzell Outer-Rhodes granted thevote to women last year. A 1986-87 survey of women in that state of50,000 showed that only 57 percent favored having the right to vote.</TEXT></DOC>
