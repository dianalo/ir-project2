Data processing and storage functions were enhanced wherebyobservation stations were increased from two stations in the previousyear to four ones and it became possible to observe simultaneously atfour stations. Data processing frequency domain was expanded by the introductionof a super high frequency MT (SHFMT) method whereby more precise analysiswas made possible over a wider range of depth than that of the previousmethod. The field test including 59 conventional MT and 212 SHFMT soundingstations was carried out in the same area as before in Oita and KumamotoPrefecture, and the long distance remote reference MT method was confirmedto be effective in removal of noises in the area.
