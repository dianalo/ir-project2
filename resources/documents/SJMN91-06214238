The Palestinians are holding out for the right topick their own delegates to a peace conference, while Israel insists onexcluding Palestinians from east Jerusalem.;    Baker, on his sixth mission tothe region this year, has already enlisted the support of much of the Arabworld.;    &quot;That is the 'yes' we were hoping for from the Israelis,&quot; Bakersaid. Details of the conference, which would bring Israelis and Arabsface-to-face to settle their 43-year dispute, remain to be worked out, headded.;    But, he added, &quot;I think that the prospect of Arab-Israeli peacediscussions are no longer simply a dream.&quot;;    President Bush, responding toinitial reports of Shamir's acceptance, said before leaving Kiev that &quot;this isbound to be good news for peace in the Middle East, and I'm very very pleasedthat the hard work of many parties, especially our secretary of state, lookslike it may be coming to fruition.&quot;;    Baker arrived here earlier in the dayfrom Moscow, where President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevannounced they would seek to convene a Mideast peace conference in October.;   He called his meeting with Shamir &quot;extraordinarily productive.&quot; Also inattendance were Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Foreign Minister David Levy.;   &quot;Since its establishment, Israel sought peace with its neighbors,&quot; Shamirsaid. &quot;We have therefore expressed our readiness to enter peace negotiationsin accordance with the U.S. proposal, subject to a satisfactory solution ofthe issue of Palestinian-Arab representation . . . and I will recommend to ourCabinet to approve the proposal.&quot;;    Neither Shamir nor Baker saidimmediately how the dispute would be resolved.;    But a senior U.S. briefingofficer said Levy and Arens concurred with Shamir. He predicted theiracceptance of the U.S. formula would clear the way for full cabinet approval.;   &quot;The only people who haven't said yes are the Palestinians,&quot; he said.;   The Palestinians want to use the peace conference as a platform to demandstatehood in the West Bank with Jerusalem as its capital.;    Yasser AbdRabbo, a member of the PLO's decision-making executive committee, on Wednesdaywelcomed the peace talks.;    But the endorsement comes &quot;on the conditionsthat all the parties participate on an equal footing, including a Palestiniandelegation . . . designated by the PLO, without outside interference,&quot; AbdRabbo said.;    Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it regards asa terrorist organization, and has rejected the idea of talks with Palestiniansselected by the organization.;    Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc conditionallyaccepted a Baker peace proposal in March of 1990, also balking on the issue ofallowing Palestinians from east Jerusalem.;    When the center-left LaborParty then part of Shamir's coalition pushed Likud to go along with Baker'splan, the government collapsed. Shamir later formed his present government ofrightist and religious parties.;    But Baker noted that the breakthrough nowcame only hours before the first anniversary of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,an event which he contended opened &quot;a window of opportunity&quot; to settle theArab-Israeli dispute.;    Baker will be in Tunis over the weekend, where thePLO is headquartered. But he won't meet with members of the group, said hisspokeswoman. Baker travels from here to Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria,returning home Monday night.;    Baker again offered assurances today thatunderstandings reached with any party would be shared with the others. Thisamounted to a pledge not to conduct secret diplomacy in trying to set up apeace conference.;    In a reflection of hardline Israeli objections to theproposed peace talks, Baker's motorcade was pelted with stones when it enteredJerusalem. Police arrested two boys, identified as members of an extremistright-wing Israeli group headed by the son of slain activist Meir Kahane.Baker's car wasn't hit.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Jerusalem  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910801  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  753  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 1, 199100214238,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
