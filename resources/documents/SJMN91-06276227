The medicineis the first to have any proven impact on the mysterious illness.;   Dr.William Carter of Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, co-inventor ofAmpligen, presented the findings at an American Society for Microbiologymeeting.;   Besides opening the possibility of a treatment for the disorder,the research also provides clues to its cause. It suggests that viruses areultimately responsible for the illness, but the body's own response to theinfection may make the symptoms much worse.;   Although the disease may havebeen around for hundreds of years, current concern about the illness emergedafter doctors in Incline Village, a resort on Lake Tahoe in Nevada, witnessedan unusual cluster of people with unexplained fatigue in 1984.;   When similarcases turned up elsewhere, many doctors dismissed it as part of apsychological disorder, perhaps depression. For a time, it was disparaginglycalled yuppie flu.;   Now, the disease is taken seriously. In the lateststudy, doctors at four hospitals in Portland, Ore., Houston, Incline Villageand Charlotte, N.C., tested Ampligen on 92 people whose lives had been ruinedby chronic fatigue syndrome. Half received Ampligen injections for up to sixmonths; the rest got placebo shots.;   Before treatment, the patients neededcustodial care. They could not cook, shop or reliably perform the simplesthousehold tasks.;   &quot;As a result of Ampligen therapy, the typical patient wentfrom needing help most of the time to only needing help now and then forsustained tasks, such as cutting the grass,&quot; said Carter.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Chicago  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911002  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  340  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 2, 199100276227,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
