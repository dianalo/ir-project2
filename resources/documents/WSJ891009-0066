Friday's closing price of 340 pence a share values Saatchi, the world's biggest advertising group, at #536.6 million ($862 million).    Saatchi declined to comment, and U.S. analysts were skeptical. They noted that the company would be extremely difficult to take over -- at least until it completes the planned sale of its consulting operations -- because it doesn't have sufficient cash flow to service takeover debt.    The speculation focused on potential bidders including Italian media baron Silvio Berlusconi; Swiss temporary-help firm Adia S.A.; and Robert Jacoby, the ousted chairman of Saatchi's Ted Bates agency, now known as Backer Spielvogel Bates.    However, Mr. Jacoby, reached at his New Jersey home, said he sold all of his Saatchi holdings &quot;about a month ago.&quot;    An individual close to Adia indicated it wasn't buying any Saatchi shares.    Officials of Mr. Berlusconi's Fininvest couldn't be reached. Executives close to Saatchi said Mr. Berlusconi might consider a match with Saatchi &quot;irresistible&quot; at the right price. They stressed they weren't aware of any talks or of any share-buying by Fininvest. </TEXT></DOC>
