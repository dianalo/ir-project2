Generally, in the most recent elections when the presidency wasat stake, only about half of those who were old enough to voteactually went to the polls.   For example, according to the Census Bureau, turnout in the 1984presidential election was only 53.1 percent of the voting-agepopulation, up from 52.6 percent in 1980.   The bureau said turnout was 62.8 percent in 1960, 61.9 percentin 1964, 60.9 percent in 1968, 55.1 percent in 1972, and 53.6percent in 1976.      The last census in 1980 placed the nation's total population at226,546,000, and the next such official count will be in 1990.   Meantime, the Census Bureau's most recent detailed estimates arethat total population reached 243,400,000 in mid-1987 and that182,628,000 residents will be at least 18 years old when Americavotes this November.   Since the 1984 presidential election, the voting-age populationis estimated to have grown by more than 8 million.      The bureau points out that voting-age projections are based onthe resident population of the United States including members ofthe armed forces where they reside at their duty stations.   It said these projections exclude people overseas _ about520,000 in the military and 65,000 federal civilian workers plustheir dependents of voting age, and an unknown number of otherAmerican citizens residing abroad _ who would be eligible to voteby absentee ballot in their home state.   Meanwhile, the bureau said that the population of voting ageincludes many who meet the age requirement but cannot vote.   Because citizenship is a universal requirement for voting,aliens are the main group of ineligible voting-age people, thebureau said.   About 6.5 million legal aliens and 2.5 million undocumentedaliens age 18 or over are included in the estimates and representroughly 5 percent of the total population of voting age, the bureausaid.   The bureau also said somewhat more than 680,000 people will beineligible to vote because they will be in prisons or mentalhospitals.      Based on Census Bureau reports, here is a state-by-state listcovering:   _Total population figures from the census on April 1, 1980.   _An estimate of what the total population had reached on July 1,1987, the latest available such list.   _An estimate of this November's voting-age population (residentsaged 18 or over), from projections released in February as areference for the current election season.</TEXT><TEXT>   </TEXT><HEAD>              TOTAL             TOTAL          VOTING-AGE    </HEAD><TEXT>   </TEXT><HEAD>              POPULATION        POPULATION     POPULATION    </HEAD><TEXT>   </TEXT><HEAD>              April 1980        July 1987      November 1988 </HEAD><TEXT>   </TEXT><HEAD>              (Census Figures)  (An Estimate)  (An Estimate) </HEAD><TEXT>    1.
