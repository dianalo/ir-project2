Easel/2.andM;Easel/2, a $7,000 software package, allows developers to create complicatedIBM Common User Access (CUA) applications for OS/2 Presentation Manager,without having to learn C or Presentation Manager programming.andP;  The packageconsists of the Easel programming language and Layout/CUA, an interfacedesign tool.andM;With the recent introduction and growing popularity of Microsoft Windows 3.0,graphical user interface tools are rapidly appearing for use withapplications that use both DOS and Windows.andM;Although Asymetrix Corp.'s Toolbook has attracted a lot of media and userattention, other notable but perhaps less well-known products include hDCComputer Corp.'s Windows Express and Caseworks Inc.'s Case:W.andM;Even with good development tools, however, the programmer has to consider newdesigns when developing applications.andP;  Most considerations relate to thegraphical aspects of the interface, the location and number of targets, theon-screen colors and user feedback.andM;Consistency Among ScreensandM;The location of targets, or command options, should be consistent from screento screen, making it easy for the user to locate similar commands.andM;If related options are grouped in separate areas of the screen, the user willbe able to select them faster and with less confusion, therefore making fewererrors.andM;The number of targets should be kept to a minimum to prevent confusion.andP;  Theminimum number, however, must be balanced with the difficulty of switchingscreens.andM;By nesting and prioritizing command options, screen switching and commandoptions can be minimized.andP;  Graphic icons are easier to identify and selectthan targets that are identified only by text.andM;Color is also an important consideration.andP;  Here the programmer must considerboth the environment and the prospective users of the system.andM;Red/blue color blindness, for instance, affects a significant number ofmales, and many elderly people have difficulty distinguishing saturated bluefrom black.andP;  Research indicates that the two best color combinations arecyan-yellow and cyan-red.andM;Feedback in touch-screen applications is also important, especially if theuser is inexperienced.andP;  Immediate feedback assures users that their touch hasbeen registered and accepted.andM;Various video techniques such as blinking, reverse video, color change orhighlighting can direct an inexperienced user to the correct choice.andP;  Audiofeedback is also effective if the environment is not too noisy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
