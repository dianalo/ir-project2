PAULSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Department of Energy has cracked downon the manager of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant aftersignificant procurement violations were found, an internal memoshowed.   The violations turned up during a DOE survey before Thanksgivingthat showed four major subcontractors at the plant were workingwithout contracts, according to a copy of the memo obtained by TheAssociated Press.   The plant is the only one in the United States that makesplutonium detonators for nuclear weapons. Plutonium processing atthe plant has been shut down since last December because of safetyproblems.   On orders from DOE, acting plant manager Jim Zane issued thememo to his assistant general managers saying, ``It is imperativethat EGandamp;G-Rocky Flats Inc. initiate a more disciplined andorganized approach to the acquisition needs of RFP (Rocky Flatsplant).''   Zane ordered his managers to ``immediately cease personallycontacting subcontractors and directing them to report to this siteor to perform any services. Procurement policies must be followed.If not, such subcontractors will be denied site access and orderedto stop work.''   Zane did not immediately return a telephone call Thursdayseeking additional comment.   Francis Allhoff, the plant's assistant general manager forsupport operations, confirmed Thursday that the DOE ordered EGandamp;G tohalt improper subcontracting practices, and said EGandamp;G has issuedstop work orders for the contractors. About 170 workers have beenbarred from the site until they get proper contracts, he said.   ``The DOE took exception, and I think rightly so, to the way wewere handling certain procurement vehicles,'' Allhoff said. ``Thesepractices do not constitute really good management control.''   Beth Brainard, a DOE spokeswoman at the plant, said Thursdaythat the four subcontractors were doing work based on previouscontracts. She said plant operations did not suffer because ofEGandamp;G's lack of legal contracts.   She said EGandamp;G officials were two months behind in gettingapproval for their budget, which began in October, and have beenpreoccupied with other problems.   The companies working without contracts were identified as NUSCorp. of Gaithersburg, Md., Tenera Advanced Services of Knoxville,Tenn., Cygna Energy Services of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Stone andamp;Webster Engineering Corp. of Boston. Allhoff said he did not knowhow much the contracts were worth.   Rob Robinson, a spokesman for Stone and Webster, said thecompany had a contract for work at the plant, but funds ran out.   ``All I know is that efforts are being made to get us back on assoon as possible, possibly as early as next week,'' Robinson said.   He said workers were ordered to stop work on projects rangingfrom planning and scheduling to engineering to restart the plant.   Spokesmen for the other companies did not immediately returncalls Thursday.   DOE officials said the order to clean up subcontracting work wasdelivered at a meeting held with defense contractors from aroundthe nation to try to resolve problems interfering with efforts torestart the plant.   Plutonium processing at the plant, located 16 miles northeast ofDenver, will not resume until the facility is deemed safe, the DOEhas said.   The DOE sharply criticized the EGandamp;G last month when a report byCermack, Fletcher and Associates cited significant managementfailures at the plant.   Zane replaced Phil Warner as plant manager after the reportbecame public, but plant officials said the management shakeupwasn't related to the report.</TEXT></DOC>
