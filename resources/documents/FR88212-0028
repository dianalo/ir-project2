L. 97-365, 5 U.S.C. 5514 addressed only thededuction from the current pay account of an individual for collectionof indebtedness arising as a result of an erroneous payment made by a Federalagency to or on behalf of an individual. Section 5 of the Debt CollectionAct of 1982 amended 5 U.S.C. 5514 to permit Federal agencies to collectdebts owed by current or former Federal employees to the United Statesthrough the use of a salary offset. Separate rules are being prepared forthe more general collection of claims owed the United States under 31 U.S.C.3711, 3716-18, 4 CFR Chapter II.Under the Act, when the head of a Federal agency determines that one ofthe agency's current or former employees is indebted to the United States,or is notified by the head of another Federal agency that one of the agency'scurrent or former employees is indebted to the United States, the employee'sdebt may be recovered by offsetting the debt against that employee's pay.The amount of the offset may not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposablepay except that a greater percentage may be deducted with the written consentof the individual involved. Disposable pay is defined in the Act as grossFederal pay minus deductions required by law to be withheld. These deductionsinclude amounts withheld for Federal, State, and local income taxes, SocialSecurity taxes, and Federal retirement programs. Whenever possible, subjectto the limitations of the Act, deductions shall be sufficient in size toliquidate the debt in three years or less.The Act also includes safeguards to protect the rights of employees. Atleast 30 days before an offset may be initiated, the head of the agencyholding the debt must notify the debtor that he or she (1) is indebtedto the United States indicating the nature and amount of the indebtedness,which the Government intends to collect through deductions from amountspayable, (2) may inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt,(3) may enter into an agreement with the head of the agency concerninga repayment schedule, and (4) may request a hearing contesting the existenceor amount of the debt, or the proposed offset schedule where that scheduleis not the result of a written agreement between the agency and the employee.In that notification the agency must also explain the employee's rights.As required by 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and in conformity with 5 CFR Part 550,Subpart K, DOT is promulgating regulations to implement the offset provisionsof the Debt Collection Act of 1982 with regard to Federal employees whoare indebted to the United States.The procedures established here are designed to formalize a strong debtcollection effort by DOT. Salary offset would be used as one tool to achievethe goal of effective and efficient debt collection, while providing appropriatesafeguards for the due process rights of the individuals.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Process Matters  </ITAG>This regulation is classified as a ``non-major'' regulation under ExecutiveOrder 12291. This regulation has also been evaluated under the Departmentof Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; the regulationis not significant under those procedures and its economic impact is expectedto be so minimal that a full economic evaluation is not warranted. Thisregulation does not require an environmental impact statement under theNational Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq.</T3>) because it is not a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment.  This rule is being promulgated as a final rule. The Department has notpreviously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on this matter. Underthe Administrative Procedure Act, notice and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required with respect to rules of agency organization,practice or procedure (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A)). This is a procedural rulethat falls within this exception to the notice and comment requirement. In any case, the Administrative Procedure Act excepts rules from the noticeand comment requirement where the agency finds for good cause that noticeand public procedure are unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary to thepublic interest, 5 U.S.C. 555(b)(3)(B). The Department makes this findingin this case. The Department has been informed by the Treasury Departmentthat there are several hundred claims against DOT employees which may besubject to collection by means of salary offset. Collection of these debtsowed the United States would clearly be in the public interest. However,case law (<T3>see American Bankers Association </T3>v.<T3> Bennett,</T3> 618 F. Supp. 1528 (D.C.D.C., 1985)) (subsequently vacatedfor reasons not relevant to the point for which the case is cited, 802F.2d 1478 (D.C. Cir., 1986)) suggests that the Department may lack authorityto use Debt Collection Act offset procedures in the absence of a rule likethis one. To resolve this legal uncertainty and ensure that the Departmentcan begin to use the offset mechanism authorized by the statute, the Departmentneeds to promulgate a final rule at this time.  The Department does, however, solicit public comment on the provisionsof this rule. A 60-day comment period is being provided. The Departmentwill review the comments, amend the rule if appropriate, and publish anotice indicating the Department's responses to the comments.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 92  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Debt collection, Government employees.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department of Transportationadopts a new Part 92 to Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, to readas follows:  <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 92_RECOVERING DEBTS TO THE UNITED STATES BY SALARY OFFSET  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.3 Scope. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.5 Definitions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.7 Notice, hearing, written response and decision.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.9 Exceptions to notice, hearing, written response, and final decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.11 Demand for payment.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.13 Request for hearing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.15 Request for hearing after time expires.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.17 Form of hearings and written decisions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.19 Obtaining the services of a hearing official.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.21 Deduction from pay.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.23 Collection.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.25 Source of deductions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.27 Duration of deductions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.29 Limitation on amount of deductions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.31 Liquidation from final payment.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.33 Recovery from other payments due a separated employee.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.35 Interest, penalties and administrative costs.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.37 Non-waiver of rights by payment.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.39 Refunds.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.41 Requesting recovery when the Department is not the paying agency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.43 Requests for recovery when the Department is the paying agency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">92.45 Other debt collections.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 5 U.S.C. 5514, as amended; 5 CFR Part 550, SubpartK; 4 CFR Parts 101-105.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 92.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.  </ITAG>This part implements 5 U.S.C. 5514 (Installment Deduction for Indebtednessto the United States), as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub.L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749, 1751).
