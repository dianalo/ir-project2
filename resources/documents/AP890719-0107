(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A day full of thunderstorms with plenty ofhail and lightning means a good day at the office for Bruce Boe.   He and a team of 200 researchers from across the country are partof the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project, a $2.3 million effort thatinvolves scientists and students from 12 universities, 10federal andstate agencies and five private companies.   Their aim is to find ways to reduce hail and enhance rainfall,and also to learn more about the atmosphere around the storms.   ``Actually, we've made tremendous progress,'' said Boe, directorof the North Dakota Atmospheric Resource Board and one of theproject organizers. ``There's something you can learn from everycloud.''   ``The bigger the better,'' added George Bershinsky, a weatherresearcher from the University of Wyoming. He pilots an airplaneused for tracing and studying storms, cloud physics and air motion.   The thunderstorm project, which began June 12 and will end July22, uses six airplanes along with a complex system of ground radarto study hail as well as the structure of storms _ the processesthat produce lightning and the role clouds play in the transport ofgases like ozone and carbon monoxide through the atmosphere.   But in severe weather, the planes fly mainly during the day forsafety, Boe said. ``We haven't had as many really big thunderstormsas we would have liked at the hours we would have liked,'' he said.   Five graduate and 10 undergraduate students, whose trainingranges from meteorology and physics to engineering and computerscience, are using the project as a summer job. Their work is beingfinanced by a special National Science Foundation program forstudents.   Seven of the students, representing universities from New York toWyoming, are nicknamed ``hail chasers,'' because they are dispatchedduring storms to catch and measure hail.   Last week, when golf-ball size hail and a tornado were reportedabout 100 miles north of Bismarck, the hail chasers were sent out tocollect samples. But they got a ribbing from their co-workers afterthey missed the severe weather and wound up in an area of only lightrain.   ``We're still trying to get our great hail,'' said Brenda Pobanz,who just graduated from the University of North Dakota with a degreein meteorology.   Researchers from a number of countries with weather-managementprograms, including Greece, Jordan, Morocco and South Africa, havevisited or are planning to visit the project to learn from the NorthDakota experience, Boe said.   Of the 60 or 70 weather experiments conducted, about four dozenhave been successful, Boe said.   The research team terms an experiment a success if ``the weatherelements are there and the equipment works properly and measureswhat we want it to measure,'' he said.   The project is being financed primarily by the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation.   Boe said Bismarck was selected as the site because his agency hasbeen conducting weather research with NOAA for nearly a decade andhas the facilities and expertise.   It may take several years to analyze all of the data accumulatedduring the project, said Boe, who hopes for a follow-up project.   ``This project won't answer all the questions aboutthunderstorms,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
