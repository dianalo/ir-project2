It may be most effective for early, small lesions, where limitationsof light distribution in tissue are minimized, and randomized trialsfor several sites are underway to compare efficacy with standard therapy.It appears to offer effective palliation for advanced lesions, and maybe the only treatment available for some patients who have failed surgery,radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Future clinical research will likelyinvolve attempts to maximize the therapeutic ratio by studying variouslight dose fractionation schemes and by using PDT in conjunction withhyperthermia.</TEXT></DOC>
