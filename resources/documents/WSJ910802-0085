Chairman Thomas Plaskett, pressing him toconsider all &quot;reasonable&quot; offers for the ailing carrier'sassets, according to a top Skinner aide.   Mr. Plaskett, meanwhile, asked the airline company'screditors committee for a $14 million compensation packagefor himself and 180 other executives of Pan Am, which isoperating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection. Thecommittee has offered the executives $10.2 million plus $1.5million in performance-based bonuses for the chairman and twoother officials.</LP><TEXT>   The compensation request comes amid widespread grumblingabout Mr. Plaskett's handling of recent negotiations with PanAm's various suitors. The aide to Mr. Skinner, who is knownto be annoyed at Mr. Plaskett, said the TransportationDepartment is getting complaints from &quot;throughout theindustry&quot; that the chairman has brushed off all offers exceptfor one from Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines.   Pan Am signed an agreement last weekend to sell Delta itsEuropean operations, Pan Am Shuttle and other assets for $310million. The transportation secretary, the aide said, isupset that Mr. Plaskett appears to have quickly rebuffedapproaches from UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Trans WorldAirlines.   The aide stressed that the letter didn't mean thedepartment would disapprove of a Delta-Pan Am transaction butrather that officials would be more comfortable approving itif they were convinced that Mr. Plaskett and the company'screditors have scrutinized all serious offers.   In response to the letter, a Pan Am spokesman said: &quot;Mr.Skinner can be assured that we're going to give everyconsideration to this process. Mr. Skinner knows that Pan Amhas been an open book for three years.&quot;   The Pan Am spokesman said of the Delta pact, &quot;This is nota backroom deal.&quot; A Delta spokesman said, &quot;We're surprisedand concerned that the secretary would express to Pan Am hisviews of how it should negotiate with respect to atransaction that will be presented to the department forreview.&quot;   Under Pan Am's proposed compensation package, Mr. Plaskettand two other members of Pan Am's office of the chairmanwould receive a combined severance payment of $1.9 million,according to people familiar with the proposal. Acounteroffer by Pan Am's creditors committee would give thethree top executives $1,065,000.   The two other members of the office of the chairman arePeter T. McHugh, chief operating officer, and Richard H.Francis, chief financial officer. Mr. Plaskett's annualsalary is $500,000; Mr. McHugh gets $300,000; and Mr. Francisreceives $265,000.   Pan Am also is seeking to give the three executives atotal of $2.5 million in bonuses tied in part to a sale ofPan Am's European divison and a reorganization of Pan Am intoa smaller Latin American operation. Of that amount, Mr.Plaskett would receive 50%, and the other half would be splitbetween Mr. McHugh and Mr. Francis.   As part of its counterproposal, the committee is offeringthe three executives $1.5 million in extra bonuses based on acarrot-and-stick approach. The bonuses would depend on afour-point performance measure involving the amount ofproceeds from asset sales, the number of Pan Am jobs saved, anarrowing in losses and what creditors get.   Under the Pan Am plan, a group of 178 executives below theairline's top three officials would get $9.6 million inseverance and other payments, including retention bonuses forexecutives who stay at the company. The creditors areoffering those executives $9.1 million.   The Pan Am spokesman said, &quot;These proposed amounts arereasonable and are in line with severence and retentionpackages at other companies.&quot; Any compensation package mustbe approved by Pan Am's bankruptcy court judge.   Transportation Department dissatisfaction with Mr.Plaskett's negotiations could make it difficult for thedepartment to give the Pan Am-Delta pact the speedy reviewthat Mr. Plaskett has requested. For one thing, it would makeit more likely that other suitors would challenge thetransaction in department proceedings and possibly in thecourts. For another, it undermines the presumption that thedepartment uses to approve such transactionsthat the freemarket has worked properly and efficiently in allocating suchassets as international routes-department aides said.   In another examination of Mr. Plaskett's role, thecreditors committee yesterday filed a court order that, underbankruptcy law, requires Mr. Plaskett and other peopleinvolved in Pan Am's talks to discuss their negotiationsunder oath. The inquiry is designed to examine whethersuitors had a level playing field.   The committee is trying to assemble evidence to convincethe bankruptcy court judge that Mr. Plaskett should beremoved from heading Pan Am's reorganization, or at least toshow that management should not possess the exclusive rightto submit a reorganization plan. To that end, according toLeon Marcus, the committee's outside lawyer, an additionalfiling is expected today to allow the creditors committee topresent a reorganization plan in addition to any planpresented by management.   ---   Brett Pulley and Bridget O'Brian contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
