InOakland Municipal Court, the defendant spoke for several seconds in a low,calm voice despite Judge Vernon Moore's warning that a prosecutor was presentwho would &quot;be glad to use anything&quot; Barnett said against him. &quot;You got thewrong person,&quot; said Barnett, who yawned when Assistant District Attorney AnnKenfield asked that bail be denied. &quot;So this is nothing but a bunch of lies. Iwill prove it in court,&quot; said Barnett, 43, who faces 14 sex charges. A secondsuspect is still at large.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BAIL DENIED FOR RAPIST ACCUSED OF NEW ATTACK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Bay Area in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910614  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  115  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 14, 199100166051,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
