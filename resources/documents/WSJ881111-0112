Miller and Paul B. Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP PRO </IN><TEXT>   Inside International Business Machines Corp., it's suddenly fashionable to bad-mouth the way things always worked at the world's largest computer company.    The old IBM had too many layers of bureaucrats planning budgets, scoffs one executive. Too many people double-checking products, says another. The loudest revisionist of all is Chairman John Akers, who bluntly says the old IBM was so flush with success it lost track of its customers.    The new watchword of the Akers regime: &quot;Just Say No&quot; to unnecessary requests from hidebound higher-ups.    Inside the new IBM, it's also chic to be &quot;open&quot; to the outside world. The new IBM invites customers into its secret product-planning sessions. It admits non-IBM &quot;partners&quot; onto its own salesmen's sacred turf. It gives its designers the once-heretical mandate to make sure their machines will hook up to products outside the Big Blue empire.    What we have here, to use an image that makes IBMers wince, is another great experiment in glasnost and perestroika: opening things up and reinvigorating the organization through restructuring.    Like that other grand experiment, this one is being tried on a giant, calcified institution in deep need of modernization. When IBM's program began in earnest two years ago, the company was in the throes of its deepest trauma since the Great Depression, a profit slump and slippage in market share that dragged on for three years.    Today, Mr. Akers's makeover is showing results that the other perestroika's architects would envy. IBM's earnings will be up about 14% this year and probably at least that much in 1989. Its tangle of products is starting to look more rational and more alluring to customers. Its laggard stock is again one of the most recommended high-tech issues on the Street.    This improvement may only get 1989 earnings back to the 1984 peak. And much of it will come from product cycles that won't necessarily carry into the 1990s. But even if hard tmes return, IBM should be in better shape to weather them. Overhead costs are rising at so much slower a pace now that profit margins can grow with just a 6% annual revenue gain, instead of the 14% needed three years ago.    Mr Akers, a 53-year-old former Yale hockey player and Navy fighter pilot, still faces profound inertia within IBM. Even with its work force slashed, the colossus has one of the world's most luxuriantly thick bureaucracies. And his changes threatens one of IBM's most admired features: its employees' unswerving loyalty to their company andits traditions. The changes are, in a way, an assault on the vaunted IBM culture.    But Mr. Akers is emerging as the most iconoclastic leader in IBM's history. He is one who seems to be willing to compromise the company's traditional drive for rapid growth in order to shore up its profitability. Under him, IBM has been unusually aggressive about raising prices, making the company a more robust but less predatory competitor.    His hard-edged, skeptical public statements about IBM's prospects contrast with the sky's-the-limit rhetoric he and his predecessors used to favor. Just five years ago IBM openly nurtured visions of becoming a $100 billion company by 1990. It's a goal the company seems likely to miss by $30 billion.    Asked earlier this year by IBM's employee magazine to forecast growth over the next five years, Mr. Akers set two goals for the company's financial health: a 20% profit margin and 20% return on investment. (Both figures now are around 15%.) On revenue and earnings, he was silent.    Pressed on this point in a recent interview, Mr. Akers would only invoke IBM's longstanding, deeply ambiguous sales goal: &quot;to grow with the industry&quot; -- in other words, to maintain or expand market share. It is a goal, Mr. Akers admitted, that IBM has missed for the last three years.    The Akers strategy to get IBM moving again rests as much on culture as it does on technology and marketing. &quot;I suppose we are as far along as 75 years of history would allow,&quot; Mr. Akers says.    Clinging zealously to a policy of no layoffs, IBM has nonetheless shrunk its work force over 2 1/2 years by about 18,000 people, or 4%. It has done it through early retirements and a huge program of reassigning its employees around the world -- in particular, turning staff functionaries into sales people. It is mothballing five of 19 U.S. factories. IBM may not lay people off, but many employees facing reassignment leave.    Between mid-1986 and 1991, IBM says, the company's work force will fall by 21,000, and an additional 29,000 will change jobs. It is America's biggest redeployment since the soldiers came back from World War II, the company says.    The ranks of bosses are thinning, too. The head count at headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. -- 7,000 in 1985 -- has plunged to about 2,700. By the end of next year, IBM will have sliced away an entire layer of management, some 9,000 people. That will leave it with just five to seven layers in most areas.    Besides shaking up people's jobs, IBM is hacking away at bad habits and inefficient processes that have taken root over seven decades. This is a dense thicket indeed. Budget planners write reports about coming reports. Official design monitors sometimes sit in on design meetings to make sure every step of the official IBM design process is followed. A Market Release Operations department makes sure all the right managers bless every product announcement. Market Release Operations often bumps into special &quot;focal point&quot; staff members from a product-development group -- doing largely the same exercise.    Many of these patterns date back to a more autocratic IBM. For 57 years power was concentrated in a single person, first founder Thomas J. Watson and then his son, Thomas Jr. Dispersing that power -- and stripping away the elaborate mechanisms that let the Watsons keep tabs on their underlings -- has been a hallmark of the Akers restructuring.    The new slogan about objecting to unnecessary management requests has entered IBMers' everyday speech. &quot;Hopefully, we can practice 'just say no' to some things that come down from upper management,&quot; says Bradley Geerdes, a young marketing staffer in Rye Brook, N.Y., explaining how his group of five will handle the work that seven used to do.    To purge the big old bureaucracy, IBM has created a new little one. Run by Robert Talbot, whose formal title is director of quality, the five-member team was dispatched last year on a mission to zap needless work throughout the IBM empire.    The Talbot squad has had no trouble finding targets. &quot;There's layer upon layer upon layer,&quot; Mr. Talbot says with a sigh. IBM raised by two to four times the size of a special price deal a salesman can offer without headquarters approval. It cut its product-development cycle in half, in part by running certain phases simultaneously. In 18 months it spiked 36 in-house publications.    In Research Triangle Park, N.C., IBM eliminated the jobs of more than 100 &quot;inspectors&quot; who patrolled the factory floors there and monitored newly built products. &quot;It was a crutch,&quot; acknowledges Richard Daugherty, manager for the area, who now holds workers directly responsible for what they build. &quot;Our mentality a few years ago said you had to check people -- I don't know why.&quot;    The zapping reaches to the very top of IBM. In January, Mr. Akers broke the corporation into six groups, each with sweeping new authority to run more like an independent company. An ancient ritual, the days-long presentation of the annual plan to the chairman, has been compressed into a few hours. The longer planning sessions go on inside the six new groups.    IBM, contends Mr. Talbot, &quot;had started to worship controls for their own sake. They became an end in themselves rather than a means to an end.&quot;    People who do business with the company say it is slowly streamlining its decision-making bureaucracy. &quot;There used to be a black hole,&quot; says David Norman, chairman of the Businessland Inc. computer retail chain. &quot;It's never as fast as I would like it, but at least it's moving in the right direction.&quot;    There still may be some overlap. To greet a reporter on a recent visit to the Research Triangle Park office, IBM dispatched not only a public-relations official from that site but also another from Armonk, who had flown down for the occasion. &quot;They're still too bloated,&quot; contends David Hanna, a longtime IBM manager now working as a consultant.    Mr. Akers says people who make that argument aren't aware of an important number behind the numbers: the shift inside IBM from staff jobs to direct positions such as salesmen, programmers and factory workers. While the total work force will drop by 21,000 between 1986 and 1991, IBM will eliminate 50,000 of the jobs it terms &quot;indirect&quot; -- staffers, planners, secretaries, and the like.    While it seeks radical change within its walls, IBM is also transforming its attitude about the world outside.    &quot;If you go back a couple of years, we hardly spoke to anybody about anything,&quot; says William Grabe, the senior executive who set up the marketing plan for IBM's new AS/400 minicomputer, unveiled in June.    That's changing. The best example is the way IBM designed the AS/400, a landmark product. The company pinned high hopes on it, as a potential replacement for some 275,000 old IBM computers, in a market where Digital Equipment Corp. has been romping. As the minicomputer's early sales roar, it is shaping up inside IBM as a model for future product development.    As far back as the summer of 1987, IBM began talking to more than 1,300 outsiders about the product, then code-named &quot;Silverlake.&quot; It gave 700 customers access to early models, to make sure their old minicomputer software would run on it. It invited 51 customers, software developers and non-IBM salesmen inside IBM to pore over early blueprints. IBM showed them slides marked &quot;for your eyes only,&quot; urged them not to take notes and scooped up most handouts at the end of the session.    But the company's openness and eagerness for advice took many of the visitors aback. &quot;We all had a chance to get out a whip and beat them up a little bit,&quot; says Charlie Bell, the computer chief at Jefferson Smurfit Corp., a Missouri paper company.    He spent nearly two weeks, over three visits, at IBM's minicomputer plant in Rochester, Minn. And &quot;what they came out with met the majority of our requirements,&quot; he says.    IBM is also taking the once-unthinkable step of asking for sales help. Today non-IBMers sell more than 80% of IBM's personal computers and 60% of its minicomputers. IBMers accompany people from outside software companies on sales calls and let them set up shop in IBM buildings to show off their programs. IBMers point out features that will mesh with rivals' products. The company even offers planning services that could lead to the purchase of non-IBM products.    There is still plenty of reason to be cautious about the future of IBM, especially for anyone who hopes the company will recapture all its old glory. Mr. Akers says that IBM won't lose any market share in the current fourth quarter -- ending a three-year erosion. But part of the current earnings success clearly is due to the advent of new products. The new minicomputer is hot, and the company is riding the first flush of demand for some faster new mainframes and software.    Cultural changes or no, IBM's fortunes depend heavily on how many people buy mainframes. These big computers account for half of the company's revenue and two-thirds of profit. And IBM could face a mainframe challenge. It dominates the market only so long as it controls the crucial operating-system software, and an arbitration ruling expected soon in a dispute with Fujitsu could loosen that control.    The rise of the personal computer-hastened by IBM's blockbuster first PC six years ago -- has also changed the rules. Right now, IBM finds itself up against scores of smaller competitors whose collective clout is mightier than its own. And longer-term, there is the possibility that personal computers could take over most of the jobs currently performed by bigger -- and more profitable -- computers.    IBM always operated in the past with a dependable base of customers renting mainframe computers. It would have perhaps two-thirds of its revenue sewn up at the start of each year, from customers renewing their leases. IBM scrapped that cozy arrangement between the mid-70s and early '80s, in favor of selling to the former renters, because technology was changing so fast that it wanted them to carry more of the obsolescence risk. Mr. Akers is the first chief executive performing without this revenue safety net.    Earlier this year, Mr. Akers told IBM's employee magazine &quot;Think&quot; that he was shunning the limelight while the company struggled to recover. He would appear in public forums again, he said, &quot;only when people begin again to say, 'The IBM company's really rolling.'&quot;    Has that happened? Last week, Mr. Akers sat in his modest office overlooking an old Westchester County orchard and acknowledged that here he was, after all, talking to the public again. &quot;We kind of lost our way for a while,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think the pace of change has been quite rapid. And my level of impatience with the degree of change remains quite high.&quot;    ---    IBM (NYSE; Symbol: IBM)    Business: World's largest manufacturer of computers    Market value.................... $71.18 billion    Number of employees:     Dec. 31, 1987..................  389,348    Number of shareholders:     Dec. 31, 1987..................  787,988    Revenue (year ended Dec. 31):     1987........................... $54.22 billion     Change from 1986...............  +5.8%    Net income:     1987...........................  $5.26 billion     Change from 1986...............  +9.8%    Earnings per share:     1987...........................  $8.72     1988 forecast..................  $9.87    Latest quarter E.P.S.:     Sept. 30, 1988.................  $2.10     Sept. 30, 1987.................  $2.00    Price earning ratio.............  13.7     Computer industry average......  13.7    Indicated dividend yield........   3.7%     Computer industry average......   2.3%    Options traded on CBOE            What the Analysts Are Saying:   Although IBM's stock has burned lots of analysts over the past three years, many have warmed to the stock again.   &quot;IBM's momentum is turning up while most of the industry is turning down,&quot; says Steve Milunovich of Fist Boston.   Analysts say IBM is at the beginning of a product cycle for mainframes and minicomputers that should carry the company at least throufh the next several quarters. They also welcome signs that the company has stopped cutting prices so aggressively and has even raised them in some instances.   Some still worry that a recession could derail IBM or that growth could falter in Europe, the brightest spot for IBM for the past few years. Many analysts say that IBM still needs to cut more jobs, and some note that IBM is no longer benefiting from a declining dollar. Many worry because the computer has been treacherous territory for investors in recent months.   Still, Stephen Dube of Shearson Lehman Hutton says, &quot;This is the beginning of the beginning. The signs are beginning to develop that the turn is real.&quot;          Analysts' Ratings:      CURRENT   MO.
