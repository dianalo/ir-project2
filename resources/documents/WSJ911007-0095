Some people evenbelieve that ISO 9000 is a plot to keep us out of Europeafter 1992. While ISO 9000 is nothing so sinister, it can bea barrier to European entry unless clearly understood.   A set of five world-wide standards that establishrequirements for the management of quality, ISO 9000 is beingused by the 12-nation European Economic Community to providea universal framework for quality assurance. As tradebarriers are torn down by the European Community inpreparation for the 1992 economic unification, ISO 9000 hasbecome a tool to ensure cross-border quality. Progress hasbeen impressive. Estimates are that half of Europeanmanufacturing companies have received ISO 9000 certificationso far.</LP><TEXT>   This situation presents a challenge to U.S. business.Although there is no legal requirement that companies wishingto trade with Europe have ISO 9000 certification, it is clearthat if two suppliers are trying to land the same contract,the one with ISO 9000 certification has a substantialcompetitive edge.   The stakes are even higher than the European market,because ISO 9000 has applications beyond the EC. It has beenadopted by NATO and our own defense department. As a result,defense companies will be required to meet ISO 9000specifications. And the impact is snowballing as Americancompanies become certified. At Du Pont we have registeredover 55 separate businesses belonging to Du Pont.   Since these quality prerequisites are here to stay, thechallenge is to make them pay off -- to use ISO 9000 as thevehicle for implementing a basic quality program that canreduce costs and increase competitiveness.   For many businesses &quot;quality&quot; has been a vague conceptthat managers talk about but rarely come to terms with. ISO9000 takes the mystery out of quality. It defines qualitychapter by chapter, verse by verse, thereby providing aclearly defined path to set up a world-class qualityassurance system that is elemental in its logic andapplication.   It's also important to recognize the limits of ISO 9000.The standards do not apply to products. Instead, they provideassurance -- primarily through a system of internal andexternal audits -- that a certified company has a qualitysystem in place that will enable it to meet its publishedquality standards. Moreover, the ISO standards are generic;they apply to all industries from banking to resinmanufacturing.   ISO 9000 covers the same ground as Category 5, the qualityassurance section, of the Malcolm Baldrige Award. This is notto suggest that ISO is an award program, however. If qualityimprovement is a race without a finish line, ISO 9000 is thestarting point. Still, the process of qualifying for ISO 9000will improve organizations' quality systems.   A key characteristic of ISO 9000 certification is that itrequires third-party system registration. The third party inthis case is an authorized assessor or registrar who conductsan independent audit of an organization's quality system(usually costing between $5,000 and $10,000). If it passesthe audit, the system is registered and certified. Regularmaintenance audits are conducted to ensure that the systemdoesn't degrade.   Until recently there were no accredited U.S. registrars,so at Du Pont we've worked with such European firms as theBritish Standards Institute and Lloyds Register, which aregovernment-accredited in Britain. However, recently anaccreditor of U.S. registrars, the Registrar AccreditationBoard, was established. It is a subsidiary of the AmericanSociety for Quality Control. The creation of U.S. registrarsis an important step toward domesticating ISO 9000.   It is impossible to offer specific detail here about whatISO 9000 certification demands. In general, an audit requiresthat if all personnel involved in a given system werereplaced, the new people could continue making the product atthe same quality level as before.   For this to be the case, an organization seekingregistration must identify and document all the processes andelements that have an effect on quality (from managementresponsibility to training). It must also make sure theprocesses are functioning effectively according to thedictates determined by the company and ISO 9000. Thisrequires a process of internal auditing, management review,and the establishment of a quality system with definedprocedures, work instructions, and forms. This whole systemmust be exhaustively documented.   How difficult is this? It depends. If you've won aBaldrige award, registration of a business might take acouple of days. If you're a medium-sized manufacturer whosequality system is nonexistent or has atrophied, it might takeyou several months and several hundred thousand dollars tosatisfy an auditor and receive a certificate.   We at Du Pont believe this is a reasonable investment foran internationally certified quality system and a substantialcompetitive advantage that will last until your rivals arecertified.   ---   Ms. Hockman is a consultant at Du Pont's QualityManagement andamp; Technology Center, responsible for training andconsulting efforts in ISO 9000 certification.</TEXT></DOC>
