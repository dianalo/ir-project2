Over the past few years, dozens of companies havesprung up nationwide to sell the machines to auto repairshops, corporate maintenance departments and others thatservice cooling systems. Some of the companies also &quot;reclaim&quot;CFCs by purifying them for reuse.   Now the CFC recycling industry is expected to enter a boomperiod. One reason is a study reported last month showing CFClevels much higher than expected over the NorthernHemisphere. The chemicals got there partly by leaking fromcooling systems with faulty seals; in other cases, they'repurposely vented during servicing. CFCs deplete the earth'sozone layer, which blocks solar radiation that can cause skincancer and crop damage.   Soon CFC recyclers will get a bigger boost: Under thefederal Clean Air Act, venting CFCs from building airconditioners will be prohibited after July 1. This month, asimilar rule is expected to take effect for vehicles. The lawauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to fineviolators up to $25,000 a day.   &quot;Up to this point there's been no economic advantage torecycle&quot; CFCs, says Mamie Miller, the EPA's chief ofcompliance monitoring for air quality. But the prospect offines changes that.   Some companies already report growing interest. SeatonGras, president of Global Ozone Solutions, Nashua, N.H., saysinquiries about the company's CFC recycling machines havequadrupled over the past few months. At American Thermaflo, aSpringfield, Mass., company that sells CFC recycling systems,annual sales have risen to the &quot;tens of millions&quot; from themillions, says president Michael Fioretti.                                                                                                          Execs Get Little Sympathy   For Crimes Against Nature                                                                                                          EXECUTIVES differ with the general public on where thebuck stops when it comes to environmental crimes, accordingto a recent survey.   About 75% of the general public feels executives should beheld personally liable for their company's environmentaloffenses, but only 49% of 500 large-company executives whowere surveyed agree, says Arthur D. Little Inc., a Cambridge,Mass., consulting firm that conducted the poll.   The two groups also differ on the gravity of corporateenvironmental crimes. Though the public rates them as beingmuch more serious than corporate offenses such as pricefixing and insider trading, about 80% of executives saidprice fixing and insider trading are as serious asenvironmental crimes.   Still, the fact that even half of executives agree theyshould be held liable for environmental crimes &quot;suggests thatmany business leaders understand that they work under amicroscope and are increasingly accountable for their ownactions, or inactions,&quot; when it comes to the environment,says Stewart Young, an Arthur D. Little manager.                                                                                                          Canary Finds Work   Outside Coal Mine                                                                                                          SPOT or Puff could save your life by detectingenvironmental hazards early.   Using pets as early warning systems for household toxinsmakes sense for the same reason taking canaries into mineshas saved lives. The birds are acutely sensitive to toxinssuch as carbon monoxide, and keel over before people do.Similarly, dogs, cats and other pets -- due to their shorterlives and higher metabolisms than humans -- tend to showsickness faster than people do from exposure to asbestos,lead and other toxins, says Purdue University veterinaryresearcher Lawrence Glickman.   In one case, five cockateels died when a polymer-coatedfrying pan burned in the room in which they were caged, henotes. Soon after, the owner developed dizziness, nausea andother symptoms that were diagnosed as &quot;polymer fume fever.&quot;In another case, a veterinarian noticed a family's dogs hadhigh levels of lead in their blood, leading to the discoverythat the family's children suffered from lead poisoning.Children and dogs had both been eating paint chips.   Perhaps the most famous case occurred in the 1950s aroundMinimata Bay, Japan, where pet felines developed a nervousdisorder dubbed &quot;dancing cat&quot; disease. Many villagers laterdeveloped a similar disorder. It eventually was traced tomercury from a chemical plant that was ingested by the bay'sfish.   At Purdue, studies by Dr. Glickman and other scientistsindicate that occurrences of a rare lung cancer in dogs,mesothelioma, can give their owners early warning of asbestosrisks. The researchers also have found an increased risk ofcertain cancers in dogs among pet owners using herbicideswith the carcinogenic chemical 2,4-D.   Last year a National Research Council group led by Dr.Glickman recommended establishing a nationwide reportingsystem for information about animals and environmental healthhazards.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          TO UNDERSCORE the importance of preserving plant speciesaround the world, Pennsylvania State University researcherWilliam Lacy says only five crop plants now grown in the U.S.are thought to have originated here: sunflowers, blueberries,cranberries, pecans and Jerusalem artichokes. (Corn isbelieved to have roots in Central America.) . . . Universityof Maine researchers report a new recycling trick:pressure-cooking potato processors' peels to make ahigh-fiber flour. They say muffins made with the stuff are&quot;not unlike&quot; those from bakeries.</TEXT></DOC>
