Codd, a computer scientist who developed the relational model in thelate sixties while working for IBM, proposed that data should be stored intables that can be accessed through a single set of commands, regardless ofthe location of a given table.andP;  Like flat files and 1-2-3 worksheets, thesetables consist of rows and columns of data.andP;  Multiple tables in a relationaldatabase can be linked by their common fields: an inventory file, forexample, can be linked to an orders file by a common product number.andM;To manipulate database tables, Codd helped develop Structured Query Language,or SQL.andP;  SQL contains the commands needed to create, update, and maintainrelational database tables.andP;  Because there is only a single &quot;true&quot; SQL, anSQL program written for Paradox 3.5 should also work with IBM's DB2 mainframedatabase program or with Microsoft's SQL Server.andM;Buying DecisionsandM;If you want a database that's inexpensive, accessible, and effective, take alook at PC Magazine's July 26 issue, which compares six flat-file databases.andO;PC recommends Borland International's Reflex 2.0 and ButtonWare's PC-File5.0, blessing each with an Editor's Choice award.andP;  The review cited inparticular the &quot;features and values&quot; of the low-cost programs, which sell for$249.95 and $149.95, respectively.andM;Reflex can only enter one file at a time, but it compensates for thatlimitation by incorporating a full range of spreadsheet-like cross-tabulationfeatures and extensive reporting and graphing capabilities.andP;  With &quot;a full setof Lotus 1-2-3-style @functions&quot; for its crosstabs, queries, reports, andgraphics, Reflex is, says PC Magazine, &quot;the most exciting product of theflat-file databases.&quot;andM;PC-File, on the other hand, can make use of multiple database files, and itsbar and pie charts outshine those available in Reflex.andP;  PC-File can read andwrite dBase III data files, an accomplishment of no mean significance interms of compatibility.andP;  While Reflex can import and export dBase files also,you're forced to convert files at both ends of the process.andM;Government Computer News (GCN) agreed with PC's findings in its May 14Product Preference Survey, in which Reflex scored first in ease of use andwon &quot;a particularly strong score&quot; for its interface.andP;  PC-File fared less wellin the GCN study, ranking fourth out of seven overall, but took first placefor its &quot;value relative to price and ease of installation.&quot;andM;PC-File scored a fairly high 7.9 score in PC Week's May 14 issue, tying forsecond place in a field of six database programs.andP;  Echoing PC Magazine'sassessment that PC-File has &quot;superb multifile reporting facilities,&quot; PC Weekawarded the software the highest &quot;report generator&quot; rating in its study.andM;PC-File also boasted the lowest price of the PC Week review group ofso-called programmable databases.andP;  Though they don't have extensiveprogramming languages, these databases can all be &quot;programmed&quot; through menuselections to create custom screens, reports, and menus that insulate usersfrom the underlying database technology.andM;PC Week also cited Symantec's Qandamp;A as a strong performer in this category.andO;Qandamp;A includes features not available in other databases, such as an integratedword processor and a database-querying tool.andP;  While remaining a top contender(PC Magazine came close to giving it an Editor's Choice award), the consensusis that Qandamp;A is losing ground in the ease-of-use category.andP;  Symantec has takenheed: the program is reportedly going to be replaced with a more powerfulversion that boasts network support.andM;In the second category are more-expensive relational databases, which workwith multiple files and are fully programmable.andP;  You can create customapplications for people who know nothing about database technology by usingfull-blown programming languages and menu-selectable &quot;programming tools.&quot;andM;The top relational contenders are Borland International's Paradox 3.0,Ashton-Tate Corp.'s dBase IV version 1.1, and Microrim's Rbase 3.0.andP;  Not tobe overlooked is Clarion Software Corp.'s Clarion Professional Developer,which hasn't received quite as much attention from the press as the others,but it is nonetheless highly regarded among its users.andM;The Mighty Have FallenandM;Beset by bugs and reviled by all since its introduction almost two years ago,version IV of the once ubiquitous dBase made a mediocre showing across theboard.andP;  PC Week's August 20 Poll of Corporate Satisfaction put dBase IVversion 1.0 at the bottom of the list, and it wasn't alone--dBase IV wascalled &quot;all but unusable&quot; in InfoWorld's June 25 roundup.andM;Reviews of the newest version, 1.1, were beginning to appear at press timebut were primarily aimed at the flaws of the past.andP;  The question was not &quot;Howdoes it rate against the competition?&quot; but &quot;Does it work?&quot;andP;  An August 20review in InfoWorld gave 1.1 a clean bill of health but doubted that those&quot;who have moved on to other environments will find enough features to bringthem back.&quot;andM;Microrim's Rbase 3.0, released in April, initially receive ambivalent reviewsfrom the press, as well.andP;  Its SQL implementation and table-handlingtechniques outstrip those of the current competition, and its new interface,according to PC Week's April 30 review, moves the product closer to Paradox'sinteractive database and away from dBase's for-developers-only orientation.andM;These pluses were shadowed by bugs serious enough for InfoWorld to recommendwaiting for version 3.1, due by press time.andP;  Even so, Rbase's strengths aresubstantial enough that InfoWorld gave the program its highest rating in itsJune 25 comparison of five relational databases.andP;  PC Magazine also gave Rbase3.0 a good recommendation for both developers and end users, giving asreasons its improved interface, SQL compatibility, and potent database accessmethods.andP;  Rbase 3.0, by all accounts, is coming closer than ever to Paradox3.0 in terms of its new features and improved usability.andM;The dark horse in the database race is Clarion.andP;  In PC Week's August 20Corporate Poll, Clarion topped the list of nine relational databases.andO;Clarion, which incorporates an extensive programming language, anapplications generator, screen- and menu-building tools, and lots of otherfeatures, garnered more than half of the top ratings in the 13 features thatwere cited as important by PC Week readers.andP;  Primary among those strengths isits capability as a programming environment.andM;Though its younger sibling, Clarion Personal Developer, may be moreappropriate for database novices, both share the general philosophy thatscreens, reports, and databases should be easy to create, update, andmaintain.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
