The reason for Daimler-Benz's reluctance is that it has enough problems of its own, without absorbing those of aerospace group MBB, through which West Germany owns 37.9% of Airbus Industrie, the money-draining European airline consortium.    Bonn has been trying for a year to persuade Daimler-Benz to absorb MBB. Under the government's latest proposal, Daimler-Benz reportedly would take a 30% stake and managerial control of MBB and its loss-making Airbus subsidiary. The government also wants to restructure West Germany's disjointed aerospace industry under Daimler-Benz.    The Economics Ministry apparently wants to sweeten its proposal by extending Daimler-Benz a federal guarantee of as much as four billion marks ($2.28 billion) on future currency risks. The offer, reported last week in the Financial Times of London, hasn't been confirmed by the government. It is designed to satisfy Daimler-Benz's reservations about potential foreign-exchange losses from Airbus sales, which are denominated in dollars. Late last year, the government said it would bankroll 4.9 billion marks of the costs to develop the new Airbus A330-A340 series through 1996, addressing another of Daimler-Benz's main concerns about Airbus-related costs.    Bonn's continued assurances of subsidies and risk guarantees come despite potential for criticism from the U.S., which frowns on Europe's heavy subsidization of its commercial aircraft industry.    Despite the assurances, Daimler-Benz remains unswayed. Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz's chairman, has expressed interest in some MBB operations only if Airbus is excluded.    &quot;We have always said that finding another solution for the liabilities of the Airbus undertaking was a premise for our taking an interest in MBB,&quot; Mr. Reuter said at a news conference in Stuttgart last week. &quot;But we are still waiting for the messenger from Bonn.&quot; A Daimler-Benz spokesman added later that &quot;there has been no movement toward an agreement in which we would become involved in MBB or Airbus.&quot;    An official government offer mightn't come for awhile. The additional cost guarantees are still being debated within the governing coalition itself, where the Economics Ministry's latest Airbus initiatives have run into the reservations of Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg.    Analysts suggest Daimler-Benz has priorities other than acquiring MBB, which produces aerospace and defense products and had 1987 sales of 6.2 billion marks.    &quot;Daimler-Benz still has enough trouble with the units they have without having to take on the added risk of MBB and Airbus, even with some cost guarantees,&quot; said Thomas Miskel, an auto analyst for CRM Securities G.m.b.H. &quot;The whole aerospace industry has become a bottomless pit and the government's assurances apparently are not attractive enough for them.&quot;    Daimler-Benz became West Germany's largest company with 67.5 billion marks in 1987 sales after acquiring major technology companies starting in 1984. These included electronics group AEG AG, and Dornier G.m.b.H., an aerospace concern. But efforts to integrate the units have been slow, generating doubts about Mr. Reuter's strategy of achieving technological &quot;synergy&quot; within the expanded group.    Moreover, the company's Mercedes-Benz cars have lost some of their luster, faced with challenges in the luxury car market from rivals such as Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. Daimler-Benz plans to reduce production in its automotive business by 25,000 passenger cars this year.    There has been labor unrest in its South African truck plant, just as Daimler-Benz's overall truck operations were just showing signs of restored profitability. Daimler-Benz has had headaches with Dornier, considered too small to compete alone in aircraft markets. Some analysts suggest that merging MBB and Dornier ultimately could solve those problems.    If Daimler-Benz eventually does agree to taking over MBB, it would become West Germany's largest defense contractor. And with sales then totaling roughly 74 billion marks, the Daimler-Benz group would account for nearly 4% of West Germany's gross national product. </TEXT></DOC>
