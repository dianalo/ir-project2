Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, while saying he continues to seek the hostages' release, denied an agreement is in the works.    The speculation follows a judge's surprise decision last week to free Mohammad Mouhajer, a Frenchman of Lebanese origin charged last year with violating French firearms-control laws and associating with terrorists. Mr. Mouhajer wasn't accused of terrorist acts but of having links to those who committed a series of bombings that killed 13 people and wounded more than 250 others here in 1985 and 1986.    A hostage release would provide a boost to the presidential candidacy of the Gaullist prime minister, who polls say is running second to Socialist incumbent Francois Mitterrand. Mr. Chirac controls day-to-day government in &quot;cohabitation&quot; with Mr. Mitterrand.    Socialist leaders questioned the release. Former Socialist Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said it occurred in &quot;strange, thought-provoking conditions.&quot; But Mr. Chirac noted in a television interview that Mr. Mouhajer's release was the act of a judge, and &quot;is linked . . . neither directly nor indirectly with the problem of French or foreign hostages held in Lebanon.&quot;    The incident recalled a November agreement in which terrorists in Lebanon released two French hostages and France allowed an Iranian interpreter accused of links to those involved in the Paris bombings to return to Iran. </TEXT></DOC>
