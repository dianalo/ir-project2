Radiation-induced attenuationand subsequent recovery were measured over a wide range of transmittedoptical power levels. These measurements were performed at a wavelengthof 850 nm and a temperature of -55 C using the NATO/FOTP-49 test procedures.When low levels of optical power were used, the maximum attenuation increasedby a factor of 10 and the recovery time increased by a factor of 30 comparedwith results at high optical power. Complete recovery required severalhours at the lowest optical powers. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
