The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the maingrade of U.S. crude oil, tumbled $1.12 to close at $22.55 per42-gallon barrel after trading in a $2 range during the session.   Analysts said concern about a possible surplus of crude oilprompted a late selling spree on the final day before the Februarycontract expired at the close of trading.   Other contract months posted smaller losses. The March contractfell 31 cents to $21.77 a barrel and April fell 22 cents to $21.15.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, No. 2 heating oilfor February delivery fell 2.67 cents to 60.99 cents a gallon aftertrading in a wide range. The contract closed last week with a0.94-cent gain after five rocky sessions.   The March heating oil contract lost 1.68 cents to settle at58.00 cents a gallon while April ended down 1.32 cents at 55.50cents.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for February delivery declined 0.98cent to 60.64 cents a gallon, March lost 1.37 cents to 61.32 centsand April slipped 1.49 cents to 61.94 cents a gallon.   ``The focus was on the crude contract expiration,'' said LindaSimard, energy analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``Peopleheard there were plenty of sweet cargos available and crude fellout.''   Buyers drove crude prices up late last week amid concern aboutpossible tight supplies of light, sweet crude, which is sought byrefiners to make gasoline.   Heating oil's decline Monday despite the return of winteryweather to many parts of the nation surprised some analysts.Heating oil prices hit record levels in December as cold weatherdrove up demand.   However, industry statistics last week suggested thatinventories were climbing faster than many expected as imported oilordered during the cold weather replaced depleted supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
