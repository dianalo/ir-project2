(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker and a former PTLboard member disagreed Wednesday in bankruptcy court over who setthe evangelist's high salary, with Bakker saying the board approvedit and the director saying the board never acted on the matter.   The dismissed TV preacher was called to the stand by attorneysfor PTL, which is trying to win a $52 million claim against Bakker,his wife, Tammy, and former top aide David Taggart.   PTL attorneys want the Bakkers and Taggart to repay money theysay was lost through mismanagement of PTL accounts and unjustifiedcompensation and benefits. The trial began Monday before U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.   The ministry has been trying to reorganize in bankruptcy courtsince June 1987, three months after Bakker left the ministry amid asex and money scandal involving former church secretary JessicaHahn. The ministry's debts total more than $130 million.   Asked by PTL attorney Brad Leggett who decided his 1984 salaryof $228,000, Bakker replied that it was set by the board ofdirectors.   ``I have been with Heritage Village Ministries with 15 years andthe board began my salary then and any raises would have been votedup from that point,'' he said.   However, earlier Wednesday, Charles H. Cookman, districtsuperintendent for the Assemblies of God Ministries' North Carolinaarea and a member of the PTL board from 1980 to 1987, testifiedthat the board of directors ``never ruled on salaries. I don't knowwho set the salaries.''   Bakker has been trying to regain control of the evangelicalempire, which includes the PTL television network and the HeritageUSA Christian resort.   On Wednesday, Bakker attorney Jim Toms said outside court thatBakker still is interested in buying back PTL, despite therejection of his offer last week when he failed to prove he had themoney to back his $172 million bid.   Toms added, however, ``We're not going to talk about anyfinancing until we get some money, until we hear a faint rustle.''   Reynolds has ordered bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton Jr.to find a buyer for the ministry. On Monday, he filed a report withReynolds saying that he cannot recommend a buyer now. He askedReynolds to allow him until Sept. 27 to file a motion for sale,either to a private buyer or at auction.   In his testimony, Cookman said board meetings were run primarilyby Bakker, with help from the former executive vice president,Richard Dortch.   Cookman said it was not until March 1987, when Bakker resigned,that he became aware of the ministry's troubles. ``I wasastonished,'' he said, to learn the extent of bonuses given toBakker and other executives.   When he first joined the board, Cookman said, he understoodBakker's salary to be between $35,000 and $40,000 a year. ``In1986, I asked Richard Dortch what Bakker's salary was, and myrecollection of his reply was $200,000.''   He testified that in one meeting the issue of compensation forTaggart was raised, but board members were told, ``That comes underthe administration of PTL, and is not a board matter.''   Also Wednesday, an IRS auditor testified that because of a lackof documentation at PTL, he could only assume that some expensescharged to the ministry by the Bakkers and their top aides were forpersonal use.   Larry Howlett, a Nashville, Tenn.-based auditor of tax-exemptorganizations, testified Tuesday he could find no paperwork toprove a legitimate business purpose for expenditures including apersonal 300-foot water slide at the Bakkers' Tega Cay home on LakeWylie, two Rolls Royce automobiles and hundreds of thousands ofdollars Bakker and others got through PTL accounts.   Under cross-examination Wednesday by Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis,Howlett conceded, however, that because of the lack ofdocumentation, he could only assume the Bakkers and Taggart wereusing the cars and other expenditures for no legitimate businesspurpose.   Reynolds also must act on a motion filed by Fairfax Savings andLoan Corp. of Baltimore, a major PTL creditor, to shut down theministry and auction off its assets.   The bank accused Benton of misleading creditors and the courtabout the seriousness of PTL's situation.   In the motion filed last week, Fairfax, which holds PTLmortgages totaling $12 million, criticized Benton for failing tofind a buyer for PTL's assets.</TEXT></DOC>
