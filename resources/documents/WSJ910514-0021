The Environmental Protection Agency has been mullingwhether to ban the bug and worm killer since 1989. In recentmonths, some states such as Maryland and Virginia acted ontheir own to toughen restrictions on the use of Furadan.</LP><TEXT>   An FMC spokesman said the move won't have a materialeffect on the company's earnings, and added that theChicago-based company plans to continue expanding sales ofFuradan overseas.   FMC didn't disclose the size of its Furadan sales but saidit represents 6% of its total agricultural chemicalsbusiness. The company said it will also continue to sell aliquid form of Furadan.   Furadan is primarily used by farmers to kill insects andworms in fields of corn and sorghum. Birds apparently confusethe granules of Furadan lying in the field for grit, andpoison themselves.   Instead of banning the insecticide, the EPA has agreed tolet FMC reduce its sales of granular Furadan over severalyears. Beginning this fall, FMC will withdraw the insecticidefrom 10 states such as Florida and from coastal counties inNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon and Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
