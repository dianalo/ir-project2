SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Communist Party leader Gen. WojciechJaruzelski said today he does not intend to run for president, andhe endorsed Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for the post,state television announced.   Jaruzelski made the announcement to a meeting of the party'sCentral Committee, the report said. The meeting was to consider theparty's nominee for president. There had been indications someoneother than Jaruzelski would be chosen.   As the meeting continued, anti-Jaruzelski demonstrators marchedin Warsaw's streets, hurling stones and Molotov cocktails at policewho responded with water cannons.   ``I know well that public opinion associates me more often withmartial law and less often with the line of reforms _ with those sosignificant decisions of the 10th plenum. I must take intoconsideration social reality,'' Jaruzelski said.   During the 10th plenum, in January, communist officials agreed inprinciple to restore legal status to Solidarity, which had beenoutlawed after the 1981 martial law crackdown.   Jaruzelski said in an interview with The Associated Press onWednesday that he might not accept the presidency without support ofthe Solidarity-led opposition.   Solidarity-backed lawmakers in the National Assembly, which willmeet next week to elect a president, said they would vote againstJaruzelski.   Earlier, as the 230-member Central Committee convened, aspokesman at the party's press office who asked not to be identifiedsaid there was ``hearsay'' that Kiszczak would be nominated. But headded: ``It is unofficial.''   Kiszczak, a Jaruzelski loyalist, is a 63-year-old army generalwho heads Poland's police apparatus and helped wage the government'swar against Solidarity for most of the 1980s.   Despite that, he won the confidence of the Solidarity leadershipduring negotiations that began last August during a national wave ofstrikes.   Like Jaruzelski, he threatened to step down during the Januaryplenum unless Solidarity's legal status was reinstated.   He also led officials in negotiations with the opposition, whichended in April with Solidarity being legalized. Thetalks alsocleared the way for elections earlier this month _ the country'sfreest since World War II.   In his statement, Jaruzelski described Kiszczak as ``the soldier,politician, patriot and a man who has been close to me for manyyears.''   ``In the eyes of the society, including also opposition circles,he is rightly considered as a leading representative of the line ofreconciliation.''   Jaruzelski's name had been linked to the presidency since theoffice was created as a result of the April agreement, but hehimself stressed Wednesday the need for someone who could have ``atleast a minimum of support'' from both sides.   The president is to be the guarantor of the state, responsiblefor the armed forces and for Poland's foreign alliances. Thepresident, who may serve two six-year terms, may also dissolveParliament in limited circumstances and declare one 90-day state ofemergency.   On Thursday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said: ``There are morecandidates for president than we think, and there are manycandidates on which both sides will agree.''   Solidarity deputies and senators are to meet in Warsaw onSaturday to debate the union's stance on the presidency. Solidarityis not expected to put up its own candidate.   Candidates backed by the labor union won 99 of 100 seats in thenewly created Senate and all 161 seats open to the opposition in the460-member Sejm during voting in June. The remaining Sejm seats werereserved for the communists and their allies, who control thelegislature.   In the interview Wednesday, Jaruzelski said he is open to moredemocratic reforms as long as they benefit society.   He also said the Communist Party will not return to its monopolyrule of the past.   ``We have become convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthything, not only in the economy, but also in political life,'' hesaid.   Wearing his familiar dark glasses and a traditional businesssuit, Jaruzelski declared that his party's automatic leading role inPoland ``already is history.''   Asked how far democratization could go, he said, in a writtenanswer: ``The limits of the reforms are not rigid. The main issue istheir social purpose and effectiveness.''   He said the economic and social changes have already put Polandin the forefront of reforms in the East bloc.   Asked about the whether he would be a presidential candidate,Jaruzelski said that would depend on ``democratic'' consultationswithin the party and added, ``I will also seriously consider thestand of the opposition, understanding that the president,especially in our conditions when we have to unite the nation'sefforts and build platforms of accord, should have at least aminimum of support'' from all sides.   ``I am a soldier, so I have a deep-rooted feeling of duty _ butalso of honor. I will not crawl to this post.''   Jaruzelski said the communists fared poorly in the June 4 andJune 18 elections because voters have not yet realized how much theparty platform has changed in favor of democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
