(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Contributions to the Rev. Jerry Falwell's``Old-Time Gospel Hour'' have dropped by more than $10 million andthe ministry's net worth has fallen by nearly $5 million from lastyear, a newspaper reported Wednesday.   Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Falwell, said the organization isdeliberately moving away from dependence on direct publiccontributions and said revenues have increased almost $3 million.   The Lynchburg News andamp; Daily Advance, citing the latest availabletax records, reported that for the fiscal year ending June 30,public contributions to the Old-Time Gospel Hour totaled $40.7million, the lowest level since the 1981-82 fiscal year.   ``We have made a conscious effort in the past year to look forother sources of income, realizing that contributions can and willdrop depending on climate of the country,'' DeMoss said.   Combined with indirect public support, which DeMoss said includeddeferred giving, estate planning and grants, total contributionswere $44.2 million, comparable with 1985-86 levels. The ministry'stotal revenues increased from $60.9 million in 1986-87 to $63.7million in 1987-88, he said.   ``While contributions may drop in a given year, we feel like wecan maintain a pretty stable bottom line, which we're most concernedwith,'' DeMoss said. ``The key thing is that even though directpublic support dropped by as much as $10 million, total revenues areup. As far as we're concerned and as far as any business or companywould be concerned, the bottom line is the bottom line. And that'sencouraging.''   DeMoss said separate sex scandals involving former PTL leader JimBakker and television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart may have contributedto the decline in contributions.   ``I think we'd be a lot more concerned about a bottom line dropof $10 million than we are about a difference in contributions,'' hesaid. ``We are prepared and preparing for the possibility thatcontributions may be harder to come by year after year and we needother income sources.''   The newspaper said records also show Falwell, as president of thetelevised Gospel Hour, received a $25,000 raise, bringing his annualsalary to $125,000. He also continued to receive $33,000 in benefitsfrom the ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
