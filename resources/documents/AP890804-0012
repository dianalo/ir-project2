We too will help solve the problems there, so thepeople of the region can live in peace and harmony,'' he said inthe broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudentsolutions,'' Rafsanjani said.   However, Rafsanjani also said the United States must take theinitiative by pressuring Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, aShiite Moslem cleric it kidnapped from south Lebanon a week ago.   If the U.S. responds by saying it cannot do so, ``this isn'tacceptable to us,'' he said.   Israel has offered to swap Obeid for the 16 foreign hostages inIran and three Israeli soldiers held there.   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, of which Obeid is reputed to bea member, rejected such a swap. Hezbollah is believed to be theumbrella for factions holding most of the foreign hostages.   On Thursday, one of those factions, the Revolutionary JusticeOrganization, suspended a threat to kill American hostage JosephCicippio but demanded that Israel free Obeid and Palestinian andLebanese prisoners it holds. It did not say what would happen ifIsrael refused.   On Monday, another faction, the Organization of the Oppressed onEarth, claimed it killed American hostage William Higgins, a Marinelieutenant colonel, in retaliation for Israel's refusal to freeObeid.   ``We do not make any judgment about the group which executed theAmerican colonel,'' Rafsanjani said.   ``You cannot condemn the innocent people of Lebanon ... on thevague basis that some group has possibly killed someone (Higgins)for a crime,'' he added.   Higgins' captors accused him of being a spy.   Rafsanjani, known as a pragmatist who wants to improve Iran'sties with the West, has not said whether Iran played a role in thereprieve granted Cicippio. A knowledgeable Shiite Moslem source inBeirut, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the final word onCicippio's reprieve came from him.   The 54-year-old Rafsanjani is believed to want to end theinternational terrorist image Iran developed under the leadershipof the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   After Khomeini's death June 3, Rafsanjani moved quickly to gainthe upper hand against a radical faction headed by InteriorMinister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi. The radicals favor Khomeini'santi-Western views and backing of terrorist groups abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
