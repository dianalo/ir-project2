<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-1149 </DOCNO><TEXT>Most difficult conditions of strata control occur in the case when thedirections of work advance and the zone of increased rock pressure areat right angles; most endangered are the segments at the entrance toand exit from these zones. Measures taken until now for stabilizationof side walls have not been effective. Displacement of side walls inthese zones is 1.2-2 times higher than elsewhere. In the Central Donbassregion wooden props are used for support close to working faces. Mechanicalproperties of wooden props have been investigated by VNIMI. Recommendationsconcerning stowing and support methods are detailed, depending on sidewallclass and on the zone of hazard. When the front line of the zone of elevatedpressure coincides with the working face line, the best way is to increasethe angle of intersection by 15-20 degrees and to traverse this zonein a step by step manner. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
