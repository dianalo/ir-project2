MoserandM;IBM is actively trying to set an independent standard for its REXX procedurallanguage in an attempt to position it as the most widely used macro languageon PCs, according to industry observers.andM;REXX, which is IBM's standard procedural language for its Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA), was recently approved for consideration as an ANSIstandard language.andP;  In January, a committee will convene to begin the processof hammering out a potential REXX standard.andM;&quot;It helps to have a standard that is not completely owned by IBM -- anindependent standard so that developers can figure out if they have a validimplementation of the language,&quot; according to Kevin Kearney, president of theMansfield Software Group Inc., the Storrs, Conn., maker of Personal REXX, aPC version of the language.andM;Designed as a macro language that can directly communicate with the operatingsystem, REXX has steadily grown in popularity and is now available on avariety of PC, minicomputer and mainframe platforms.andM;An example of the language's growth is that it is now included with IBM'sOS/2 Extended Edition and Standard Edition 1.3.andM;While still not in widespread use on PCs, corporate programmers say REXX iseasy to read and a less complicated language to learn than its principalrival -- BASIC.andM;&quot;BASIC has grown and evolved over time, but it carries a lot of historicbaggage that makes it harder to use and a little more obscure,&quot; said RobertO'Hara, a systems architect for Lotus Development Corp. in Cambridge, Mass.andM;&quot;REXX is a general-purpose programming language that developers can use whenthey don't want to take the time and effort to write in C and they need toput together a program far more quickly,&quot; added O'Hara.andM;While REXX will certainly profit from standardization, there's not a greatdeal of diversity among its various flavors, said Charles Daney, president ofQuercus Systems, a developer of communication software in Saratoga, Calif.andM;&quot;There's about 98 percent compatibility between most implementations, and weare trying to see that it continues at this level,&quot; he said.andM;While REXX is on its way to becoming an ANSI standard, the three-stageprocess is extremely involved and will probably take at least a year.andM;With phase one complete, the next step is to draft a proposal detailing thespecifics of the standard that will be eventually submitted to the ANSIcommittee.andM;Next, the draft proposal will be scrutinized until a consensus opinion isreached, explained Jean Paul Emard, director of X3 Secretariat, theWashington D.C.-based ANSI-accredited overseer of the standards committee.andM;The entire process will result in a set of guidelines for the language thatwill ensure portability and execution on a variety of platforms, promotereliability, and ensure that the language can be maintained.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
