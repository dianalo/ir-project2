WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 48 million people cast ballots forGeorge Bush for president six weeks ago, but the 538 who reallymatter will vote Monday.   That's when the Electoral College meets in an antiquated and muchmaligned constitutional ritual that has survived for two centuries.   Expect no surprise here. Bush should defeat Democrat MichaelDukakis by 426 votes to 112 votes _ give or take a ``faithlesselector.''   In state capitals around the nation on Monday, the electors willmeet to cast their votes and sign half a dozen documents swearingthey've done their duty.   This sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint session ofCongress on Jan. 4, when Vice President George Bush, as president ofthe Senate, will open the ballots and anounce the results _ andformally declare himself the president-elect.   The political parties in each state pick prospective electors _one for each congressman and senator the state has.   While voters on Nov. 8 may have thought they were voting for oneof the presidential candidates, they really were casting theirballots for the Republican or Democratic slate of electors in theirstate. The party that wins a state sends its electors to the meetingset by law for Monday.   Among those who have the honor and duty are some of the vicepresident's relatives: son Neil Bush, in Colorado and brotherPrescott S. Bush Jr. in Connecticut.   ``I think it was a nice honor, to get to cast a vote for mydad,'' Neil Bush, a Denver oilman, said. ``It'll be nice to be asmall footnote in history.''   Among others with the duty are Bush's designated White Housechief of staff, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. Penn State footballcoach Joe Paterno, who seconded Bush's nomination at the RepublicanNational Convention, is a Pennsylvania elector. But most are stateparty workers or insiders rewarded for their labors, and stateofficeholders, such as California Gov. George Deukmejian and AlabamaGov. Guy Hunt.   In the 10 states and the District of Columbia that were carriedby Michael Dukakis, Democratic electors will vote.   Electors are expected to vote for their party's presidentialnominee and vice presidential nominee. But in this unique Americansystem, they don't have to _ and therein lies the potential formischief or intrigue.   In nearly 200 years, eight electors have broken their pledge andvoted for someone else.   The lure of making some dramatic point, and gaining widespread iffleeting notice, endures. A Minnesota elector, Bill Davis, treasurerof the state Democratic-Farm-Labor Party, has said he may cast asymbolic vote for Jesse Jackson for vice president instead ofDemocratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the party's nominee.   And this year, with the furor over Dan Quayle's selection asBush's Republican vice presidential running mate still fresh inmemory, some electors have been getting letters urging them to``Dump Quayle'' and cast vice presidential ballots for someone else.   ``Dan Quayle does not have to be the next vice president. Justask the framers of the Constitution, who devised the ElectoralCollege precisely to deal with the current predicament,'' lawjournalist David A. Kaplan and New York lawyer Gary S. Simon wrotein a New York Times opinion-page article last month.   Such a case for rests on the argument that the founding fathersenvisioned the electors as truly deliberative. Of course, thefounding fathers didn't know about the emergence of the two dominantparties, or a nation attuned to instantaneous communication, whenthey added the provision during the constitutional convention of1787 in Philadelphia. They saw it as an elite group of wise men tobe trusted with the decision.   In fact, about half the states now have laws rquiring theelectors to vote as pledged. But experts say the laws might not passa constitutional test and may be unenforceable.   In the past, some have proposed scrapping the entire ElectoralCollege system and provide for direct election. A middle-groundproposal is to keep the electoral system but do away with electors _that is, award electoral votes automatically.   But all efforts to make such changes have fallen short inCongress. The last serious effort was in 1979, when the change won amajority in the Senate but fell well short of the two-thirds neededfor a consitutional amendment.   The move was opposed by a conservatives, by small states thatfeared they would be overlooked in campaigns without electoralvotes, and some black leaders and other minorities who sharedsimilar concerns.   Former Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana _ who was unseated in 1980 byQuayle _ sponsored the change. He argued that the system isundemocratic because it poses the potential for a candidate to beelected without winning the popular vote.   That has happened: John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayesin 1876, and Benjamin Harrison in 1888.   But don't look for it from the electors of 1988.   ``They're going to do their duty, as the people instructed,''said Republican National Committee press secretary Albert Maruggi.</TEXT></DOC>
