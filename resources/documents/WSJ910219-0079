The company agreed to pay a record $10 million fine, thelargest civil penalty the Justice Department's antitrustdivision has ever levied against one defendant, and the firstfine under the 1982 consent order that broke up AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Although the Bells don't predict amajor setback, the penalty is certain to fuel opponents'arguments that greater freedom would encourage moreanticompetitive behavior.</LP><TEXT>   The record fine, which U S West said it will take as acharge to first-quarter earnings, comes as the JusticeDepartment is stepping up preparations for Nynex Corp.'scriminal trial later this year. Nynex was charged last yearwith violating the information-services ban. At the sametime, all of the Bells have been asking Congress to lift theconsent-decree restrictions.   U S West, one of seven regional telephone companies,admitted violating provisions of the decree that bar theseven Baby Bells from anticompetitive behavior, from offeringinformation services and from manufacturing long-distanceequipment. The company said the violations were inadvertentand agreed to beef up its procedures to comply with thebreakup decree. The Justice Department, which has argued foreasing restrictions on the Bells, has generally been lenientin enforcing the decree.   According to documents filed with federal district JudgeHarold Greene, who oversees the Bell breakup decree and whoapproved the U S West-Justice Department agreement, U S Westadmitted to engaging in discriminatory pricing. The Baby Belloffered the General Services Administration, the federalgovernment's purchasing arm, a lower price for access to itslocal network if the GSA bought U S West switching servicesinstead of ATandamp;T's switching services. That investigationbegan in 1986, as the GSA was preparing to improve thegovernment's long-distance telephone network under amultibillion-dollar contract known as FTS-2000.   The Denver-based company also admitted to providing avariety of &quot;reverse directory&quot; services, including givingcustomers the names and addresses of phone subscribers basedon a telephone number or name. The services violated thebreakup decree's prohibition against offering informationservices.   In another violation of the information-servicesrestriction, U S West failed to halt the provision ofinformation services by Applied Communications Inc. after itacquired the company. Applied Communications had beensupplying Atlantic Richfield Co. with computer-facilitiesmanagement services, including hardware and personnel to runArco's debit card system.   The fourth violation involved the breakup decree's ban onthe Bells manufacturing telecommunications equipment. U SWest's Knowledge Engineering Inc. unit designed, developedand sold to phone companies operator workstations used bydirectory-assistance and call-assistance operators. All ofthe violations have stopped, the government said.   As part of the agreement, the Justice Department droppedinquiries into nine other U S West activities, includingproviding certain services to GSA, an opinion-pollingservice, talking yellow pages services, pay-phone salespractices, and its One-Call service that notifiedconstruction companies and others about the location ofunderground cables. The One-Call service was the subject of a1989 consent decree, and the company had stopped the otheractivities as well. U S West denied that the activitiesviolated the decree.   A government memorandum filed with the court contained astrong warning to the company, saying that if U S Westviolates the decree again, &quot;its admitted history ofnoncompliance will provide a substantial basis&quot; for findingthe company in criminal contempt of the decree. The JusticeDepartment said part of the problem arose from the attitudeof U S West top management toward the decree. More than anyother Baby Bell, U S West &quot;took a public and private stancein opposing the decree,&quot; it said. But the department cited a&quot;new tone&quot; set by the company's new chairman, Richard D.McCormick.   Ronald Stowe, head of the Baby Bell coalition lobbyingagainst the consent decree and head of Pacific TelesisGroup's Washington office, said the violations were&quot;regrettable,&quot; but clearly an exception to common businesspractices. He acknowledged that the fine gives opponents&quot;more arguments and ammunition,&quot; but said it doesn't changethe substance of the Bells' public policy goals.   That view wasn't shared by those opposed to granting theBells more freedom. &quot;The growing record of post-divestituremisconduct by the Bell companies ought to make Congress thinkcarefully before it changes the consent decree,&quot; said JamesL. Casserly, a Washington lawyer with Squire, Sanders andamp;Dempsey, who represents equipment makers.   Wall Street took the announcement in stride. U S Weststock rose 62.5 cents a share to close at $40.375 incomposite New York Stock Exchange trading. &quot;All this shows isthat it is virtually impossible not to violate the consentdecree,&quot; said Jack Grubman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst.</TEXT></DOC>
