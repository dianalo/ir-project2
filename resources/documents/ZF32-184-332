Department of Defense.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IMA Issues Media Portability StandardandM;SAN JOSE, Calif.andP;  -- An industry group has pushed forward a standard thatwill let all interactive training programs work on any brand of videotraining hardware in the Defense Department.andM;In October the Interactive Multimedia Association issued a document called&quot;Recommended Practices for Multimedia Portability,&quot; which last month became arequired standard for the Defense Department.andM;DOD incorporated the association's standard in Military Standard 1379,Appendix D, in November, IMA president Richard Thackray said in an interviewat the CD-ROM and Multimedia Conference late last month.andP;  DOD then issued aninstruction last month requiring that all interactive multimedia coursewareand hardware systems bought comply with the standard.andM;Thackray said the National Institute of Standards and Technology hasconsulted with IMA, which has offices in Washington, and DOD to ensure anopen, fair standards process.andM;&quot;The IMA open systems approach is important for reducing user risks in makinginvestments in multimedia,&quot; said Allen L. Hankinson, chief of the Systems andSoftware Technology Division at NIST.andM;The standard will let CD-ROM disks and their interactive courses move freelybetween systems of different vendors if the disks are the same size, saidThackray.andP;  He said if the course programming is on a different medium thanthe one for the target system, simply moving the data from one format toanother will let the program run, without any recoding.andM;Philip V.W.andP;  Dodds, IMA compatibility project leader, said, &quot;The industry isstepping up and recognizing the importance of cross-platform compatibility.&quot;andM;Dodds said Navy officials became perturbed when an interactive video trainingcourse to teach surgeons how to treat injured Marines in a Middle East desertwar was sent to the Persian Gulf.andP;  It was incompatible with the equipmentinstalled on the ships, and thus proved useless when needed most.andM;DOD officials have decided this will not remain a problem, Dodds said.andP;  Hesaid the instruction requiring the new standard mandates rewriting of codeand generation of device drivers to update existing programs and systems.andM;Systems for which updates would be too expensive must get phased out underthe DOD directive, he said.andM;Dodds said NIST officials are contemplating a Federal Information ProcessingStandard for multimedia, but it might not be mandatory.andM;&quot;We are most interested in working with the IMA to accelerate the developmentof specifications that will result in multimedia applications that can beused in open systems,&quot; said NIST's Hankinson.andM;The IMA has more than 180 organizations as members, including IBM Corp., SonyCorp., the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ATandamp;T Co., the Air Force, New YorkUniversity and Apple Computer Inc.andM;It brought Microsoft Corp. into the fold last month.andM;Microsoft has begun touting a standard extension to Windows and MS-DOS calledMultimedia PC (MPC).andP;  The MPC standard is meant to set requirements forachieving quality sound, animation and near-photographic video on otherwisestandard microcomputers.andM;It requires a 286, 386 or 486 micro, a sound board, a CD-ROM drive, VGA orbetter video and multimedia extensions to Windows.andM;Microsoft Chairman William H. Gates said at the conference he wants to turnthe MPC standard and trademark over to an open industry standards group.andP;  Hesaid he sees Microsoft as the temporary custodian of the standard.andM;IMA's Thackray said his organization is interested in becoming the keeper ofMPC and incorporating it eventually as a parallel part of IMA's multimediaportability standard.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
