Dravo said it owns two asphalt plants and an aggregates distribution facility in Houston, but doesn't have a quarry to provide its own source of aggregates. Because the company was unable to buy a quarry, Dravo decided to leave the Houston market, a spokesman said.    The sale is expected to be completed in September, Dravo said. It isn't likely to have a material effect on earnings, the company said.    Dravo is a natural resources concern whose principal operations include construction aggregates and lime. </TEXT></DOC>
