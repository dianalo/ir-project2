Speculation is growing that the economy is slowing down markedly and that inflation pressures are fading fast. The Commerce Department said yesterday its index of leading economic indicators fell in December for the third month in a row.    &quot;Taken together with all the other economic information we've gotten lately, this suggests there is much underlying weakness in the U.S. economy,&quot; said James Cochrane, a senior vice president at Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. &quot;There's a powerful sense that you're going to see even lower interest rates this quarter.&quot;    A few analysts contend a recession is coming, or may already have arrived. Most, though, foresee continued growth this year, although at a slower pace than last year, with inflation remaining well under control. John A. Ross, a senior vice president at Bank of New York, said there is &quot;considerably less concern over inflation these days.&quot;    Among the major developments:   --Prices of actively traded long-term Treasury bonds surged more than a point, or over $10 for each $1,000 face amount, extending an explosive rally over the past few weeks. As of late yesterday, 30-year Treasury bonds yielded about 8.30%, down from 8.43% Monday and from about 9 1/8% as recently as mid-January. When the stock market collapsed last October, long-term Treasury bond yields stood at nearly 10 1/2%.    --The bond rally came even as the Treasury launched the first of a three-part financing operation. The department sold $9.25 billion of new three-year notes at an average annual yield of 7.42%. That was down from 8.03% at the previous sale last November. The Treasury today will sell $9 billion of 10-year notes, followed by $8.75 billion of 29 1/4-year bonds tomorrow.    --Attracted by lower rates, more large companies rushed to tap the credit markets by selling new debt issues. Times Mirror Co., Southern California Edison Co., American General Corp., and Whirlpool Corp. were among the issuers. More than $1 billion of new issues was offered.    --A large volume of new state and local government debt issues also was offered yesterday. The largest new issues came from California, Puerto Rico and Cook County, Ill.    -Most short-term interest rates also declined but much less than long-term rates.    Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. led the way on yesterday's prime-rate reduction. The move came as no surprise in view of how sharply banks' own borrowing costs have dropped in the past few weeks. Some analysts said the only surprise was that banks didn't lower the rate half a percentage point to 8 1/4%.    Several bankers replied that any additional cuts will depend on whether the Federal Reserve decides to ease credit conditions. The Fed's policy committee meets next Tuesday and Wednesday to review strategy. Some bankers say the Fed won't reduce rates until much more evidence of the economy's weakness emerges. But many economists say the Fed probably will authorize a credit-easing move to be implemented in coming weeks if the economy fails to perk up, the dollar holds steady and commodity prices remain weak.    Prime-rate changes command widespread attention even though they usually tell more about where short-term interest rates already have been than where they are heading. Still, the prime rate is tremendously important for many small and medium-sized businesses because banks use the prime as a base rate on loans to these companies. In addition, many consumer loans, including home-equity borrowings, are based on the prime rate.    The prime rate, which some banks refer to as their &quot;reference&quot; rate, now stands at its lowest level since last September. Among the banks that matched the Morgan Guaranty move yesterday were Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, Bankers Trust Co., Citibank, First National Bank of Chicago, and Bank of New York. However, a spokesman for Irving Trust Co. said that, as of last evening, the bank's prime rate still was 8 3/4%.    The nation's largest companies can afford to ignore the prime rate. That's because banks are willing to offer these companies significantly lower rates in an effort to discourage them from turning to alternate sources of credit, such as overseas markets or the commercial-paper market, that aren't available to smaller companies.    Banks usually have been much faster to raise the prime rate than to lower it. Also, when they raise the prime, they often raise it half a percentage point, and when they lower it, they reduce it a quarter of a percentage point.    Yesterday's prime-rate cut shouldn't have a significant effect on bank profitability, bank specialists say. &quot;Prime-rate changes aren't as meaningful for bank profitability as in the past because so much of bank lending today is based on Libor,&quot; or the London Interbank Offered Rate, rather than on the prime, said Stephen W. Joynt, managing director in the debt rating division at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Still, the prime-rate cut, combined with the drop in the leading indicators as well as a decline in new single-family homes sold in December, helped the bond market rally continue rolling along yesterday. The size of the gains surprised some technical traders who had expected a temporary pullback. Bond prices now have increased in eight of the past 10 trading sessions.    The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators fell 0.2% in December, following revised declines of 1.2% in November and 0.1% in October. The government also said the number of new single-family homes sold in December fell 6%.    An index of long-term bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. surged about 11 1/4 points yesterday to 1327.33. It ranged between 1312.84 and 1331.31.    Among actively traded issues, the latest 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of 106 1/32 to yield 8.32%. That compared with 104 26/32 late Monday, to yield 8.43%. The latest 10-year Treasury notes rose to 104 20/32 from 103 29/32. Its yield fell to 8.18% from 8.28%.    As of late yesterday, the 10-year Treasury notes to be auctioned today were quoted in when-issued trading at 8.15% bid. The new long-term bonds to be auctioned tomorrow were quoted at 8.35% bid.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills edged lower. The rate on three-month Treasury bills declined to 5.70% bid from an average of 5.74% set at Monday's auction by the government. The rate on the latest six-month bills declined to 6.08% bid from the auction average of 6.11%.    The federal funds rate also declined. The rate on federal funds, reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.80%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down from Monday's average of 6.96%.    Here are details of yesterday's government auction of three-year Treasury notes:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                         3-Year Notes    Applications ..........................  $22,436,990,000    Accepted bids .........................   $9,253,255,000    Accepted at low price .................              92%    Accepted noncompetitively .............     $639,000,000    Average price (Rate) ..................    99.881(7.42%)    High price (Rate) .....................    99.934(7.40%)    Low price (Rate) ......................    99.855(7.43%)    Interest rate .........................           7 3/8%   The notes are dated Feb. 16 and mature Feb. 15, 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
