Rickey Ross, 40, a Los Angeles County deputy, was arrestedThursday for investigation of murder in the slayings in thegang-infested south-central area of the city.   Andy Reynolds, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said thespecial-circumstance allegations were for multiple murder. UnderCalifornia law, a convicted murderer also found guilty of specialcircumstance allegations can be put to death rather than sentencedto life imprisonment.   Ross, a narcotics investigator with the department for 18 years,was arrested for investigation of three killings, but published andbroadcast reports have said police are investigating as many as 12deaths of the south-central district's ``strawberries,'' the streetname for prostitutes who sell sex for drugs.   Attorney Jay Jaffe, who spoke to Ross on Sunday, said he hopedpolice had not rushed to arrest Ross in reaction to criticism of thedepartment's tactics in investigating the series of prostitutedeaths.   ``I hope that he is not the scapegoat for what appeared to bepublic pressure brought on the police department to come up with asuspect,'' Jaffe said.   Some sheriff's department officials had said Sunday that a gunfound in Ross' car, reportedly a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, was sobadly rusted that ballistics experts were having problems positivelylinking the weapon to the one used to kill the prostitutes.   ``This case is going to be made or broken on the ballistics, andfrom what we hear, the ballistics are pretty shaky,'' one lawenforcement officer told the Los Angeles Times.   But the Times quoted another unidentified police investigator whosaid a ``positive comparison'' had been made of bullets fired fromthe gun taken from the car trunk and those recovered from the bodiesof the three prostitutes.   ``We wouldn't put an active-duty sheriff's deputy in jail forhomicide on an `iffy' make,'' he said.   Ross was stopped in the south-central district while driving in adepartment car, sitting with an alleged prostitute at his side,authorities said Friday. The woman told police she and Ross had beensmoking rock cocaine.</TEXT></DOC>
