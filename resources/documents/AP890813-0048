The announcement Saturday was reminiscent of the CulturalRevolution of the 1966-76, when virtually all Chinese collegestudents were sent to work on farms to learn working-classattitudes.   The new order, issued by the State Education Commission andannounced in the China Daily, said only that the goal of theprogram was to ``increase the percentage of graduate students withpractical work experience.'' It said the order was aimed at``especially those in the social sciences.''   The social sciences are perceived as the most dangerous field ofstudy because they expose students to alternate political andeconomic theories.   Some fields, like sociology, were banned altogether for manyyears under Communist rule.   The government order that students work for one or two yearsfirst did not say what kind of jobs they would be given or exactlyhow many would be affected.   It said students with prior work experience _ about half of theoriginally planned incoming graduate class of 35,000 _ would beexempt.   Last week, education authorities denied Western reports that allcollege graduates assigned to government jobs will be required tospend a year working ``at the grassroots'' in small cities or ruralareas.   A spokesman for the State Education Commission, contacted bytelephone, said a 6-year-old order had indeed required studentsassigned to jobs in provincial government and higher levels to doso. However, he said few students were actually sent to suchassignments.   The government already has cut the number of incoming collegefreshmen nationwide by 30,000 to 610,000 students in an apparenteffort to curb student unrest.   Many college students who graduated in June already have beguntheir government-assigned jobs, including those assigned toprovincial governments or the central government.   China's education system has a history of combining study withassigned work for the purpose of political indoctrination. Evenafter the Cultural Revolution, middle school and college studentshave often been required to spend several weeks each summer insocial service.</TEXT></DOC>
