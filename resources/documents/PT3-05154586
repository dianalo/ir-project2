No. 07/060,336,      filed Jun. 10, 1987, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,046, which is a      continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/024,477, filed Mar. 11,      1987, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,370, which is a continuation-in-part of      application Ser. No. 06/842,287, filed Mar. 21, 1986, now U.S. Pat.

More specifically, the present invention relates to a      concentrate dispensing system including a multi-channel linear pump for      dispensing one of a plurality of concentrates to a mixing nozzle in      metered quantities. </PAR><PAR>  In the aforementioned applications of which this application is a      continuation-in-part, the concentrate supply assembly is disposable and      isolated from the remaining portions of the post-mix beverage dispensing      system. This disposable assembly of concentrate containers and supply      tubes is operatively connected to a plural channel peristaltic pump which      supplies accurate metered quantities of concentrate to a mixing nozzle.      Although the use of a peristaltic pump is quite satisfactory, it would be      desirable to provide an alternative form of multi-channel pump for pumping      accurate metered quantities of syrup in these systems. </PAR><PAR>  One form of pump which could be used is a double-acting, piston-type linear      pump driven by an A.C. synchronous motor. Since the synchronous motor is      driven at a constant speed, accurate, metered quantities of concentrate      could be pumped by turning the pump on and off at selected times, since      the concentrate flow rate would be constant during the on times of the      pump. </PAR><PAR>  Although linear pumps driven by A.C. synchronous motors are known, a need      in the art exists for such a pump which is adaptable for use as one      channel of a multi-channel linear pump in the post-mix beverage systems,      such as in the aforementioned Rudick applications. Furthermore, a need in      the art exists for a suitable manner for mounting a plurality of linear      pumps side-by-side for use as a multi-channel linear pump between the      concentrate supply and dispensing nozzle of a post-mix beverage dispensing      system. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-channel linear      concentrate pump wherein concentrate may be selectively pumped in metered      quantities from a container to a mixing nozzle in a post-mix beverage      dispenser. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-channel      linear concentrate pump which utilizes A.C. synchronous motors for      imparting reciprocating motion to double-acting piston assemblies in the      multi-channel linear concentrate pump. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the present invention to provide a compact      mounting assembly for supporting a plurality of linear pumps side-by-side      to create a multi-channel linear pump suitable for use in a post-mix      beverage dispensing system. </PAR><PAR>  It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a valving      system for a multi-channel linear pump to facilitate selective discharge      from the respective channels of the pump to the mixing nozzle of the      dispenser. </PAR><PAR>  It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a      self-centering drive assembly for the pistons of a multi-channel linear      pump. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing      a concentrate supply system for transporting concentrate to the mixing      nozzle of a post-mix beverage dispenser comprising: </PAR><PAR>  a) plurality of containers for concentrate having discharge openings      through which concentrate may flow; </PAR><PAR>  b) a corresponding plurality of double-acting linear pumps, one linear pump      being operatively associated with each of said containers by having an      inlet thereof in fluid communication with the discharge opening of the      associated container; </PAR><PAR>  c) A.C. synchronous motor means for driving each respective linear pump to      pump concentrate from said containers through the pump at a constant rate      of flow; </PAR><PAR>  d) a three-way valve connected to an outlet of each linear pump, said      three-way valve having a first position in which concentrate from the      associated outlet passes therethrough to said mixing nozzle and a second      position in which said concentrate is recirculated to the inlet of the      associated pump; and </PAR><PAR>  e) selector means for placing a selected one of said three-way valve means      in said first position and the other of said three-way valves in said      second position, </PAR><PAR>  whereby a selected one of the concentrates in the container associated with      the three-way valve in said first position is pumped to said mixing      nozzle. </PAR><PAR>  Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become      apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it      should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples,      while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way      of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the      spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in      the art from this detailed description. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed      description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are      given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the      present invention, and wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1(a) is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary post-mix      beverage dispensing system including concentrate modules, a universal      source of sugar/water syrup and a source of carbonated water connected to      the multi-channel linear concentrate pump of the present invention;

More specifically, unsweetened flavor concentrate modules 10-1,      10-2, and 10-3 contain concentrate flavors 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Each      one of the unsweetened flavor concentrate modules 10-1, 10-2, and 10-3 is      connected by means of an individual tube CN-1, CN-2 and CN-3,      respectively, to a multi-channel linear pump 10. A plurality of individual      tubes CD-1, CD-2 and CD-3 are operatively connected via pump 10 to      individual supply tubes CN-1, CN-2 and CN-3, respectively. Tubes CD-1,      CD-2, and CD-3 are also coupled to a mixing nozzle N. A universal      sugar/water syrup supply SWS is operatively connected by means of a tube      SWS-1 to a flow controller FC-2. The flow controller is connected by means      of a tube SWS-2 to a mixing nozzle N. In addition, a source of carbonated      water CW is connected by means of a conduit CW-1 to a flow control valve      FC1. The supply of carbonated water is connected by means of a tube CW-2      to the mixing nozzle N. In operation, an individual would select one of      the flavors 1, 2 or 3. As one of the flavors is selected, the      multi-channel linear pump 10 pumps unsweetened flavored concentrate at a      predetermined rate from the preselected flavor concentrate modules 10-1,      10-2, and 10-3 through the multi-channel linear pump to one of the      discharge conduits CD-1, CD-2 or CD-3. Simultaneously, the flow      controllers FC2 and FC1 supply sugar/water syrup and carbonated water at a      predetermined rate to the mixing nozzle N. The mixing nozzle N receives      the selected concentrate flavor 1, 2, or 3, the sugar/water syrup and      carbonated water simultaneously and directs the fluids to an isolated area      outboard of the nozzle so that the concentrate never touches the nozzle      walls in order to minimize the need for subsequent cleaning of the nozzle.      The system can also be used for diet drinks. In that case the flavor      concentrate inside the module contains an artificial sweetener. When the      diet product is selected, only the artificially sweetened flavor      concentrate and carbonated water in the proper proportions are allowed to      flow to the mixing nozzle. Details of the system of FIG. 1 and the mixing      nozzle are fully described in the copending application of Arthur G.      Rudick, Ser. No. 024,477, filed Mar. 11, 1987 and entitled &quot;Tri-Mix Sugar      Based Dispensing System&quot;. However, the multi-channel linear pump 10 of the      present invention has been substituted for the peristaltic pump of that      system. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1(b) illustrates a first embodiment of a multi-channel linear pump      which may be utilized together with the system illustrated in FIG. 1(a).      As illustrated in FIG. 1(b), the multi-channel linear concentrate pump 10      is provided including a first pump body 20 and a second pump body 21. A      bore 24 is disposed within the pump body 20. Similarly, a bore 25 is      disposed within the pump body 21. A piston 22 is reciprocatively mounted      within the bore 24. The piston 22 is connected to a piston shaft 26.      Similarly, a piston 23 is reciprocatively mounted within the bore 25. A      piston shaft 27 is operatively connected to the piston 23. </PAR><PAR>  A carriage 30 is mounted for reciprocation relative to the first pump body      20 and second pump body 21. The carriage 30 includes guide rods 35A, 35B.      In addition, end connectors 50A, 50B are secured to respective ends of the      guide rods 35A, 35B. The guide rod 35A is slidably mounted within a      carriage guide block 36A. Similarly, the guide rod 35B is slidably mounted      within a carriage guide block 36B. </PAR><PAR>  A motor 40 is mounted centrally relative to the first pump body 20 and      second pump body 21. A shaft 54 extends through the motor 40. Ball joint      assemblies are utilized to secure the shaft 54 and the piston shafts 26,      27 to the end connectors 50A, 50B. Ball joint 28 secures the shaft 26 to      the end connector 50A. Similarly, ball joint 32 secures one end of the      shaft 54 to the end connector 50A. The other end of the shaft 54 and the      piston rod 27 are secured to the end connector 50B by means of the ball      joints 52 and 29, respectively. The ball joint assemblies ensure that the      pistons 22 and 23 are accurately disposed within the bores 24, 25,      respectively, as the motor 40 imparts reciprocation to the shaft 54 and      thus reciprocates the carriage assembly 30 to impart reciprocation to the      piston shafts 26, 27 and the pistons 22, 23. </PAR><PAR>  A source of flavor concentrate 60 is connected by means of a conduit 62 to      an inlet supply conduit 64. The inlet supply conduit 64 is connected by      means of a fitting 81A to be in fluid communication with the bore 24. In      addition, the conduit 62 is connected to an inlet supply conduit 66. The      inlet supply conduit 66 is connected to a fitting 81B which is in fluid      communication with the bore 25. A discharge conduit 67 is connected to a      fitting 82B. The fitting 82B is in fluid communication with the bore 24.      Similarly, a discharge conduit 68 is connected to a fitting 82B. The      fitting 82B is in fluid communication with the bore 25. The discharge      conduits 67, 68 are connected to a combined discharge conduit 69. The      fittings 81A, 81B, 82A and 82B each provide passageways in fluid      communication with a one-way valve or check valve (not shown). The one-way      valve prevents flow of fluid in a reverse direction from the prescribed      flow direction. </PAR><PAR>  A three-way valve 70 is connected to the discharge conduit 69. A conduit 74      connected to the mixing nozzle N is connected to one flow path of the      three-way valve 70. In addition, a return conduit 61 is connected to      another flow path through the three-way valve 70. A valve member 72 for      connecting the discharge conduit 69 to either the conduit 74 or the      conduit 71 is disposed within the three-way valve 70. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, the motor 40 imparts reciprocation to the shaft 54. In a      first direction, the carriage 30 and thereby the end connector 50A is      reciprocated towards the left to discharge fluid within the bore 24      through the discharge conduit 67 and to the three-way valve 70. If the      three-way valve is in the &quot;off&quot; position, the valve member 72 recirculates      the concentrate through the return conduits 61 and back to the source 60.      As the shaft 54 is reciprocated in the first direction, concentrate is      supplied through the inlet supply conduit 66, the fitting 81B to the bore      25. A limit switch 93 is operatively disposed adjacent to the end      connector 50A. As the shaft 54 is reciprocated to a predetermined      position, the plunger 94 actuates the limit switch 93 to reverse the      direction of the motor 40. </PAR><PAR>  As the motor 40 reverses the direction, the shaft 54 reciprocates the      carriage and thereby the end connector 50B in a reverse direction. The      piston 23 is moved towards the right as illustrated in FIG. 1(b) to      discharge concentrate through the fitting 82B to the discharge conduits      68, 69 to the three-way valve 70. If the three-way valve 70 is in the      &quot;off&quot; position, the valve member 72 recirculates the concentrate through      the return conduit 61 back to the source 60. A limit switch 91 is      operatively mounted adjacent to the end connector 50B. As the end      connector 50B engages a plunger 92, the limit switch 91 is actuated to      reverse the direction of the motor 40. The motor 40 may be a stepping or      synchronous motor manufactured by Hurst Instrument Motors, Princeton, Ind. </PAR><PAR>  If the three-way valve 70 is in the &quot;on&quot; position, the concentrate which is      dispensed from the bores 24, 25 through the discharge conduits 67, 68,      respectively, and to the discharge conduit 69 is supplied to the conduit      74 for dispensing to the nozzle N. In the &quot;on&quot; position, the valve member      72 operatively connects the flow of fluid from the discharge conduit 69 to      the conduit 74. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate plan and crosssectional views, respectively,      of an embodiment of the present invention wherein the pump body 120 is      constructed as a single unit. In this embodiment, a piston 122 is      operatively mounted for reciprocation within a bore 124. Similarly, a      piston 123 is operatively mounted within a bore 125. A piston shaft 126 is      secured to a ball joint assembly 220. The ball joint assembly can be of      the commercially available &quot;quick release&quot; type to allow for easy      disassembly and removal of the pump body. The ball joint assembly 220      includes a housing 220A. In addition, a ball joint 220C is secured to an      end connector 150A. The piston 123 is secured to a piston shaft 127. The      piston shaft 127 is connected to an end connector of a synchronous motor      assembly, not illustrated in FIG. 2(a), in a similar manner as the piston      shaft 126 is connected to the end connector 150A. </PAR><PAR>  As illustrated in FIGS. 2(a) and 6, a manifold 201 is secured to the pump      body 120. The manifold 201 includes a fitting 203. The fitting 203 is      operatively connected to an inlet supply conduit for supplying concentrate      to either the bore 124 or the bore 125. Check valves 205, 206 of either      the &quot;duckbill&quot; type as shown in FIG. 6 or of the &quot;ball&quot; type as shown in      FIG. 2(a) are disposed within the flow path of the fluid flowing through      the manifold 201. The valves 205, 206 are one-way or check valves which      only permit the concentrate to flow from the manifold 201 into either the      bore 124 or the bore 125. In other words, during reciprocation of the      piston 122 in a first direction, the valve 205 would be open to supply      concentrate to the bore 124. At the same time, the check valve 206 is      closed to prevent concentrate within the bore 125 from communicating back      to the manifold 201. As the motor reverses direction and piston 122 moves      in an opposite direction, the check valve 205 is closed to prevent the      communication of concentrate from the bore 124 to the manifold 201. In the      reverse direction of the piston 122, the piston 123 is supplying      concentrate to the bore 125 wherein the check valve 206 is open to permit      the concentrate within the manifold 201 to be supplied to the bore 125. </PAR><PAR>  A manifold 210 is secured as an outlet manifold to the pump body 120. The      manifold 210 includes an outlet fitting 213. The outlet fitting 213 is      connected to a discharge conduit for supplying concentrate to the      three-way valve 70. A check valve 215 is operatively positioned between      the bore 124 and the passageway disposed within the manifold 210.      Similarly, a check valve 216 is operatively positioned in fluid      communication between the bore 125 and the passageway disposed within the      manifold 210. The check valves 215, 216 are one-way valves which function      in a similar manner as the check valves 205 and 206. In other words, when      the piston 122 is reciprocated towards the right, as illustrated in FIGS.      2(a) and 6, fluid is discharged from the bore 124 through the check valve      215 and the outlet fitting 213 to the discharge conduit. In this direction      of movement, the check valve 216 is closed. As the piston 123 is      reciprocated to the left, as illustrated in FIGS. 2(a) and 6, the      concentrate within the bore 125 is discharged through the check valve 216      and the manifold 210 to the outlet fitting 213 and the discharge conduit.      In this direction of movement of the piston 123, the check valve 215 is      closed. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2(a) and 6 illustrate a locator plate 217 which is utilized to secure      the pump body 120 in a predetermined position relative to the carriage      assembly 130. The carriage assembly 130 includes the end connectors 150A,      150B and the guide rods, not illustrated in FIGS. 2(a) and 6. A ball joint      assembly 220 is connected to the piston shaft 126. The ball joint assembly      includes a housing 220A secured by means of a nut 220B to the piston shaft      126. A ball socket is mounted on the stem 220C which is secured by means      of threads 220D to the end connector 150A. Similarly, a ball joint      assembly 221 is provided which is secured to the piston shaft 127. A      housing 221A is affixed by means of a nut 221B to the shaft 127.

In addition, an O-ring 222 is secured to the      piston 122. Similarly, an O-ring 223 is secured to the piston 123. The      O-rings 222 and 223 are utilized to provide a fluid-tight seal between the      pistons 122, 123 and the bores 124, 125, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  The pump body 120, as illustrated in FIG. 2(a), includes an end plate      1120A. The end plate 1120A is secured to the pump body 120 by means of      bolts 1120B, 1120C. In addition, the manifold 201 is secured to the pump      body 120 by means of bolts 201A, 201B. In addition, the manifold 210 is      secured to the pump body 120 by means of bolts 210A, 210B. An O-ring 201C      is disposed between the manifold 201 and the pump body 220.

In addition, an O-ring 201D is disposed between an interior      portion of the manifold 201 and the pump body 120. The O-rings 201C and      201D provide a fluid-tight communication to permit concentrate to flow      through the manifold and to the bores 124, 125 during respective      reciprocations of the piston 122 and 123. </PAR><PAR>  An O-ring 210C is disposed between the manifold 210 and the pump body 120.      In addition, an O-ring 210D is mounted adjacent an interior portion of the      manifold 210 and the pump body 120. The O-rings 210C and 210D provide a      fluid-tight seal between the manifold 210 and the pump body 120. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2(b) illustrates diagrammatically the positioning of a plurality of      pump bodies 120A, 120B, 120C and 120D which are of the same type as pump      body 120 of FIG. 2(a) or pump body 120 of FIG. 6, relative to end      connectors 150A and 150B. Ball joint assemblies 222A, 222B, 222C and 222D      connect respective pump bodies 120A-120D to the end connector 150A.      Similarly, ball joint assemblies 223A, 223B, 223C and 223D connect      respective pump body assemblies 120A-120D to the end connector 150B. A      shaft is connected to the end connector 150B for imparting reciprocation      to a carriage 130. The carriage 130 is mounted for reciprocation within      the carriage guide blocks 136A, 136B, 136C and 136D. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 illustrates a conventional means of securing a piston shaft 126 to      an end connector 150. A set screw 151B secures the piston shaft 126      connected to the piston 122 in a fixed orientation relative to the end      connector 150. In addition, rods 135A and 135B are secured to the end      connector 150 by means of set screws 151A, 151C, respectively. Thus, the      mounting of the piston shaft 126 and the piston 122 is in a fixed      orientation relative to the end connector 150. This arrangement is      unsatisfactory due to the fact that the piston 122, shaft 126, and end      connector 150 must be accurately machined in order for the piston 122 to      be disposed directly in the center of the bore in which it is disposed. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b) illustrate the ball joint assembly according to the      present invention. Guide rods 35, 36 are secured to an end connector 150'.      Screws 35A, 35B affix the rods 35, 36 to the end connector 150'. A ball      joint assembly 220 mounts the piston shaft 26 to the end connector 150'.      The ball joint assembly 220 includes a stem 220C affixed to the end      connector 150' by means of a threaded portion 220D. A ball 220E is secured      to the stem 220C. The ball 220E is mounted within a semispherical recess      220F in the housing 220A. In this manner, any inaccuracies in the      machining of the end connector can be readily adjusted by the movement of      the piston shaft 26 relative to the end connector 150'. Thus, the piston      22 will always be accurately disposed within the bore of the pump body.      This piston 22 will seek its own center as it reciprocates within the      bore. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5, 9 and 13 illustrate another embodiment of the present invention.      In this embodiment, a single synchronous motor 140 is secured to a shaft      141. The motor 140 may be a motor manufactured by Oriental Motor of      Torrance, Calif. The shaft 141 is a toothed rack. A spacer block 143 is      provided to mount the motor 140 relative to the base B. The spacer block      mounts the motor at a predetermined distance above the base B in order to      properly align shaft 141 with end connector 150B. A carriage assembly 130      includes end connectors 150A, 150B and guide rods 135A, 135B. The guide      rod 135A is mounted for reciprocation within the carriage guide blocks      136A, 136B. Similarly, the guide rod 135B is mounted for reciprocal motion      within the carriage guide blocks 136C, 136D. The pump bodies 120A and 120C      are fixed relative to the motor 140. Thus, as the shaft 141 is      reciprocated to cause reciprocation of the carriage 130, the pistons      disposed on the piston shafts will reciprocate within the pump bodies      120A, 120C. </PAR><PAR>  The manifold includes a fluid passageway 185 which is connected to the bore      125. Concentrate is supplied to the bore 125 through the passageway 185. A      piston 123 is affixed to the piston shaft 127. Similar pistons (not shown)      are secured to shafts 126, 126' and 127', respectively. The piston shaft      127 is secured to the end connector 150B by means of a ball joint assembly      128. The ball joint assembly 128 includes a ball joint fitting 129A for      permitting movement between the piston shaft 127 and the end connector      150B. Similarly, the piston shaft 127' is secured to the end connector      150B by means of a ball joint 129B. Further, the shafts 126 and 126' are      secured to the end connector 150A by means of a ball joint connection      132A, 132B. A limit switch 193 is disposed to be positioned adjacent to      the end connector 150A. As the synchronous motor 140 reciprocates the      shaft 141, the end connector 150A will engage the plunger 194. This      movement will actuate the limit switch 193 to reverse the direction of the      motor 140. As the motor 140 operates in the reverse direction, the shaft      141 will move the end connector 150B towards the right as illustrated in      FIG. 5. Engagement of the end connector 150B with the plunger 192 will      actuate the limit switch 191. Actuation of the limit switch 191 will cause      the motor 140 to reverse its direction. As an individual selects a flavor      (one of two in FIG. 5) to be dispensed from the system, the three-way      valve corresponding to the particular flavor is actuated to be in the &quot;on&quot;      position. The other remains in the &quot;off&quot; position. When the user places a      cup or other finished drink container into the system, motor 140 is      actuated causing the selected flavor concentrate to flow to the nozzle. As      the flavor is dispensed through the nozzle N, the sugar/water syrup and      carbonated water are simultaneously dispensed thereto. When an individual      removes the finished drink container from the system, the motor 140 is      deactuated and will not be reactuated until another flavor is selected by      an individual. Simultaneously, both three-way valves return to the &quot;off&quot;      position. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 9 and 13 illustrate a locator plate 217A, 217B for securing the pump      body, such as 120A and 120C of FIG. 5, to the base B. The locator plates      217A, 217B are spaced a predetermined distance above the base B by means      of spacers 217C, 217D. The spacing of the pump body 120B above the base B      permits a manifold to be affixed to supply fluid to the pump body 120B      from underneath. FIG. 13 illustrates the pump body 120C secured to the      locator plates 217A, 217B. A three-way valve 170 is operatively connected      to the pump body 120C. A discharge conduit 167 and a return conduit 161      are secured to the three-way valve 170. A dispensing conduit 174 is      connected to supply concentrate from the pump body 120B to the nozzle N. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 illustrates an &quot;off&quot; position of the three-way valve 70.

FIG. 8 illustrates an &quot;on&quot;      position of the three-way valve. The valve member 72 connects the conduit      67 to the discharge conduit 74. In this position, concentrate is pumped      through the pump body 20 to discharge conduit 74 and to the nozzle N. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate another embodiment of the present invention. In      this embodiment, individual motors 240A, 240B are operatively connected to      individual shafts 241A, 241B. The individual shaft 241A is connected to a      carriage 230A. In addition, the shaft 241B is connected to the carriage      230B. </PAR><PAR>  The carriage 230A includes guide rods 235A, 235B. Carriage guide blocks      236A, 236B, 236C and 236D guide the reciprocation of the rods to 235A,      235B as the end connectors 250B, 250A are reciprocated by means of the      motor 240A. The carriage guide blocks 236A, 236B are integral members with      the pump body 320A. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, guide rods 245A, 245B are mounted on the end connectors 260A,      260B. Carriage guide blocks 246A, 246B, 246C and 246D guide the movement      of the guide rods 245A, 245B. Pump bodies 320A, 320B are fixed relative to      the base. The carriages 230A, 230B reciprocate to impart movement to the      pistons disposed within the pump bodies 320A, 320B upon selective      operation of the motor 240A, 240B. </PAR><PAR>  As illustrated in FIG. 11, the pump body 320A includes an inlet manifold      401 secured to the lower side thereof. An output manifold 410 is connected      to an upper portion of the pump body 320A. Spacers 417C, 417D mount the      pump body 320A upwardly relative to the base B so as to permit the      manifold 401 to supply concentrate to the pump body 320A. A mounting plate      243 secures the motor 240A relative to the base B. In this manner, the      shaft 241A is mounted at approximately the same disposition as the piston      shaft 327. </PAR><PAR>  The connection of the piston shafts to the end connectors 250A, 250B, 260A      and 260B includes a ball joint assembly.

The inlet manifold 401' includes a passageway 430 disposed therein.      An inlet fitting 431 is connected to the passageway 430. One-way valves      are disposed relative to the passageway 430 to permit only a supply of      concentrate to the pump body 320'. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention. A single      synchronous motor 440 is centrally mounted relative to a pump body 420. A      piston 422 is affixed to one end of a shaft 441. A piston 423 is affixed      to the other end of the shaft 441. The piston 422 is mounted for      reciprocation within the bore 424. Similarly, the piston 423 is mounted      for reciprocation within the bore 425. </PAR><PAR>  Concentrate is supplied to the bore 424 through an inlet fitting 405A and a      one-way duckbill check valve 405B. Concentrate is discharged from the bore      424 through a one-way duckbill check valve 415B and an outlet fitting      415A. Similarly, concentrate is supplied to the bore 425 through an inlet      fitting 406A and a one-way duckbill check valve 406B. Concentrate is      discharged from the bore 425 through the outlet fitting 416A and a one-way      duckbill check valve 416B. An O-ring 523 is mounted on the piston 423. In      addition, an O-ring 522 is mounted on the piston 422. The O-rings 522 and      523 produce a fluid-tight seal within the bores 424, 425 of the pump body      420. </PAR><PAR>  The motor 440 reciprocates the shaft 441 within the bores 424 and 425.      Metal sensors 450, 451 detect the positioning of the pistons 422, 423      relative to the motor 440 to reverse the direction of rotation of the      motor. Shaft 441 is mounted slightly off center with respect to the bores      424 and 425 to prevent the shaft and pistons from rotating during      reciprocation. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 is a partially enlarged view of an alternative form of a drive      connection wherein a synchronous A.C. motor 640 is connected to a rotary      gear head 642. The direction of rotation of the synchronous A.C. motor 640      is always in the same direction. This embodiment is different from      previous embodiments of the present invention wherein the rotation of the      synchronous A.C. motor must be reversed in direction in order to pump      fluid from the multi-channel linear concentrate pump. The gear head 642 is      connected to a coupler 644 by means of a shaft 643. A ball reverser 646 is      connected to the coupler 644. The gear head 642 is a rotary gear head for      imparting constant rotation to the shaft 643 and the coupler 644. The ball      reverser 646 is rotated within a sleeve 648 mounted on the carriage 650.      The specific construction of the ball reverser 646 may be similar to a      NORCO Ball Reverser. This construction permits an instant turnaround and      eliminates the need for limit switches to reverse the direction of the      motor as is necessary in previous embodiments of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 is a partial cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the      present invention wherein a pump body 620 is illustrated to include a bore      624 in which a piston 622 is mounted for reciprocation.

A piston shaft 627 is operatively connected to the piston 623 and      to a ball joint assembly 621. The check valves are not mounted within the      pump body as set forth in previous embodiments of the present invention.      The fittings 616 and 615 are in fluid communication with the bores 624 and      625. The fittings 615, 616 are connected with in-line check valves which      will be further identified with reference to FIG. 17. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 is a partial cross-sectional and schematic view illustrating a      centrally disposed linear stepping motor 640. The linear stepping motor      640 may be utilized instead of a synchronous linear motor as set forth in      previous embodiments of the present invention. The linear stepping motor      640 would permit the speed of the pump to be adjusted, thereby adjusting      the flow rate. Further, the stepping motor 640 could be controlled by an      appropriate microprocessor base device using input from a flow sensor on      the water side of the system. </PAR><PAR>  A pump body 620A includes a bore 625A in which a piston 623A is mounted for      reciprocation. The piston 623A is affixed to a shaft 641. Similarly, a      bore 624A is provided wherein a piston 622A is operatively mounted for      reciprocation. The piston 622A is affixed to the shaft 641. The shaft 641      is off-center slightly with respect to the center of the bore. In this      manner, as the drive nut inside the motor 640 rotates, the pistons 623A      and 624A reciprocate within the bore and are prevented from rotating. </PAR><PAR>  The fittings 615A and 616A are in fluid communication with the bores 624A      and 625A, respectively. Metal sensors 651, 652 detect the positioning of      the pistons 622A, 623A, respectively. As the pistons 622A, 623A move      relative to the motor 640, the sensors 651, 652 reverse the direction of      the motor. </PAR><PAR>  An in-line check valve system 700 is provided. Inlet conduit 701 is      connected to coupling 702. Coupling 702 diverts the flow of fluid to      either the conduit 703 or 704. A one-way check valve 705 is in fluid      communication with the conduit 703. Similarly, a check valve 706 is in      fluid communication with the conduit 704. A conduit 707 is connected to a      coupling 709. Conduit 711 is connected to the coupling 709 and to the      fitting 615A.

An      outlet conduit 721 is connected to the coupling 720. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 17, the following operation of the in-line check valve      700 will be explained. Assuming the piston 622A is reciprocated to move      towards the left in FIG. 17, fluid flowing through conduit 701 will flow      through the coupling 702, the conduit 704, the one-way check valve 706,      the conduit 708, the coupling 710, the conduit 712 to the fitting 616A and      into the bore 625A. Fluid within the bore 624A is discharged through the      fitting 615A, the conduit 711, the coupling 709, the conduit 713, the      one-way check valve 715, the conduit 717, the coupling 720, and to the      outlet conduit 721. The pressure of the fluid within the bore 624A, as it      exits through the system, will place a pressure on the one-way check valve      705 to close the check valve. Similarly, pressure will be exerted on the      check valve 716 to close the check valve. In this way, the fluid will be      permitted to exit from the system while fluid is supplied to the bore      625A. </PAR><PAR>  Reviewing FIG. 17, if we assume that the piston 623A is moving towards the      right, fluid will be in the process of being discharged from the bore 625A      through the fitting 616A, the conduit 712, the coupling 710, the conduit      714, the one-way check valve 716, the conduit 718, the coupling 720 to the      outlet conduit 721. The pressure of fluid exiting from the system will      apply a pressure to the one-way check valve 706 to close the check valve.      During the exit of the fluid from the bore 625A, fluid is being supplied      to the bore 624A. Fluid flows into the conduit 701, the coupling 702, the      conduit 703, the one-way check valve 705, the conduit 707, the coupling      709, the conduit 711, the fitting 615A to the bore 624A. The one-way check      valve 715 is closed by the pressure of the fluid exiting from the bore 625      through the various conduits to apply a back pressure on the one-way check      valve 715. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 18 is a schematic view illustrating four mechanically independent      one-channel linear pumps 801, 802, 803 and 804 which are arranged      side-by-side.

Electrical quick disconnects 806, 807, 808 and 809      are provided for connecting the electrical cables 806A, 807A, 808A and      809A which are operatively connected to the linear pumps 801, 802, 803 and      804, respectively. Motors 1640, 1641, 1642 and 1643 are operatively      connected with a respective linear pump 801, 802, 803 and 804. The motors      1640-1643 may be either synchronous or stepping type motors. If the motors      1640-1643 are stepping motors, the motor speed and thereby the flow rate      can be controlled by the electronics. If the motors 1640-1643 are      synchronous, the motor speed, and therefore, the flow rate is constant.      Stepping motors permit a ratio adjustment by adjusting the fluid flow      rate. </PAR><PAR>  An in-line check valve arrangement 1701, 1702, 1703 and 1704 are      operatively connected to respective linear pumps 801, 802, 803 and 804.

The other      concentrates which are not selected, are merely recirculated and are not      supplied to the mixing nozzle N. As the predetermined flavor is discharged      to the mixing nozzle N, the sugar/water syrup and carbonated water are      supplied to the mixing nozzle in the proper proportions and are dispensed      into the finished drink cup. As the individual removes the finished drink      cup from the unit, the motor is deactuated to stop further movement of the      pistons disposed within the multi-channel linear pump. </PAR><PAR>  In one embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 10, 11,      14, 17 and 18, individual motors such as 240A, 240B (FIG. 10) or 440 (FIG.      14) may be directly connected to the flavor selection actuator. In this      embodiment, as an individual selects a predetermined flavor, only one of      the motors will be actuated to dispense a predetermine quantity of      concentrate to the mixing nozzle. As the concentrate is supplied to the      mixing nozzle, sugar/water syrup and carbonated water are supplied thereto      and mixed to form the finished drink. As the finished drink cup is removed      from the system, the individual motor is deactuated to stop further      dispensing of the concentrate. </PAR><PAR>  The limit switches according to the present invention may be utilized to      stop actuation of the motor when the carriage has been displaced to      actuate the limit switch. In this embodiment, the motor would be actuated      for a predetermined time to dispense the necessary quantity of flavor      concentrate to the mixing nozzle N. </PAR><PAR>  The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be      varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure      from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as      would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included      within the scope of the following claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
