Finance Minister Yitzhak Moda'i caused a furor when heproposed recently that the U.S. eliminate annual economicassistance to Israel by the end of the decade in exchange forgranting the $10 billion in loan guarantees that the countryis seeking to help absorb Jewish immigrants from thedisintegrating Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   While spokesmen for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's officewere quick to stress that Mr. Moda'i's proposal wasn't aformal offer, the finance minister's remarks are one of thestrongest signs that the government is waking up to theeconomic implications of the growing unpopularity of foreignaid in Congress and among the U.S. public.   &quot;This is not a haphazard proposal. The new immigrants willtranslate into a fast-growing economy. We want to use thischance to get off aid,&quot; said David Naveh, acting director ofthe international division at the Finance Ministry.   The emerging new mood is partly the result of growinganxiety among Israeli officials that the political price ofcontinued aid may be territorial concessions during the peaceprocess.   Proponents of liberalization of the state-dominatedeconomy also have come forward with suggestions on how Israelcan wean itself from U.S. aid, which over the past 40 yearshas totaled more than $41.5 billion. Israel currentlyreceives $3 billion a year in military aid and assistance inrepaying previous debts on American loans for arms purchases.   Among the voices currently being heard:   -- In a paper to be submitted to Prime Minister Shamirnext month, 12 economists, professors, and analysts under theauspices of the hawkish political journal, Nativ, argue thatcuts can be made in U.S. aid. They propose that Israel forgothe $300 million-$400 million a year that the U.S. grants forarms procurement in Israel. In addition, they contend thateconomic assistance could be eliminated if the U.S. forgaveinterest payments on the loans and required Israel to repayjust the principal.   -- The Institute for Advanced Strategic and PoliticalStudies, a research and public policy organization inJerusalem, argues in several reports that Israel could reduceits dependence on aid by selling off state-owned businesses,which are collectively worth billions of dollars. It alsoadvocates slashing the state budget by eliminatingapproximately $4.3 billion it has identified as wastefulspending.   -- In a recent issue of the newsweekly the JerusalemReport, editor in chief Hirsh Goodman urged the government tostreamline the bureaucracy, encourage entrepreneurialprojects by the new immigrants, raise needed capital throughthe stock market, and sell off its vast land holdings inorder to reach economic independence.   Of course, not everyone thinks that Israeli financialself-sufficiency is possible right now. Zvi Sussman, directorof research at the Israeli International Institute forApplied Economic Policy Review in Tel Aviv, contends thatfinancing the costs associated with the massive immigrationwill require more funding, not less.   Amos Rubin, economic adviser to Prime Minister Shamir,says that the significance of U.S. aid continues to declinebecause the real value of the money drops each year becauseof inflation. But he says that implementing any furtherreductions in the aid would be difficult while Israel's debtremains high.   &quot;The repayments will decline eventually, and that willopen the way for a parallel decline in economic assistance,&quot;says Mr. Rubin. Nonetheless, that could take years: Accordingto Mr. Rubin's figures, annual repayments won't drop belowthe $1 billion mark until 1997.   Those pressing for change say that Israel may not be ableto wait that long. &quot;With the American economy the way it is,the aid can't continue,&quot; says Arie Stav, the editor of Nativ.&quot;So isn't it better if we earn points by going to theAmericans and saying we don't want it anymore, rather thanhaving them come to us?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
