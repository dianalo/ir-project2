The aim of this paper is to consider the thermodynamicand economic aspects of pressurized fluidized bed and gasification combinedcycles which are affected by materials factors, in order to set intocontext the necessary high temperature alloy research. In pressurizedfluidized bed systems the critical materials requirements are in thecombustor, hot gas clean up system and gas turbine. In gasification combinedcycles there is the specific requirement in many systems of the raw gasheat exchanger. It is also essential to have an advanced turbine withhigh (1250 C) turbine entry temperature, but as the gas can be cleanedas much as necessary no specific problems such as corrosion result. Indeedfor both types of cycle the system limiting materials factors are corrosionand/or erosion rather than mechanical properties. Recent work and directionsfor further work are summarized for each critical plant area. In general,high temperature alloy solutions for each critical requirement can beproposed but not always without limiting the system efficiency or ata significant cost. 43 refs., 5 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
