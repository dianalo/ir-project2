And when the Iraqi government cut that off, we hadlive coverage of air raids on Tel Aviv.;    Television brought Vietnam intoour living rooms. But this time we watch in real time. That helps account forthe huge majorities that now support the war, nationally and in Santa ClaraCounty. But if the war isn't over quickly, the intense coverage could pushpublic opinion the other way.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE COURSE OF WARSO FAR, ISRAEL HAS SHOWN ADMIRABLE RESTRAINTIN NOT RETALIATING AGAINST IRAQ  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     (check) Meanwhile, who would have thought that after four days, the fightwould be so lopsided? It's eerie for Iraq to offer such scant resistance. Yetall the experts warn us: A nasty ground war could still be in the cards.;   (check) For Americans long conditioned to bad news about weapons that don'twork, it's almost shocking to see U.S. military technology perform with suchprecision. A missile shoots down a missile over Saudi Arabia. Cruise missileshit 51 of their first 52 targets. U.S. and allied forces fly nearly 5,000missions before losing the first 10 planes.;    Even for those of us whoconsider this war premature or ill-advised, there is some solace in knowingthat credible military machines are in hand, should we need them for a greaterthreat.;    And for those of us who want this war to stop short of the totaldestruction of Iraq, there is some comfort in the precision with which ourplanes have hit military targets, if reports are true.;    And yet, for allthe vaunted U.S. electronic weaponry and jamming equipment, it has beenrelatively old-fashioned, Scud missiles from Iraq that have most seriouslythreatened to escalate the war beyond control.;    Adding good news on top ofirony, the conventional-warhead Scuds landed in Tel Aviv Friday and Saturdaywithout killing anyone. But thousands of Israelis spent terrified hours insealed shelters wearing gas masks -- and the attack threatened to draw aretaliation that would suck Israel into the war and perhaps shatter thecoalition against Iraq.;    President Bush acted correctly in supplyingPatriot anti-missile missiles and American crews to Israel. Under tremendouspressure from Washington to stay out of the war, and under growing pressure athome to get in, the Israeli government, as of late Saturday night, was stillexhibiting admirable restraint.;    A wise Israel must realize thatretaliation will do less to win the war than it will to undermine thepermanence of the eventual peace.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910120  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  428  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 20, 199100020145,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
