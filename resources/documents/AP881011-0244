Clarke told a gathering of bankers Monday at the 114thannual convention of the American Bankers Association here.   ``My mission is to challenge you to think...in broad terms toavoid placing banking in the position of being a prisoner ofevents.''   About a quarter of the 3,200 federally insured Sandamp;Ls areconsidered insovlent or close to it, with most of the problemthrifts concentrated in the energy and farm belts. Those Sandamp;Lsaccounted for a large portion of the $3.6 billion in overall lossesby thrifts in the second quarter.   Estimates for the cost of liquidating or bailing out thetroubled thrifts have ranged from $45 billion to $100 billion. Someexperts say the taxpayers may have to pick up at least some of thetab.   Clarke said it was inevitable that Congress and the nextpresident would consider merging the healthy Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which insures most of the 14,000 commercial banksand a few thrifts, with the weaker Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., the main Sandamp;L insurer.   If that occurred, Clarke said, ``it is conceivable that a mergerof the FDIC and FSLIC funds could lead to a merger of all thedepository institution regulatory authorities.''   The FDIC and FSLIC both insure deposits of individuals for up to$100,000. But while the FSLIC posted a $13.7 billion deficit lastyear, the FDIC had $18 billion in reserves and expects to havefunds totaling $15 billion by year's end.   ``Merging the FDIC insurance fund with the thrift insurance fundhas a political attractiveness,'' said Clarke, whose agenciesregulates nationally chartered banks. ``Certainly there isn'tenough money in the FDIC fund to solve the problem, but the fund isenough to serve as a significant downpayment, and it is available.''   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman and the ABA long have opposedmerging the two insurance funds.   For one thing, bankers fear a merger would drive up the cost oftheir their insurance premiums, which are about 2{ percentagepoints below what thrifts pay.   Bankers also worry that tapping into the FDIC may aggravate thebanks' own failure problem. The FDIC says a record number of bankswill fail this year _ as many as 250 _ compared with a record 184banks that closed last year and 19 others that needed federalassistance.   Clarke says he also is against an FDIC-FSLIC merger, but ``ifthe banking industry refuses to acknowledcge even the merepossibility of using FDIC funds as part of a solution to the thriftcrisis, it is walking away from the table.''   At a news conference Monday, the ABA's newly elected president,Thomas Rideout, said the thrift crisis was a top priority of thetrade group, along with banking-reform legislation.   The ABA released a report last month calling for insolventthrifts to be liquidated at a faster pace. It also criticized theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, for failingto provide proper supervision of Sandamp;Ls.</TEXT></DOC>
