But of course.   The stars of the Republican National Convention aren't justpoliticos. They also include the likes of actor Charlton Heston,evangelist Billy Graham, and billionaire real estate developerDonald Trump.   ``The people who use aliases, they want complete privacy,''Andrade said. ``They have stressed complete privacy. They onlyallow myself and one waiter into the private dining rooms.''   A bunch of senators used the alias ``Jackson'' to reserve partyspace in the Sazerac. The Rev. Jerry Falwell's private table washeld Wednesday night under the name of an assistant, Andrade said.   Curious pedestrians are cued by the arrival of stretchlimousines, and some surge forward in hopes of a handshake,autograph, or greeting. Jere Smith, a spokesman for PhillipsPetroleum, said his bosses from Oklahoma were embarrassed whenpeople bolted into busy streets to peer through their limousine'stinted windows. A few onlookers posed for photographs beside theluxurious wheels, he said.   Trump said his invitation to the convention revelry came fromVice President George Bush. They both were checked into thehigh-rise Marriott, overlooking the Mississippi River. ``I'mlooking at this as a vacation. I'm really here to watch,'' Trumpsaid.   Heston wowed Michigan delegates during a Wednesday gatheringwith a blast at Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who led the``Where was George?'' chant during last month's Democratic NationalConvention.   ``It would have occurred to me to say to the senator, `Georgewas dry, sober and home with his wife,''' said Heston, a native ofSt. Helen, Mich.   Heston also appeared at parties sponsored by the National RifleAssociation. So did strongman actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, aRepublican whose wife, Maria Shriver, is kin to the Kennedys.   But Schwarzenegger didn't make a much-anticipated visit to aconfab of the Mississippi delegation, said chairwoman EvelynMcPhail.   ``I was looking forward to meeting Arnold Schwarzenegger,'' saidMs. McPhail, who hasn't seen any of the muscleman's films. ``I'veonly heard of him because of his weightlifting. I'm not amoviegoer.''   The Mississippi delegation chief endorses using celebrities toget attention for political causes. ``If it doesn't have aninfluence on how people vote, at least it's magnetism in gettingthem to listen,'' Ms. McPhail said.</TEXT></DOC>
