He's driving home from his machine tool factory. Sikh militantsin turbans of iridescent orange surround his car and police are toofrightened to help.   ``I see the nozzles of the guns and they fire and everythinggoes red,'' he said.   These days in Punjab, Singh's nightmare is often a reality, andbeing a Sikh does not exempt him from the terror.   Sikh militants have killed about 1,400 people so far this yearin their fight for a separate nation called Khalistan, or Land ofthe Pure. Security forces have killed nearly 250 of the extremistsand some innocent bystanders.   Government officials fear 1990 will be the deadliest year sincethe separatist violence began nine years ago.   A seemingly endless spiral of harsh police crackdowns, risingcrime, unemployment and the introduction of advanced weapons by themilitants has thrown this rich agricultural state into chaos.   The increasing violence threatens the position of Prime MinisterV.P. Singh, who has partially staked his prestige on being able tosolve the problem.   Punjab's geography adds complications. It adjoins both Pakistan,India's long-time antagonist, and Jammu-Kashmir state, where amovement within the state's Moslem majority seeks independence fromIndia.   Sikh militants in Punjab are believed to be one source ofweapons for Kashmir's separatists, and India has accused Pakistanof providing arms and training to rebels in both states. Pakistandenies it.   ``We are facing a war,'' said Narinderpal Singh, police chief ofPunjab's Tarn Taran district. ``It seems like it will go onforever.''   Singh, which means lion, is part of every Sikh name, but alsohas become a common surname for Hindus. Prime Minister Singh is aHindu.   The fields of Punjab are green and lined with trees. Thenorthwestern state is India's breadbasket, producing 60 percent ofthe country's rice and wheat.   Terror dominates the lush countryside. Hindus, once the maintarget of Sikh militants, have abandoned dozens of villages aroundthe Sikh holy city of Amritsar, an agricultural center 250 milesnorthwest of New Delhi.   Fellow Sikhs like Kartar Singh now bear the brunt of theseparatists' wrath.   ``They either say we're police informants or we don't loveKhalistan enough,'' he said.   In Tarn Taran, 121 of the 137 civilians killed so far this yearwere Sikhs.   ``Even a barking dog makes me afraid now,'' said Gurmit Kaur, a20-year-old Sikh woman in Harike village, 30 miles south ofAmritsar. ``Everything sounds like gunshots.''   Last April, Ms. Kaur watched as militants dragged her fatherfrom their farmhouse and killed him under an oak tree. They accusedhim of being a police informer.   No one turns to the government for help.   Police and other security forces have been blamed for hundredsof deaths. Officials acknowledge security forces have tortured Sikhprisoners and killed suspected militants in ``fake encounters.''   ``We are stopping that now,'' Virendra Verma, governor ofPunjab, said in an interview. ``We are trying to win back thehearts of the people.''   Verma recently announced creation of 10,000 police andparamilitary jobs for unemployed Sikhs. Critics say the programwill help the militants by giving thousands of Sikhs access toweapons.   Many Punjabis say police brutality continues.   In Rajchauck village, half a mile from Pakistan, residents saypolice beat 20-year-old Baljit Singh to death in early June. AfterSingh was arrested, villagers went to the police station to pleadfor his release, saying he was not a militant. The police said hehad committed suicide.   Federal authorities recently sent the National Security Guard,an anti-terrorist force known as the ``Black Cats,'' back intoPunjab. The action appears destined to stir up more enmity, evenamong law enforcement officers.   The Black Cats, predominantly Hindu, generally have been usedonly in extreme situations, such as sieges to dislodge militantsfrom the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of Sikhism.   ``Last year they came to our village and killed a bootlegger andtwo laborers, none of them ... militants,'' said Jagdeep Singh, aSikh police chief in Harike village. ``This year, they'll doworse.''   His comment highlights a growing gulf between Hindus and Sikhsin the state.   A decade ago, the two communities frequently intermarried andHindu families adopted a tradition of raising one son as a Sikh.That tradition died as the ethnic conflict grew.   Sikhism began in the 15th century as an alternative to the rivalHindu and Moslem faiths, combining Hindu rituals with Islam'sbelief in one god.   It became a warrior faith after Moslem Moguls beheaded a Sikhprophet in the late 17th century. His son ordered all Sikh men tobecome soldiers of the faith and take the name Singh.   Sikh religious law requires men to wear a knife and prohibitsthem from cutting their hair or beards, which are considered signsof virility.   In 1981, Sikh radicals began the campaign for Khalistan to savewhat they described as their dying culture.   Militants attacked Hindus in Punjab, where about 60 percent ofthe people are Sikhs. In India as a whole, Sikhs make up only 2percent of the 880 million people and Hindus are 82 percent.   Separatists stored weapons in the Golden Temple. On June 3,1984, the army attacked the temple in ``Operation Bluestar,'' whichSikhs say defiled the shrine. More than 1,200 people were killed,most of them Sikhs.   Six months later, two Sikh bodyguards assassinated PrimeMinister Indira Gandhi. Hindu mobs rampaged in northern India,killing more than 3,000 Sikhs.   In 1988, the government again besieged the Golden Temple,killing 46 people. Plainclothes security agents now patrol thegrounds and armed guards search visitors.   Sikh militants fled to the Mand, a snake-infested mixture ofbadlands and swamp at the confluence of the Satlug and Beas rivers,which run through the heart of Punjab.   Authorities say the area is impossible to patrol. ``The only wayto really beat the terrorists is to release lions into thatswamp,'' said Ashok Kumar, who commands a company of the BorderSecurity Force responsible for the Mand.   He said the Sikhs are the best-armed militants in India, withnight vision devices, plastic explosives, automatic rifles,rocket-propelled grenades and shoulder-launched rockets.   Police said the separatists had stolen about $1 million fromPunjab banks in the past three months. They have kidnapped hundredsof people for ransoms totaling another $1 million.   ``India must accept Khalistan or there will be total anarchy,''said Rajinder Singh Mehta, head of the Sikh Students Federation,one of about 10 Sikh militant groups.   Even farming, Punjab's lifeline, has come under attack.   Militants have killed 24 members of the Rice Millers Associationthis year, including 10 Sikhs, and held 100 for ransom, said AshokSachdeva, a Hindu who heads the association and seldom leaves hishome in Amritsar.   ``What is life if there is no freedom?'' he asked. ``All of usin Punjab are like caged birds.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 22</NOTE></DOC>
