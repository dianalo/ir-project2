Bureau of the Census.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Census Adds 3 VAXes to Its LEgions of ComputersandM;In September and October the Census Bureau will add three VAX 9000 mainframesto its installed base of several hundred VAXes and MicroVAXes.andM;Two of the VAX 9000s will go to the bureau's Charlotte, N.C., computer centerto work with 1990 census data and produce geographic products relating to thecensus, said Gerald Cranford, the bureau's assistant director for ADP.andM;The other VAX will operate at the Washington headquarters building, andprimarily do demographic and economic survey work.andM;The mainframes are coming in under an enginering upgrade clause in a contractsigned in 1987 for an $80 million family of minicomputers, Cranford said.andO;The minicomputers started arriving for the 1990 decennial census, the 1992agriculture and economic census, geographic programs supporting the 1990census and interactive survey analysis.andM;When the contract began, Digital Equipment Corp.'s high-end machine was theVAX 8700, and the update clause also allowed the bureau to bring in VAX6000s.andP;  &quot;There's not a lot of difference in the CPU performance between the8800 and the 6000, but the input/output bus is far superior,&quot; Cranford said.andM;Before the contract, bureau operations were batch-oriented around largemainframes, Cranford said.andM;Although the bureau is best known fo rits decennial census, it also performsmonthly household and economic surveys and quarterly and yearly economicsurveys.andP;  Over time, these surveys produce as much data as the main censusoperation, officials often have said.andM;Census analysts ae demanding more desktop tools to help them manipulate andanalyze surveys and statistical data.andM;Census has a few Sun Microsystems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., and IBM Corp.andO;workstations, and is evaluating the DECstation 3100 Ultrix workstation, saidMichael Fortier, automation, adviser to Census's associate director fordemographic programs.andM;Average Census surveys are 125 million to 175 million characters, and 1990census files will be massive, Fortier said.andP;  &quot;If users go with small datasets 40M to 80M in size, even the 486 PCs cannot perform interactive dataanalysis,&quot; he said.andM;With the workstations, analysts can bring the extracted survey down from theDEC host and have on-line, live access to the data, yet still have theability to &quot;beat it [the data] up and not affect the other users,&quot; Fortiersaid.andM;One desktop analysis tool is applications systems software from SAS InstituteInc. of Cary, N.C., Fortier said.andP;  The software resides on a VAX 8700 and8810 cluster, and at least 100 active SAS users access the cluster.andP;  Close to300 users will access the software in the next few years, he said.andM;The applications system includes SAS/Connect, cooperative processing softwarethat transfers data and applications between operating platforms, andSAS/Insight, an interasctive tool for graphic visualization and exploratorydata observations.andM;The software now runs on the Sun-4 and Hewlett-Packard workstations, and isbeing ported to the IBM RISC System/6000 and DEC workstations.andP;  &quot;We want theinteractive survey analysis data to be compatible on the desktop&quot; and the DECcluster, Fortier said.andM;Census is a beta test site for the SAS Applications System under RISC/Ultrix.andM;SAS software is the only required constant as Census grows across hardwareplatforms.andP;  Although Census is a &quot;heavy SAS shop, we haven't abandoned othersolutions,&quot; Fortier said.andM;The bureau is standardizing on TCP/IP so networks and software are compatiblethroughout Census, Fortier said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
