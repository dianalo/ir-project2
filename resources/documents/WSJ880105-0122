Separately, ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. fractionally raised its holding in BRITOIL PLC.    The Kuwaiti agency, the London-based investment-management arm of the Kuwaiti government, boosted its BP interest to 18.34% from 18.03% by purchasing shares on London's stock exchange last Thursday. Trading of BP shares in London was heavy yesterday, prompting speculation that the agency was adding to its stake. The agency has bought BP shares aggressively amid speculation that its holding will climb to about 25% soon.    BP has said it is happy to have the Kuwaiti agency as an institutional investor. The agency has said it views its BP stake as a long-term investment.    Meanwhile, U.S.-based Arco said share purchases Thursday lifted its Britoil stake to 21.25% from 21.21%.    Arco began building its Britoil stake in mid-December, and proposed increasing its stake to 49.9%, partly through a share-and-asset swap. Arco has yet to make a formal offer for Britoil shares.    Britoil already is the target of a #1.59 billion ($2.98 billion) bid from BP. </TEXT></DOC>
