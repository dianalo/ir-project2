Rep. Barney Frank (D.,Mass.) chides reporters that &quot;there are real issues to bewritten about.&quot; Rep. Bill Clay (D., Mo.) says, &quot;If the publicis upset over the House's banking flap, I'm ashamed of 'em.&quot;GOP Minority Leader Bob Michel frets about &quot;undue criticism,&quot;and says a late-night check-cashing office should stillremain open &quot;in case members need a few bucks to buy dinner.&quot;Even James Glassman, publisher of Roll Call, the Capitol Hillpaper that broke the scandal, says it's &quot;absurd&quot; for Kitegateto be front-page news.   Is it? A caller to a C-SPAN talk show summed up thefeelings of many Americans when he noted that while thecheck-kiting and the $300,000 members owe for Capitol Hillmeals may not be mega-scandals, the symbolism is rich. &quot;I betnone of these congressmen bounce checks in their personalaccounts back home or stiff restaurants,&quot; he said. &quot;Yet whenit comes to their workplace or the nation's budget they'reout of control. They've exempted themselves not only frommost laws but society's rules.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Kitegate so clearly shows members wallowing in privilegeand hypocrisy that it has become a symbol of Congress'sdeeper institutional problems, rooted in the domination ofthe body by career politicians. Walter Mears, an AssociatedPress vice president, says: &quot;For a scandal with stayingpower, make it mundane -- the sort of everyday transgressionvoters can understand, and resent.&quot; Unlike the complexscandals of BCCI, the Keating Five or Salomon Brothers,Kitegate involves conduct that is part of the experience ofaverage Americans. And unlike John Sununu's travel excesses,the serious abusers in Kitegate number in the dozens.   Members shouldn't kid themselves that they've put Kitegatebehind them by closing the House bank and dumping thecontroversy in the lap of the Ethics Committee. There are alot of unanswered questions. Here are the most pertinent:   -- Is the Ethics Committee the proper investigative body?Majority Leader Richard Gephardt says the bank scandal shows&quot;People want us to be treated like they are.&quot; But onlymembers of Congress have their indiscretions probed by asympathetic peer-review committee, many of whose members havethe same ethical problems. The AP reports that at a meetingof House party whips last week, there was &quot;an audible gasp&quot;when someone suggested that half the ethics panel memberswould have to withdraw from the probe because they hadwritten rubber checks.   Mr. Gephardt says it's up to committee members to decide&quot;if they aren't able to deal with the issue.&quot; Yesterday,committee Chairman Louis Stokes (D., Ohio) bowed out &quot;toavoid any appearance of impropriety.&quot; Since when does theaverage American get to decide his or her own conflicts ofinterest?   -- Will the investigation be thorough? Absolutely not. Theresolution passed by the House asked the Ethics Committee tolook into the bank's practices but doesn't call for anoutside audit. Once abusers are identified, &quot;an inquiryshould be considered&quot; -- but one isn't required. In addition,the bank's records will not be impounded, and the periodcovered by only two General Accounting Office audits will bethe subject of any probe. If a member wrote overdrafts beforemid-1988 or after mid-1990 he is home free.   Bob Michel, the GOP leader, should be ashamed of his keyrole in designing what amounts to a sham inquiry.   -- Does the behavior in Kitegate represent only an ethicalmolehill? Maybe, but maybe not. Some members habitually wrotelarge checks on insufficient funds: In a six-month period in1990, 24 members bounced checks of more than $1,000 at leastonce a month, according to the GAO report. If the Kiting 24didn't report the free interest as income to the IRS, theycould face legal trouble. Also, some members may haveoverdrawn their accounts and invested the money ininterest-bearing accounts to take advantage of the float.&quot;There is obvious corruption on the part of some people,&quot;says Rep. Marge Roukema. The New Jersey Republican is furiousthat the real deadbeats are lying low in hopes the stormblows over.   In addition, it is unclear what legal authority Congresshad to operate a bank that provided interest-free loans,could wire and transfer money, and yet was not subject tofinancial regulation. For instance, the House bank was exemptfrom the federal law that withdrawals of $10,000 or more bereported to the IRS. One House member says the bank wouldhave been a dandy place to hide or launder money.   -- Can we believe those members who say they didn't bounceany checks? Some members clearly aren't fessing up. Newspapersurveys report that some 325 out of 435 members claim theydidn't bounce any checks. Technically, they may be correct.The bank covered their overdrafts and paid the checks,collecting from the members days or weeks later. But theabuse is none the less real. The GAO audit reports that 134members had overdrafts of more than $1,000 at a time in early1990. Members say that some of their colleagues are trying tobrazen it out by denying their bad-check debts. One member,who has admitted to bouncing only one or two checks, is saidto have once been one of the most notorious float artists. Hemight not be caught, though, because the Ethics Committeewill be looking only at two years' worth of bank records.   -- Were the taxpayers on the hook for the bank? Apparentlynot -- at least not directly. Check-kiters took advantage ofthe fact that almost all House members apparently never see agovernment check; their pay is automatically placed in theHouse bank. The bank thus operates like a community chest,with no penalties for members who want to dip in as often asthey like. Irresponsible members took advantage of the largepool of money on deposit there to write bad checks withimpunity. Emma Coleman Jordan, a Georgetown Law bankingspecialist who wrote California's check-kiting law, saysfraud could be involved if some members were involuntarilysubsidizing deadbeat members.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole says the bank did costtaxpayers money. It was subsidized to the tune of well over$1 million a year in office space and staff salaries. &quot;Idon't think the members pay their salaries,&quot; Mr. Dole says.   -- Why did the scandal take so long to surface? Rep. PatRoberts (R., Kan.) says the practice of paying checks withoutbouncing them or charging fees began in the 1950s whenSpeaker Sam Rayburn didn't want the House &quot;embarrassed&quot; bysome member's bounced check.   Over the years, the House bank also acted as a middlemanfor congressmen seeking loans. The bank would do the paperwork needed to secure loans for a member at preferred ratesfrom local banks. The only collateral needed was a signatureguaranteeing that his salary checks were held at the Housebank. The loans ended in the mid-1980s after several membersdefaulted upon leaving office.   Such sloppy practices went unnoticed for so long becausethe periodic GAO audits of the bank weren't public. Congresshas exempted itself from the Freedom of Information Act. In1977, when the Cleveland Plain Dealer asked the Housesergeant-at-arms for access to the audits it was told theirrelease was up to the speaker. The speaker told the paperthat release was up to the sergeant-at-arms.   Since 1984, GAO audits have been available, but they arevery incomplete. The GAO is an arm of Congress, and it isreluctant to offend its bosses. Even the most recent auditwas heavily edited so there is no way of knowing how muchmoney was overdrawn in total. But it could be considerable.In 1988, the GAO found that during a 12-day sample period, &quot;adaily average of 30 checks totaling nearly $18,900 were beingheld due to insufficient funds. These checks had been writtenby more than 90 Members of the House.&quot;   -- What is the speaker's role in Kitegate? A confusingone. Speaker Thomas Foley says he's furious his order toimplement the reforms demanded by GAO in 1989 was ignored.Why was it? Will he fire the sergeant-at-arms who runs thebank?   The speaker also has a credibility problem. Asked if hehad rubber checks at the House bank, Mr. Foley replied: &quot;No,I do my banking at United States Bank in Spokane, Wash.&quot; Hesaid he had an account at the House bank, &quot;but it's notactive.&quot; As recently as last Wednesday, his office denied hehad bounced any checks. The next day he admitted bouncing a$540 check last December. How many checks has the speakerwritten on his &quot;not active&quot; account? The Washington Timescites sources that say that over the years some 30 of hischecks have failed to clear.   Observing the plight of the House and Speaker Foley,senators are relieved they didn't have such a bank to temptthem into trouble. But they came close. In 1988, 11 freshmanDemocrats led by Tim Wirth of Colorado asked that a bank&quot;similar&quot; to the House's be created for senators. The ideawas shelved after Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyomingcalled it &quot;absurd.&quot; &quot;The American people have a hard enoughtime accepting the fact we get free haircuts,&quot; he said. TheHouse didn't realize that until it was too late. The result,says Sen. Dole, is &quot;another nail in the coffin&quot; of Congress'sbattered reputation.   And the biggest boost for term limits their supporterscould have hoped for.   ---   Mr. Fund is a Journal editorial writer.</TEXT></DOC>
