They disappeared neara checkpoint in Beirut run by Christian militiamen.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Bush clearly hopes that his offer will satisfyIran's call for a gesture of thanks from the U.S. for itshelp in winning the release of two Americans held hostage inBeirut. &quot;Here's something we can do&quot; without violating U.S.policy against negotiating for release of hostages, thepresident said.
