Long term is a concept that had been trampled and forgotten byAmerican business. In government, financial crises madeimplementation impossible. At the consumer level it showed up asspending rather than saving.   To change such ingrained attitudes is an enormous challenge, madeeven more difficult by two related symptoms of the recent past: adeterioration of quality, and a tendency of Americans to preferconsumption to production.   Making it easier, however, is the fact that in some respects thechange already is in motion.   A bit of background:   After the easy days of the 1960s, some American industries wentto sleep, assured that they were the best and that it was up toothers to catch them. The ``others,'' such as the Japanese, caughtthem and then outperformed them.   With the pressure on, many U.S. manufacturers sought desperatelyto keep sales and earnings from shrinking by resorting toexpedients. Thinking became short term to meet the immediatechallenge. Quality suffered.   Adding to the pressure was the new attitude on Wall Street, whichstressed immediate profits rather than long-term strength. It madeinvesting for the long term all the more difficult. Traders wantedresults now _ not later.   Runaway inflation worsened things, shortening the focus evenmore. And rising interest rates created an almost impossiblesituation. How could anyone focus on a long term that couldn't beforeseen? Short-term survival was in.   Eventually, American industry and government and individuals hadto face the music. While opportunists and exploiters of thesituation could benefit for the short term, such as by borrowing andrepaying in cheap dollars, the general public and its institutionswere being weakened to collapse.   Faced with the inevitable, industry caught hold of itself, bitthe bullet, took its short-term losses, invested in capitalimprovements whose payoff was years into the future, raised qualityand sought to become more competitive.   For many companies _ automotive concerns, for example _ it paidoff, and once again they are healthy. Higher quality has been builtnot just into physical facilities but into the thinking of workersand executives.   Unions helped, recognizing that the only way to reclaim jobs lostto foreign companies was to restrain wages and cooperate in raisingproductivity. And, as inflation cooled, realistic plans for thefuture could be made again.   The process, though under way, still has a long way to go.   The investing scene has been a notable laggard, with corporateraiders still seeking instant profits versus long-term performance,and brokers urging investors to trade on short-term news rather thaninvesting for the future.   In the consumer area, there is still a tendency to live beyondmeans, as shown by the persistence of installment debt and a savingsrate that remains relatively low. But that too has begun to change,and some analysts forecast a steady increase in savings as theso-called baby-boomer generation ages.   If there is indeed a growing tendency to think longer term today,it seemingly couldn't be hurt by a lift from public policy.   Among other things, Brady would consider lowering the capitalgains tax on long-term investments to just 15 percent, compared with28 percent to 33 percent now, hoping thereby to encourage long-terminvesting.   Pension fund managers, who sit on the largest mound of financialassets in the world, would be encouraged in ways not yet made clearto invest for long-term rewards. And leveraged buyouts would somehowbe curtailed or discouraged.   Whether these particular techniques will work is likely to bedebated vigorously.   But it isn't likely that there'll be much debate about the longterm versus short term issue itself. Those bad old days are stillfresh enough to serve as a warning.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday Feb. 7</NOTE></DOC>
