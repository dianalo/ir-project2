General Authority and Preemption Under the HMTA</ITAG>The HMTA at section 112(a) (49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)) preempts ``* * * anyrequirement, of a State or political subdivision thereof, which is inconsistentwith any requirement set forth in [the HMTA], or in a regulation issuedunder [the HMTA].'' This express preemption provision makes it evidentthat Congress did not intend the HMTA and its regulations to completelyoccupy the field of transportation so as to preclude any state or localaction. The HMTA preempts only those state and local requirements thatare ``inconsistent.''In the HMTA's Declaration of Policy (section 102) and in the Senate CommerceCommittee language reporting out what became section 112 of the HMTA, Congressindicated a desire for uniform national standards in the field of hazardousmaterials transportation. Congress inserted the preemption language insection 112(a) ``in order to preclude a multiplicity of state and localregulations and the potential for varying as well as conflicting regulationsin the area of hazardous material transportation'' (S. Rep. 1192, 93rdCong., 2d Sess., 37 (1974)). Through its enactment of the HMTA, Congressgave the Department the authority to promulgate uniform national standards.While the HMTA did not totally preclude state or local action in this area,Congress intended, to the extent possible, to make such state or localaction unnecessary. The comprehensiveness of the HMR, issued to implementthe HMTA, severely restricts the scope of historically permissible stateor local activity.Although advisory in nature, inconsistency rulings issued by OHMT under49 CFR Part 107 provide an alternative to litigation for a determinationof the relationship between Federal requirements and those of a state orpolitical subdivision. If a state or political subdivision requirementis found to be inconsistent, the state or local government may apply toOHMT for a waiver of preemption. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(b); 49 CFR 107.215-107.225.In issuing its advisory inconsistency rulings concerning preemption underthe HMTA, OHMT is guided by the principles enunciated in Executive Order12612 entitled ``Federalism'' (52 FR 41685, Oct. 30, 1987). Section 4(a)of that Executive Order authorizes preemption of state laws only when theFederal statute contains an express preemption provision, there is otherfirm and palpable evidence of Congressional intent to preempt, or the exerciseof state authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority.The HMTA, of course, contains an express preemption provision, which OHMThas implemented through regulations and interpreted in a long series ofinconsistency rulings beginning in 1978.Since these proceedings are conducted pursuant to the HMTA, only the questionof statutory preemption under the HMTA will be considered. A court mightfind a non-Federal requirement preempted for other reasons, such as statutorypreemption under another Federal statute, preemption under state law, orpreemption by the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because of anundue burden on interstate commerce. However, OHMT does not make such determinationsin an inconsistency ruling proceeding.OHMT has incorporated into its procedures (49 CFR 107.209(c)) the followingcriteria for determining whether a state or local requirement is consistentwith, and thus not preempted by, the HMTA:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Whether compliance with both the non-Federal requirement and theAct or the regulations issued under the Act is possible; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The extent to which the non-Federal requirement is an obstacleto the accomplishment and execution of the Act and the regulations issuedunder the Act.</ITAG>These criteria are based upon, and supported by, U.S. Supreme Court decisionson preemption. These include <T3>Hines </T3>v. <T3>Davidowitz, </T3>312 U.S. 52 (1941); <T3>Florida Lime andamp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </T3>v.<T3> Paul, </T3>373 U.S. 132 (1963); and <T3>Ray </T3>v. <T3>Atlantic Richfield Co.,</T3> 435 U.S. 151 (1978).The first criterion, the ``dual compliance'' test, concerns those non-Federalrequirements which are irreconcilable with Federal requirements; that is,compliance with the non-Federal requirement causes the Federal requirementto be violated, or <T3>vice versa.</T3> The second criterion, the ``obstacle'' test, involvesdetermining whether a state or local requirement is an obstacle to executingand accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA and the HMR; a requirement constitutingsuch an obstacle is inconsistent. Application of this second criterionrequires an analysis of the non-Federal requirement in light of the requirementsof the HMTA and the HMR, as well as the purposes and objectives of Congressin enacting the HMTA and the manner and extent to which those purposesand objectives have been carried out through OHMT's regulatory program.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Application for Inconsistency Ruling</ITAG>On July 25, 1988, Lawrence H. Harmon, Director of the Transportation ManagementDivision, Office of Defense Waste and Transportation Management, U.S. Departmentof Energy (DOE), filed an application on behalf of DOE for an inconsistencyruling. That application specifically requested a finding that certainprovisions of Colorado's regulations implementing the Colorado NuclearMaterials Transportation Act of 1986 (CNMTA) be determined to be inconsistentwith the HMTA and the HMR.DOE alleges that the CNMTA and its implementing regulations apply to carrierstransporting through Colorado highway route controlled quantities of radioactivematerial (HRCQ) as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(1). DOE states that it isthe Federal agency responsible for radioactive materials transportationto which the Colorado regulations pertain under the following applicabilitylanguage:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * radioactive materials being transported to the waste isolationpilot plant in New Mexico and radioactive materials along transported toany facility provided pursuant to section 135 of the federal `Nuclear WastePolicy Act of 1982', 42 U.S.C. 10101, <T3>et seq.,</T3> or any repository licensed by the United States NuclearRegulatory Commission that is used for the permanent, deep, geologic disposalof high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.</ITAG>DOE contends that the Colorado regulations under the CNMTA are inconsistentwith the HMR insofar as they impose information and documentation requirements,classify hazardous materials, impose training requirements, specify permitrequirements and impose penalties and fees.With respect to information and documentation requirements, DOE allegesthat the following Colorado regulations exceed HMR requirements and, therefore,are inconsistent with the HMR:(1) <T3>NT 3(a),</T3> which requires that the telephone number of the ColoradoState Patrol (CSP) be carried with the other shipping papers within thecab of every motor vehicle with instructions to the driver or person incharge of the vehicle to call that number in the event of any incident,accident, or breakdown of equipment;(2) <T3>NT 5(c)(5),</T3> which requires that the original vehicle inspectionreport and any subsequent inspection report shall be retained in the vehiclewhile transporting nuclear materials within the State;(3) <T3>NT 8(f),</T3> which requires that each person transporting nuclearmaterial within the State shall carry in the motor vehicle a copy of anuclear materials transportation permit issued by the Colorado Public UtilitiesCommission.(4) Appendix 8-A to the Colorado rules, which requires that the permitapplicant supply additional information in order to receive a permit, including:(a) A copy of the company's driver training program, which must describepreparation for mountain driving if the route to be traveled is mountainous;(b) Proof that the applicant has obtained liability insurance requiredby Federal rules;(c) A nuclear incident plan that demonstrates applicant's ability to respondto a nuclear incident, which must include provisions for removal of thevehicle and its cargo, prevention or minimization of releases of radioactivity,and decontamination of the environment; and(d) The carrier's plan for replacement or repair of equipment that hasbeen placed out of service by a Port of Entry or State Patrol officer afterinspection or has been inoperative due to mechanical failure or other circumstance.(5) <T3>NT 9,</T3> which contains prenotification requirements in excess ofthose required by the HMR.In addition, DOE asserts that Colorado Rule NT 9 applies the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC) regulation for prenotification of spent fuel shipments,10 CFR 173.73(f), to all HRCQ shipments_instead of the less restrictiveNRC regulation applicable to non-spent fuel HRCQ shipments. The HMR (49CFR 173.22) incorporates the NRC requirements. DOE contends that Rule NT9 thereby establishes a classification of hazardous materials that impermissiblydiffers from that of the HMR.In the area of training, DOE alleges that Appendix 8-A to the Coloradoregulations constitutes an inconsistent training requirement. DOE arguesthat Appendix 8-A's requirement that each permit applicant supply a copyof the company's driver training program, which must describe preparationfor mountain driving if the route to be traveled is mountainous, is inconsistentwith 49 CFR 177.825.Concerning Colorado's permit requirements, DOE argues that they are inconsistentbecause of their extensive information requirements and their vague anddiscretionary standards for determining when a permit may be issued. DOEcites the required submission of a nuclear incident plan that demonstratesthe applicant's ability to respond to a nuclear incident as an exampleof a vague standard for permit issuance. DOE further contends that thepermit requirements ban transportation of HRCQ in compliance with the HMTAand the HMR unless a permit is obtained and create the likelihood of diversionof transportation to other jurisdictions.Finally, DOE contends that the Colorado regulations providing for civilpenalties for violations of the regulations (Rule NT 4) and providing annualand single-trip permit fees (Rules NT 8 (c), (d) and (e)) are inconsistentinsofar as they relate to inconsistent regulations or support an inconsistentpermit system.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>A. GeneralOn August 11, 1988, OHMT published a Public Notice and Invitation to Comment(53 FR 30418) soliciting public comments on DOE's application. Commentsopposing a finding of consistency were filed by the Electric Utility Companies'Nuclear Transportation Group (NTG). Comments favoring a finding of consistencywere filed by the Western Governors' Association (WGA) and the State ofNevada Department of Transportation (Nevada). Rebuttal comments, replyingto the WGA comments, were filed by DOE and NTG.Unfortunately, the State of Colorado (State) has decided not to participatein this proceeding. Instead the State, on September 22, 1988, advised OHMTthat it would not participate because it expected to litigate all relevantissues in Federal court and did not wish to unnecessarily incur legal expenses.Further, the State requested that this inconsistency proceeding be stayedor DOE's petition dismissed. Simultaneously a similar request was sentto the Secretary of Transportation by Senator Tim Wirth and RepresentativesPatricia Schroeder, David Skaggs and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of the ColoradoCongressional Delegation. The basis of their request was that the Statewas pursuing this matter in court.On Octrober 19, 1988, the Secretary of Transportation responded to theSenator and three representatives and declined to direct that this proceedingbe stayed or the DOE petition dismissed. The Secretary's letter set forththe rationale for this decision in the following language:<ITAG tagnum="21">This department's Inconsistency Ruling process provides a forum fordiffering views on the consistency of State and local requirements withthe Federal HMTA and concomitant regulations. The DOT, which has been designatedas the responsible government agency to administer the HMTA, is knowledgeableconcerning the competing interests of the parties and committed to carryingout the intent of Congress in issuing these advisory opinions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Twenty-four advisory Inconsistency Rulings have been issued in thepast decade. These rulings provide a consistent, precedential body of opinionswhich have been deemed helpful to courts, State and local governments,the transportation industry and other parties interested in HMTA preemptionissues. It is not unusual for a court case to be pending while an InconsistencyRuling application is filed. In fact, several Inconsistency Rulings havebeen issued while cases were pending in court. Moreover, in these casesthe courts considered the Department's views before rendering their decisions.It has long been the Department's policy to rule on petitions (such asDOE's) in a timely manner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this instance, DOE has petitioned the Department and, consistentwith prior policy and practice, we intend to issue a decision in a timelymanner. In fact, should the DOT ruling be rendered prior to the Court'sconsideration of the case, it may be helpful to the Federal Judge determiningHMTA preemption issues.</ITAG>Thereafter, on October 31, 1988, I responded to the September 22 letterfrom the State and denied its request that the DOE application be dismissedor this inconsistency proceeding be stayed.B. Comments Supporting ConsistencyThe Western Governors' Association (WGA) submitted substantive commentssupporting the consistency of the CNMTA and the Colorado PUC's implementingregulations. Nevada's comment merely endorsed the WGA comments.WGA cites language in the CNMTA, stating that the PUC regulations thereunder``shall not be inconsistent with any Federal rule or regulation'' regardingnuclear materials transportation, as evidence that the CNMTA is consistentwith the HMTA.WGA states that section 105 of the CNMTA authorizes the PUC to adopt rulesfor ``the safe transportation of nuclear materials by motor vehicle'' andargues that a similar law was found consistent with the HMTA in InconsistencyRuling No. IR-12 (IR-12), 49 FR 46650 (Nov. 27, 1984).With respect to requirements for inspections under section 106 of the CNMTAand PUC Rule NT 5, WGA contends that such requirements are consistent becausethe inspections are conducted to determine compliance with the HMR andFederal motor carrier safety rules. It cites several inconsistency rulingsfor the proposition that state inspections for compliance with Federalregulations and consistent state regulations are a valid exercise of statepolice power. IR-2, 43 FR 75566 (Dec. 20, 1979), <T3>appeal</T3>, 45 FR 71881 (Oct. 30, 1980), <T3>correction</T3>, 45 FR 76838 (Nov. 20, 1980); IR-8, 49 FR 46637 (Nov.27, 1984), <T3>appeal</T3>, 52 FR 13000 (Apr. 20, 1987); IR-15, 49 FR 46660 (Nov.27, 1984), <T3>appeal</T3>, 52 FR 13062 (Apr. 20, 1987); IR-17, 51 FR 20925 (June9, 1986), <T3>appeal</T3>, 52 FR 36200 (Sept. 25, 1987), <T3>correction</T3>, 52 FR 37399 (Oct. 6, 1987). WGA quotes the followinglanguage from IR-8:<ITAG tagnum="21">Far from being an obstacle to the accomplishment of the HMTA, Stateenforcement of Federal and consistent State regulations concerning hazardousmaterials transportation safety is a critical element of a regulatory systemof national applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">49 FR 46644.Similarly, WGA asserts that PUC Rule NT 6, stating that a vehicle, driveror cargo can be placed out-of-service for violations of the HMR or Federalmotor carrier safety regulations, is consistent with the HMTA. It allegesthat no vehicles in compliance with Federal laws are denied entry to theState. WGA states that IR-17, <T3>supra</T3>, held that restricting shipments that are in violation ofFederal safety laws ``is precisely the sort of state action which the draftersof the HMTA intended and which the [U.S. DOT] endorses as sound enforcementpolicy.'' In summary, WGA argues that the State's inspections are to enforceFederal regulations and thus are consistent with the HMTA.As to civil and criminal penalties under sections 107-109 of the CNMTA,WGA states that they are valid tools for enforcing Federal and consistentstate regulations, are neither extreme nor arbitrary, and thus are consistent.WGA cites IR-3, 46 FR 76838 (Mar. 26, 1981), <T3>appeal</T3>, 47 FR 18457 (Apr. 29, 1982), for the proposition thata mere difference in penalty provisions between state and Federal penaltiesis not a basis for finding inconsistency.The final issue addressed by WGA is the State's shipment fees under section202 of the CNMTA and PUC Rule NT-8. WGA contests DOE's assertion that theshipment fees are inconsistent because they support an inconsistent permitsystem. WGA says that the system and the fees are not inextricably linked.WGA states:<ITAG tagnum="21">When the merits of the fee are examined separately, the fee is foundto be consistent with federal law in that: the fee does not delay the transportationof nuclear materials in interstate commerce; no evidence was introducedthat the fee results in rerouting to avoid Colorado; the fee is used tocompensate the state for the reasonable costs imposed by the transportationof nuclear materials within the state's borders; and there is no evidencepresented showing that the size of the fee is disproportionate to the costsimposed upon the state.</ITAG>WGA also points to the flexibility concerning alternate means of paymentof the shipping fees: (1) Seven days in advance by mail, (2) at the timeand place of entering the State, or (3) by monthly payments when carriersare making regular shipments. It also points to the deposit of the fundsin a nuclear materials transportation fund (section 212 of the CNMTA) andtheir subsequent use to finance the costs of administering the CNMTA, includinginspections (section 106), enforcement of Federal rules (sections 107-110),and preparation for nuclear incidents (section 102). WGA contends thatall these activities are valid exercises of state police power consistentwith the HMTA.Furthermore, WGA distinguishes an earlier inconsistency ruling, IR-15,<T3>supra</T3>, in which a similar fee was found inconsistent:<ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, unlike the Vermont fee which was found inconsistent byDOT in IR-15, the Colorado fee is not being used to support state programsthat unnecessarily duplicate federal resources. In that case Vermont choseto ignore federal emergency response resources. Colorado has fully availeditself of the emergency response training offered by DOE for future shipmentsof transuranic waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New MexicoUnder PUC Rule NT-5, Colorado's inspection program is required to be operatedin accordance with the standards developed by the Commercial Vehicle SafetyAlliance_further evidence that Colorado is aware of other transportationresources and is fully coordinating its nuclear materials transportationsafety program with these resources.</ITAG>WGA concludes its comments by urging that the Colorado Act and PUC regulationsbe found consistent with the HMTA because they supplement, rather thansupplant, the HMR.C. Comments Opposing Consistency NTG filed extensive comments and rebuttal comments contending that severalprovisions of the CNMTA and corresponding PUC regulations are inconsistentwith the HMTA and the HMR under the ``obstacle'' test. It stresses thesignificance of this inconsistency ruling because of its probable precedentialeffect on states' regulation of HRCQ shipments to DOE's Waste IsolationPilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico and later HRCQ shipments to a permanentrepository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended by theNuclear Waste Policy Amendments of 1987 (NWPA), 42 U.S.C. 10101. NTG specifically alleges that the State is imposing inconsistent requirementswith respect to permitting, information and documentation, and prenotificationand enforcing them with inconsistent penalty provisions. Concerning the permitting issue, NTG quotes PUC Rule NT 8: ``No carriershall transport nuclear materials into, within, through, or out of theState of Colorado until a permit authorizing such transportation has beenissued by the CPUC or its designee.'' It explains that NT 8 imposes a $500annual permit fee and a $200 per shipment fee. It also states that thepermit application requires the applicant's driver training program, proof-of-insurance,a nuclear incident clean-up plan, and a plan for replacement or repairof equipment when required. NTG cites IR-18, 52 FR 200 (Jan. 2, 1987), <T3>appeal </T3>53 FR 28850 (July 29, 1988), for the proposition that stateand local permit requirements for the transportation of radioactive materialsgenerally are inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR. It also contendsthat IR-18 supports an inconsistency finding in this instance because Coloradorequires more information than the HMR and because its CNMTA provides nopermit processing period. NTG advances separate arguments against the consistency of each of threeof the permit application provisions. It cites IR-2, <T3>supra; </T3>IR-18, <T3>supra; </T3>IR-19, 52 FR 24404 (June 30, 1987), <T3>correction </T3>52 FR 29468 (Aug. 7, 1987), <T3>appeal</T3> 53 FR 11600 (Apr. 7, 1988), for the proposition that emergencyresponse is a state and local responsibility and that an emergency responseplan cannot be required of a carrier. It argues that requiring proof ofinsurance is inconsistent under IR-2, IR-8, IR-8(Appeal); IR-15, IR-15(Appeal),and IR-19, all <T3>supra. </T3>It further contends that requiring submission of a drivertraining program is inconsistent with andSection;177.825 of the HMR and citesIR-8(Appeal) as authority for that proposition. After concluding that the CNMTA permit requirements, as a whole, are inconsistentunder the ``obstacle'' test, NTG argues that, under IR-15, IR-17, and IR-17(Appeal),all <T3>supra, </T3>the permit fees are inconsistent because they are designedto fund or are related to an inconsistent state regulatory program. In addition, NTG asserts that requirements to carry in the cab a ColoradoState Patrol phone number with calling instructions (Rule NT 3), to carrya copy of the permit (Rule NT 8(f)), and to carry vehicle inspection reportswhich exceed Federal requirements and thus are inconsistent under IR-8(Appeal),<T3>supra.</T3> Concerning the State's prenotification requirements, NTG alleges that RuleNT 9 fails to maintain the Federal differentiation (10 CFR 71.97 and 73.37(f))between spent fuel shipments and other HRCQ shipments. In addition, itasserts that the information required under Rule NT 9 differs from thatrequired by 10 CFR 71.97 and, therefore, is <T3>per se </T3>inconsistent under IR-14, 49 FR 46656 (Nov. 27, 1984);IR-15, <T3>supra; </T3>IR-16, 50 FR 20872 (May 20, 1985) and IR-18, <T3>supra.</T3> Concerning the civil penalty provisions of Rule NT 4, NTG contends thatthose provisions are inconsistent to the extent that any provisions ofthe CNMTA are found inconsistent. In support of that assertion, it citesIR-18, <T3>supra,</T3> and <T3>Jersey Central Power andamp; Light Co. </T3>v. <T3>Township of Lacey</T3>, 772 F.2d 1103 (3d Cir. 1985). In summary, NTG asserts that the following Colorado rules and the correspondingCNMTA provisions are inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR under the obstacletest:<ITAG tagnum="15">NT 3(a)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NT 5(c)(5)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NT 8 and Appendix 8-A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NT 9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NT 4 (as applied to the above provisions).</ITAG>NTG also filed reply comments to the WGA comments. It asserts that DOE'sapplication for this inconsistency ruling fosters a cooperative Federal-staterelationship more effectively than litigation. It points out that WGA addressedonly three aspects of the CNMTA, inspections, penalties and shipment fees,and argues that DOT may conclude that the WGA does not take issue withDOE and NTG arguments concerning the alleged inconsistency of many otherCNMTA provisions. It also contends that the CNMTA language declaring thatimplementing regulations ``shall not be inconsistent with any federal ruleor regulation'' cannot prevent a full examination of the State's requirementsto determine their consistency.In response to WGA's discussion of the CNMTA's inspection provisions, NTGpoints out that DOE did not seek a ruling on the consistency of those provisions.Thus, NTG takes no position on those inspection provisions.NTG agrees with WGA's statement that reasonable penalty provisions forenforcing consistent state requirements are themselves consistent. However,NTG points to the State PSC's ability to impose fines of up to $10,000per day for a continuing violation, argues that this amount could be extremelyexcessive, and concludes that the State's failure to explain its derivationor assessment of penalties would justify OHMT in assuming that maximumpenalties would be assessed when it determines the reasonableness of theState's penalties. Concerning shipment fees, NTG disagrees with the WGA assertion that thefees are not inextricably linked to the permit system. It says that section40-2.2-202 of the CNMTA ties the two together and that the fees are designed,in part, to fund the permitting program. It states that Colorado has notprovided detail on the use of the fees, that prior inconsistency rulingsresult in very limited areas for state and local transportation requirementsfor radioactive materials transportation, and disagrees with WGA's contentionthat parties challenging the fees' consistency have the burden of proof(given the virtually complete occupation of the field of radioactive materialstransportation by the HMTA and the HMR). Finally, NTG cites language inIR-17 (Appeal), <T3>supra,</T3> indicating that fees, such as those involved in IR-15,<T3>supra</T3>, associated with inconsistent permitting systems themselvesare inconsistent. DOE also submitted comments responding to those of WGA. DOE describes itscooperative effort with states concerning its radioactive materials transportation.It cites an Office of Technology Assessment Report indicating that NRCspecifications used for HRCQ shipments provide a very high level of publicprotection_ ``much greater than that afforded in any other current hazardousmaterials shipping activity.'' In light of that finding, DOE argues thatColorado has no rational safety basis for its $500 permit fee per vehicleand $200 per shipment fee for HRCQ shipments when its recently-promulgatedfee schedule for other hazardous materials transported by motor vehicleprovides for no per shipment fee and for annual fees as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10</C> <H1>No. of vehicles</H1><H1>Fees</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1-5<D>$10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6-10<D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11-50<D>125</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51-100<D>200</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101-300<D>350</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Over 300<D>400</D></ITAG></ITAG> Concerning the issue of inspection provisions, DOE states that its applicationdid not raise the issue of the consistency of those provisions. Concerning the penalty provisions, DOE states that it objects only to theimposition of penalties insofar as they apply to violations of inconsistentrules. Concerning the State's permit and fee requirements, DOE disagrees withWGA's comments that the permit and fees are separable and that the feesdo not cause delay or support an inconsistent program. DOE argues as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The fee and permit are not separable. Colorado rule NT-8 addressespermit requirements and NT-8(c) is entitled ``permit fees''. No permitcan be obtained without payment of an annual permit fee of $500. NT-8(d)imposes a $200 per shipment fee in addition to the annual permit fee. Ifa carrier entering the State does not have a permit, a single-trip permitmay be obtained pursuant to NT-8(e). But NT-8(e) provides that the singletrip fee ``shall be the same as indicated in NT-8 (c) and (d) here.'' Thus,based on the clear and explicit language of the Colorado rules, the annual,per shipment, and single trip permits are inextricably linked to fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The WGA claims that since the fee can be paid seven days in advanceby mail, and since single shipment permits can be obtained, no delay inshipment will result. There are two flaws in this reasoning. First, inorder to obtain a permit, information additional to that required by thefederal rules must be supplied (Appendix 8-A to the Colorado regulations)and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission has broad discretion in determiningwhether the permit requirements have been met. There is no deadline bywhich Colorado must respond to a permit applicant. Therefore, significantdelay in awaiting permit approval easily could occur. Secondly, the singletrip permit may be obtained only if the carrier can provide $700. If thecarrier cannot provide $700, and transports nonetheless, the carrier issubject to both civil penalties (NT-4) and criminal penalties (ColoradoRevised Statutes, 40-2.2-107).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The obvious result of such a system is redirection of shipments awayfrom Colorado whenever possible. As recognized in IR-15, such diversionwould reduce the State's exposure to the risk of HRCQ transportation atthe expense of neighboring jurisdictions. If other jurisdictions followsuit and enact a similar permit and fee system, ``[t]he proliferation ofescalating fees, as States sought to finance elaborate response systemsand/or to reduce their exposure to radioactive materials transportation,would amount to a system of internal tariff barriers which would completelyundermine HM-164 [the federal regulation] . . . ''. IR-15, 49 FR 46664(November 27, 1984).</ITAG>DOE concludes that the State's permitting system is inconsistent with theHMTA and the HMR under the ``obstacle'' test and constitutes a prohibitedrouting rule under Appendix A to 49 CFR Part 177 because it would createunnecessary delays.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Ruling</ITAG>A. Inspection RequirementsWGA's comments focused on the desirability of states' carrying out effectivehazardous materials transportation inspection programs. DOE, however, hasnot challenged any of the State's inspection requirements in its inconsistencyruling application.It is clear, nevertheless, that state inspection requirements relatingto Federal and consistent state requirements are encouraged by OHMT andare consistent with the HMTA and the HMR. IR-2, IR-8, IR-15, IR-17, all<T3>supra</T3>; IR-20, 52 FR 24396 (June 30, 1987), <T3>correction</T3>, 52 FR 29468 (Aug. 7, 1987). On the other hand, stateinspection requirements relating to inconsistent requirements are themselvesinconsistent. IR-20, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-21, 52 FR 37072 (Oct. 2, 1987); <T3>appeal</T3>, 53 FR 46735 (Nov. 18, 1988).Accordingly, the State's inspection requirements (Colorado PUC Rules NT5 and 6) generally are consistent to the extent, but only to the extent,they relate to Federal and consistent State requirements. (But see discussionbelow of Rule NT 5(c)(5).)B. Information and Documentation RequirementsDOE's application contains unrebutted assertions that the following Stateinformation and documentation requirements exceed HMR requirements andthus are inconsistent:(1) <T3>NT 3(a)</T3>, which requires that the telephone number of the ColoradoState Patrol (CSP) be carried with the other shipping papers within thecab of every motor vehicle with instructions to the driver or person incharge of the vehicle to call that number in the event of any incident,accident, or breakdown of equipment;(2) <T3>NT 5(c)(5)</T3>, which requires that the original vehicle inspectionreport and any subsequent inspection report shall be retained in the vehiclewhile transporting nuclear materials within the State;(3) <T3>NT 8(f)</T3>, which requires that each person transporting nuclearmaterial within the State shall carry in the motor vehicle a copy of anuclear materials transportation permit issued by the Colorado Public UtilitiesCommission.(4) <T3>Appendix 8-A</T3> to the CPUC rules, which requires that the permitapplicant supply additional information in order to obtain a permit, including:(a) a copy of the company's driver training program, which must describepreparation for mountain driving if the route to be traveled is mountainous;(b) proof that the applicant has obtained liability insurance requiredby Federal rules;(c) a nuclear incident plan that demonstrates applicant's ability to respondto a nuclear incident, which must include provisions for removal of thevehicle and its cargo, prevention or minimization of releases of radioactivity,and decontamination of the environment; and(d) the carrier's plan for replacement or repair of equipment that hasbeen placed out of service by a Port of Entry or State Patrol officer afterinspection or has been inoperative due to mechanical failure or other circumstance.(5) <T3>NT 9, </T3>which allegedly contains prenotification requirements inexcess of those required by the HMR.All of the above information, in fact, is in excess of that required bythe HMR, including that required by Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)regulations incorporated into the HMR by 49 CFR 173.22.Requirements for information or documentation in excess of the HMR createpotential delay, constitute an obstacle to execution of the HMTA and theHMR, and thus are inconsistent. IR-6, 48 FR 760 (Jan. 6, 1983); IR-2, IR-6,IR-8, IR-8(Appeal), IR-15, IR-15(Appeal), IR-18, IR-18(Appeal), IR-19,IRA-19(Appeal), IR-21, all <T3>supra; Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>City of Missoula, </T3>CV 80-18-M (D. Mont. 1984). Also, there is no<T3>de minimis </T3>exception to the ``obstacle'' test for such requirementsbecause thousands of jurisdictions could impose <T3>de minimis </T3>information requirements.These principles are particularly applicable with respect to the intenselyregulated field of radioactive materials transportation. RSPA's Administratorconsidered such requirements in that context in IR-8(Appeal), <T3>supra:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">DOT and NRC have determined what information and documentation requirementsare needed for the safe transportation of radioactive materials, and stateand local requirements going beyond them create confusion, impose burdenson transporters, are obstacles to the accomplishment of the HMTA's objectives,and thus are inconsistent.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">52 FR 13004; see also IR-15(Appeal), <T3>supra.</T3>State and local radioactive materials transportation information and documentationrequirements which have been found inconsistent with the HMR include thefollowing: Emergency response information requirements; multiple submissionsof the same information (e.g., submission to states of NRC approvals andlicenses); transportation route plans; shipment-specific information; andinformation on possible alternate routes, proposed means of conveyance,estimated date and time of departure, emergency response and recovery plans,attestations concerning safety inspections, and certification of compliancewith laws and regulations (the latter being the same as required on DOTshipping papers). IR-8, IR-8(Appeal), IR-15, IR-15(Appeal), IR-19, all<T3>supra. </T3>In summary, the field of radioactive materials transportation informationand documentation requirements has been preempted by the Federal Government(RSPA and NRC, with the latter's requirements having been incorporatedinto the former's HMR). Therefore, the State's information and documentationrequirements identified by DOE fail the ``obstacle'' test and are inconsistentwith the HMTA and the HMR.With respect to some of the areas addressed by its information requirements,however, the State may have other consistent regulatory tools at its disposal.For example, it may accident/incident reports for emergency response purposes.IR-2, <T3>supra; </T3>IR-3, <T3>supra; National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Burke, </T3>535 F. Supp. 509 (D.R.I. 1982), <T3>aff'd </T3>698 F.2d 559 (1st Cir. 1983); 49 CFR Part 177, AppendixA. In summary, RSPA has determined that current information and documentationrequirements concerning radioactive materials transportation are sufficientto meet the needs of safe transportation. However, should RSPA, throughits own initiative or in response to an appropriate petition for rulemaking,decide that those requirements should be enhanced, RSPA will undertakeappropriate rulemaking.C. Prenotification RequirementsDOE contends that Colorado Rule NT 9 applies the NRC regulation for prenotificationof spent fuel shipments, 10 CFR 173.73(f), to all HRCQ shipments, not justspent fuel shipments. As to non-spent fuel HRCQ shipments, therefore, theState requires greater prenotification than the NRC regulations, whichare incorporated into the HMR by 49 CFR 173.22.DOE's objection to the State's prenotification requirement (in additionto the above-discussed informational requirement objection) is that thisrequirement creates a classification of hazardous materials impermissiblydifferent from the HMR. However, it is not necessary to discuss the classificationissue in order to determine the consistency of the State's prenotificationrequirement.Local requirements for advance notice of hazardous materials transportationhave the potential to delay and redirect traffic and thus are inconsistent.IR-6, <T3>supra. </T3>Although state notice requirements concerning radioactivematerials shipment schedule changes identical to NRC requirements are consistent(IR-8, <T3>supra</T3>), notice requirements concerning schedules or schedule changesfor such shipments different from NRC requirements are inconsistent. IR-8(Appeal),IR-14, IR-15, IR-16, IR-18, IR-18(Appeal), <T3>Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>City of Missoula, </T3>all <T3>supra.</T3>OHMT's total occupation of the prenotification field was explicitly statedin IR-8(Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>:<ITAG tagnum="21">Through its rulemaking process and related studies, DOT has determinedwhat prenotification (including information, documentation and certification)requirements are necessary for the safe transportation of radioactive materials.In the process of analyzing rulemaking comments and studies it has commissionedor examined, DOT has determined what prenotification requirements are notnecessary. This field has been totally occupied by the HMR. State and localprovisions either authorizing less prenotification or requiring greaterprenotification than the HMR, therefore, constitute obstacles to the accomplishmentand execution of the objectives of the HMTA and the HMR, are inconsistent,and are preempted.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">52 FR at 13005. The State's prenotification requirements differ from, and are more burdensomethan, the radioactive materials prenotification requirements in andSection;andSection;173.22 and 177.825 of the HMR and 10 CFR 71.97 and 73.97 (NRC regulationsincorporated by reference in andSection; 173.22 of the HMR). CPUC Rule NT9 requires more information about more shipments and thereby creates confusionand undermines the likelihood of proper compliance with the HMR prenotificationrequirements. Therefore, the State's Rule NT 9 is inconsistent with the HMR to the extentthat it exceeds NRC requirements by requiring greater prenotification concerningnon-spent fuel HRCQ radioactive materials shipments. D. Training Requirements DOE contends that Appendix 8-A (Application for Permit) to the Coloradoregulations constitutes an inconsistent training requirement insofar asit requires a motor carrier training program describing preparation formountain driving where a mountainous route is to be used. Again, this particular topic previously was addressed by RSPA's Administrator:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the Department, through promulgation of 49 CFR andSection; 177.825,has established a near total occupation of the field of training requirementsrelating to the transportation of radioactive materials. Thus, state andlocal radioactive materials transportation * * * training requirementsother than * * * those identical to Federal requirements * * * are verylikely to be inconsistent and thus preempted under andSection; 112(a) ofthe HMTA.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IR-8(Appeal)), <T3>supra, </T3>at 13003. Although Colorado, being a mountainous state, understandably may wish torequire motor carrier training for mountain driving, its imposition ofsuch a requirement on transporters of certain radioactive materials constitutesan obstacle to implementation of the HMTA and the HMR. Many other mountainousstates or localities may wish to impose similar requirements, and statesor localities with other geograpical characteristics (e.g., desert) maywish to impose training requirements tailored to those conditions. Suchrequirements, when applied to drivers of motor vehicles carrying radioactivematerials, would be inconsistent. State or local governments, like Colorado, wanting to impose such requirementshave two options available to them. First, they may file a rulemaking petitionwith OHMT or the NRC requesting that the HMR or the NRC regulations beamended to impose such a requirement. Second, they may apply to OHMT, under9 CFR 107.215, for a non-preemption determination (i.e., a waiver of preemption).Any such applications will be given full consideration by DOT. In summary, the requirement in Appendix 8-A to the Colorado regulationsrequiring a training program for motor carriers of certain radioactivematerials fails the ``obstacle'' test and thus is inconsistent with theHMTA and the HMR.E. Permit RequirementsDOE contends that the State's permit requirements (Rule NT 8(a) and (b)and Appendix 8-A to the Rules) are inconsistent because: (1) They ban transportationwithout a permit of HRCQ shipments which are in compliance with the HMTAand the HMR, (2) create the likelihood of diversion of transportation toother jurisdictions, (3) include extensive information requirements, and(4) contain vague and discretionary standards for determining when a permitwill be issued (e.g., the required submission of a nuclear incident plandemonstrating the applicant's ability to respond to a nuclear incident).DOE's contention is correct for all of the reasons cited. Generally, state or local hazardous materials transportation permits <T3>per se</T3> are not inconsistent, and their consistency depends upontheir specific requirements. IR-2, IR-3, IR-20, all <T3>supra.</T3> However, because the field of radioactive materials transportationsafety is so intensively regulated and almost completely occupied by theHMTA and the HMR, state and local requirements are limited to : (1) Trafficcontrol or restrictions applying to all traffic, (2) designation of preferredroutes under 49 CFR 177.825, (3) adoption of Federal or consistent requirements,(4) enforcement of consistent requirements or those for which preemptionhas been waived, and (5) imposition of reasonable transit fees to financethose enforcement activities and emergency response preparedness. Thus,radioactive materials transportation permits generally are inconsistent.IR-8; IR-8(Appeal); IR-10; IR-11; IR-12; IR-13; IR-15; IR-18; IR-18(Appeal);IR-19; IR-19(Appeal); IR-20; IR-21; IR-21(Appeal), all <T3>supra.</T3> The permit system at issue here has many similarities to the Nevada permitsystem (applicable to radioactive and explosive materials) found inconsistentin IR-19 and IR-19 (Appeal), both <T3>supra.</T3> Like that system, Colorado's permit system prohibits certaintransportation without a permit regardless of whether that transportationis in compliance with the HMTA and the HMR, applies to selected hazardousmaterials, involves extensive information and documentation requirements,and contains considerable discretion concerning permit issuance. As wasstated in IR-19, ``Cumulatively, these factors constitute unauthorizedprior restraints in shipments of * * *  hazardous materials that are presumptivelysafe based on their compliance with Federal regulations.'' 52 FR at 24407.The quoted language was applied in IR-19 to permits for <T3>nonradioactive</T3> hazardous materials transportation, a field which,unlike <T3>radioactive</T3> hazardous materials transportation, has not been virtuallycompletely ocupied by the HMR. I am aware of a contrary view concerning the Nevada permitting system atissue in IR-19 and IR-19(Appeal), that is, a four-page unpublished U.S.District Court opinion upholding the consistency of that system. <T3>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </T3>v. <T3>Public Service Commission of Nevada,</T3> CV-N-86-444-BRT (D. Nev.1988). That Court cited no judicial or other precedent for it conclusions,did not fully address the issues discussed in the two DOT opinions, anddid not discuss or apply the two-pronged test for consistency set forthin 49 CFR 107.209(c). Thus, I do not find that decision persuasive in consideringthe consistency of the Colorado permit system with the HMTA and the HRM.For the foregoing reasons, CPUC NT 8(a) and (b) and Appendix 8-A to theCPUC Rules are inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR. F. Civil Penalties DOE contends that CPUC Rule NT 4, providing for civil penalties for violationsof the CPUC regulations, is consistent insofar as if relates to inconsistentregulations. NTG supports that contention and also argues that civil penaltiesimposed under the Rule could be excessive. Civil penalties for violations of consistent state or local hazardous materialstransportation laws or regulations are consistent with the HMTA and theHMR unless they are so extreme or arbitrarily applied as to cause the reroutingor unreasonable delay of shipments. Mere differences in amount do not requirea finding of inconsistency. IR-3, <T3>supra.</T3> However, civil penalties for violations of inconsistentstate or local hazardous materials transportation laws or regulations arethemselves inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR under the ``obstacle''test. IR-18, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-18(Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>; <T3>Jersey Central Power andamp; Light Co. </T3>v. <T3>Township of Lacey.</T3> 772 F.2d 1103 (3rd Cir. 1985). Therefore, CPUC Rule NT 4 is consistent with the HMTA and the HMR insofaras it applies to violations of inconsistent CPUC regulations. The civilpenalties under CPUC Rule NT 4 which are similar in amount to those underthe MHTA and the HMR, have not been demonstrated to be so arbitrary orexcessive as to cause diversion or significant delays of hazardous materialstransportation. Therefore, CPUC Rule NT 4 is consistent with the HMTA andthe HMR insofar as it applies to violations of consistent CPUC regulations;otherwise it is inconsistent. G. Fee RequirementsDOE contends that the State's permit fees and shipment fees (CPUC RulesNT 8(c), (d) and (e)) are inconsistent because they support an inconsistentpermit system and discriminate against radioactive materials_as comparedto other hazardous materials.Reasonable state or local fees on hazardous materials transportation tofund consistent governmental activities are consistent with the HMTA andthe HMR. IR-17, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-17 (Appeal), <T3>supra; New Hampshire Motor Transport Assn. </T3>v. <T3>Flynn</T3>, 751 F.2d 43 (1st Cir. 1984). However, state or local feeswhich are unreasonably high or are related to inconsistent governmentalactivities are inconsistent. IR-11, 49 FR 46647 (Nov. 27, 1984); IR-13,49 FR 46653 (Nov. 27, 1984); IR-15, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-18 (Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>; IR-19, <T3>supra; New Hampshire Motor Transport Assn. </T3>v. <T3>Flynn, supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Permit Fees</ITAG>Under these standards, the State's ``permit fee'' (Rule NT 8(c)) and thefirst seven words of NT 8(d) is similar to Vermont's $1,000 fee for spentnuclear fuel shipments found inconsistent in IR-15, <T3>supra</T3>, and is itself inconsistent because it represents paymentfor a permit which has been determined elsewhere in this ruling to be inconsistent.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Shipment Fees</ITAG>The ``shipment fees'' in CPUC Rules NT 8(d) (except for the first sevenwords thereof) and NT 8(e), however, are more similar to Illinois' $1,000per cask fee for spent nuclear fuel transportation to fund inspection,enforcement, state escorts and emergency response, none of which was relatedto inconsistent provisions or caused diversions or significant transportationdelays. The Illinois fee was found consistent in IR-17 and IR-17 (Appeal),both <T3>supra</T3>. Colorado's shipment fees, although larger, also are similarto New Hampshire's $25/year or $15/trip fee for hazardous materials transportation,used to fund transportation and environmental programs and related to aminimal delay licensing system, which fee was found consistent in <T3>New Hampshire Motor Transport Assn. </T3>v. <T3>Flynn, </T3>supra.There is no showing on the record in this matter that the CPUC Rule NT8 (d) and (e) shipment fees are related to inconsistent state activitiesor cause diversion or unreasonable delays of hazardous materials transportation.Based on this record, therefore, they are consistent with the HMTA andthe HMR.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Summary</ITAG>Many of the State's requirements are inconsistent with the uniform nationwideregulation of hazardous materials transportation contemplated by the HMTAand the HMR and thus have been found inconsistent herein.To the extent the State believes that certain of its requirements are appropriatefor nationwide application, it may file petitions for rulemaking with RSPA(49 CFR 106.31) or the NRC. To the extent it believes that certain of itsrequirements are appropriate for application within Colorado, it may applyfor a non-preemption determination (waiver of preemption) under 49 CFR107.215.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Ruling</ITAG>For the foregoing reasons and based on the record in this matter, I makethe following findings. No opinion is rendered concerning the consistencyof any provisions of Colorado's Nuclear Materials Transportation Act of1986 (CNMTA), C.R.S. section 40-2.2-101 <T3>et seq</T3>. Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) RegulationsNT 3(a), 5(c)(5), 8(a), 8(b), 8(c) and 8(f); the first seven words of CPUCRegulation NT 8(d); and Appendix 8-A to the CPUC Regulations are inconsistentwith the HMTA and the HMR. CPUC Regulations NT 4, 5 (except for 5(c)(5))and 6 are consistent to the extent they relate to other consistent requirements;otherwise they are inconsistent. CPUC Regulation NT 9 is inconsistent tothe extent it requires different or more prenotifications than the HMR.CPUC Regulation NT 8(d), except for its first seven words, and CPUC RegulationNT 8(e) are consistent with the HMTA and the HMR. No opinion is renderedconcerning the consistency of any other CPUC regulations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Any appeal of this ruling must be filed within 30 days of servicein accordance with 49 CFR 107.211.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alan I.
