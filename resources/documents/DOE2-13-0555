<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0555 </DOCNO><TEXT>This VDI guideline can be adduced for solving the following questions:recording and analysing the actual conditions in a 'building heatingsupply' system; elaborating proposals for improvements and calculationof their effects on energy economy; comparing components with due regardfor legally prescribed minimum requirements and the best results in relationto state of the art. After introductory explanations of the pertinentregulations, standards, guidelines and terminology, details are givenon: the calculation of the annual fuel consumption; assessment of heatgenerator with amount of usable heat produced at nominal power; assessmentof heat generator excluding usable heat output; approximation methodfor determining the building's heating requirement; calculation of hoursof full use of the building; calculation of annual rate of usage; degreeof spread of usage; improvement of evaluation of regulation and controlefficiency; selection of nominal thermal output for heat generator; influenceof adjustment of the heating system on changes in usable heat; correctionof annual fuel consumption; calculation examples.
