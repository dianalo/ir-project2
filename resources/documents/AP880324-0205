McFarlane, who declined to comment during a break in the grandjury proceedings, became involved in the pipeline project in thespring and summer of 1985 through contacts with Meese, longtimeMeese friend E. Robert Wallach and Wallach's client, Swiss oilmanBruce Rappaport.   McFarlane was accompanied to the federal courthouse by legalcounsel, Peter Morgan, who said his client is a witness in thegrand jury investigation.   Independent counsel James McKay is investigating whether Meesemay have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connectionwith the pipeline project.   In a September 1985 memo to Meese relating Wallach'sconversations with Rappaport, Wallach said a portion of up to $700million from the pipeline would be paid to the Israeli Labor Partyof then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.   Meese has said he doesn't recall reading the reference to LaborParty payments in the memo, which was found in the attorneygeneral's files at the Justice Department last year in connectionwith McKay's investigation.   McKay is presenting evidence to the grand jury in an attempt todetermine whether there was a conspiracy to pay bribes to Israelipoliticians to ensure that Israel would not bomb the pipelinepassing through Iraq and Jordan close to the Israeli border.Rappaport has denied making or offering bribes, and denies thatthere was any plan to do so.   Wallach went to Meese for help on the pipeline in May 1985 andthe attorney general referred him to McFarlane, who then wasPresident Reagan's national security adviser.   The referral resulted in a meeting in June 1985 betweenMcFarlane, Wallach and Rappaport.   The pipeline's backers wanted to enlist the support of the U.S.government in assembling an insurance package that would protectthe project in the event of an Israeli attack.   On March 11 in connection with the Iran-Contra arms and moneyaffair, McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that hemisled Congress in 1985 by assuring lawmakers the Reaganadministration was not helping arm Nicaraguan rebels during a banon U.S. military aid.</TEXT></DOC>
