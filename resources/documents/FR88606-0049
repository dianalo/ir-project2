The assessment provides a basis for the conclusionthat the field testing of these genetically engineered tomato plants doesnot present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination and alsowill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statementneed not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address:</T2> Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at the Biotechnologyand Environmental Coordination Staff, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 406, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> Dr. Quentin B.

The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rules set forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation of interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates. APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).The Monsanto Agricultural Company of St. Louis, Missouri, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of geneticallyengineered tomato plants that are designed to be tolerant to tobacco mosaicvirus. In the course of reviewing the permit applications, APHIS assessedthe impact to the environment of releasing the tomato plants under theconditions described in the Monsanto application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will also not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by the Monsanto Agricultural Company, as wellas a review of other relevant literature, provides the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing. The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment. 1. A gene encoding the tobacco mosaic virus coat (capsid) protein has beeninserted into a tomato chromosome. In nature, the genetic material containedin a plant chromosome can only be transferred to another sexually compatibleplant via cross-pollination. In this field test trial, the inserted geneis unlikely to spread to any other plant by cross-pollination, becausethe field test plot is located at a sufficient distance from any sexuallycompatible plant with which the genetically engineered tomato plants couldcross-pollinate. 2. Tobacco mosaic virus is a plant pathogen; however, neither the tobaccomosaic virus coat (capsid) protein gene itself, nor the derived gene productconfers on tomato any plant pathogenic characteristic. 3. The plasmid vector used to transfer the tobacco mosaic virus coat (capsid)protein gene into a tomato chromosome has been evaluated for its use inthis experiment. The plasmid vector, although derived from an originalwild-type Ti plasmid with known plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed;that is, phytohormone genes which are necessary to confer plant pathogenictraits have been removed from the plasmid vector. The plasmid vector hasbeen tested and shown to be not pathogenic to any susceptible plant. 4. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium that was used to deliverthe plasmid vector encoding the tobacco mosaic virus coat (capsid) proteingene into a tomato plant cell, has been demonstrated by <T3>in vitro</T3> and <T3>in vivo</T3> assays to be eliminated and no longer associated withany transformed tomato plant or seed. 5. Horizontal movement by infectious transfer or transposition of any ofthe introduced genes or DNA sequences to another organism is not knownto be possible. The plasmid vector acts by delivering the gene to the tomatogenome where it is stably inserted into the tomato chromosomal DNA. Theplasmid vector cannot replicate independently of its vector agent and doesnot survive alone in any plant. No mechanism of horizontal movement isknown to exist in nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosome ofa transformed plant to any other organism. 6. The size of the field test plot is approximately 0.85 acre and willbe located on a private farm. Monsanto has taken precautions to providefor the identity and physical security of the field plot. The experimentalfield is located away from any major road or town. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 31st day of May, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
