The $19 million insider trading case that became public thisweek has expanded to Switzerland, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder toldCongress on Wednesday. Ruder said authorities have learned thatFred C. Lee, the Hong Kong trader accused in the case, traded someU.S. securities from the European country.   ``We're now seeking information from Swiss authorities, andtrying to get a freeze on assets he has there,'' Ruder toldreporters during a break in the hearing by the Senate BankingCommittee's securities subcommittee.   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, told the lawmakers thatthe Lee case is one of 40 or 50 investigations under way in whichforeign trading is involved. He said at least one of theinvestigations involves ``very large dollar amounts,'' and thatothers range down to as little as $40,000 to $50,000 or less.   Ruder declined to say what the value of Lee's Swiss trades orassets might be. But Lynch said the trades Lee made from theEuropean country were part of the $19 million Lee allegedly earnedby trading on inside information.   The SEC has accused Stephen Wang Jr., 24, a securities analystfor Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., of providing Lee with privilegedinformation on at least 25 corporate takeovers that Morgan Stanleyhandled. The agency says Lee made at least $19 million using theinformation and gave $200,000 to Wang.   Lee, 38, is based in Hong Kong, but also has a home in theWashington suburb of McLean, Va. Lynch said Lee, a native ofTaiwan, has claimed Canadian citizenship with at least onebrokerage firm he used.   The SEC is seeking $76 million from the two men, which wouldcover a repayment of the money they made, plus triple damages. Thatreward is surpassed by only the $100 million the SEC recovered wheninsider trader Ivan F. Boesky settled with the agency in November1986.   Wang's attorney, Ira L. Sorkin, has declined to comment on theaccusations other than to say he is studying them.   Lee's lawyer, Michael Perlis, said in a telephone interviewWednesday from his San Francisco office that Lee intended to resistthe SEC's accusations but likely would remain outside this country.   Asked about press reports quoting Perlis as indicating he mightattempt to settle the accusations for far less than the amount theSEC is requesting from his client, Perlis said, ``That's justspeculation.''   But he also said, ``Every case can be settled and should besettled on terms agreeable to all parties.''   SEC officials have said Lee did some of the allegedly illicittrading through a Hong Kong investment management company,Federated International Investment Management (FE) Ltd., asubsidiary of Aetna Life and Casualty.   In Hong Kong today, Federated's managing director, Nigel Lester,confirmed Lee was an ex-client and the company has been cooperatingwith SEC officials. He said no allegations of wrongdoing have beenraised against Federated employees, but declined to discuss detailsof the SEC investigation.   Ruder and Lynch, along with State Department legal adviser MaryV. Mochary, appeared before the subcommittee to testify in favor oflegislation that would give the SEC more powers to conductsecurities investigations in this country at the request of foreigncountries.   Currently, the SEC can only force the presentation of evidenceif there are indications that U.S. law has been broken. Sponsors,including Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of thesubcommittee, hope that if that power is expanded, other nationswill cooperate when U.S. authorities need records from overseas.   Similar legislation was introduced Wednesday in the House byReps. John Dingell, D-Mich., Edward Markey, D-Mass., Norman Lent,R-N.Y., and Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
