The report, by the House subcommittee on governmentinformation, sharply criticized the Federal CommunicationsCommission for not making phone-system reliability a toppriority. &quot;The problem of (phone) network reliability isgetting worse, not better,&quot; charged Rep. Bob Wise, (D., W.Va.), who chairs the subcommittee. &quot;This is a scarysituation.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Richard Firestone, chairman of the FCC's common carrierbureau, disputed many of Rep. Wise's assertions and said theFCC is aggressively overseeing phone-system quality. OnFriday, the day that Rep. Wise released the report, theagency named a Network Reliability Council, headed by PaulHenson, former chairman of United Telecommunications Inc. Thecouncil will advise the FCC on phone quality and encouragephone companies to cooperate on issues of reliability.   The House panel recommended that the FCC include areliability factor in the formula for regulating potentialphone company profits. Currently, the FCC puts a ceiling onphone company rates, giving the companies an incentive to cutcosts and maximize profits. The agency argues that phonecompanies won't reduce quality because they lose revenueduring outages. But the House panel was unconvinced and saidthe agency should change the price-cap formula to includequality as a factor. The agency said it would consider therecommendation.   One potential solution -- making phone companies liablefor the damage caused to customers during phone outages --wasn't addressed by either the House panel or the FCCrebuttal. FCC regulations currently protect phone companiesfrom paying such damages. Agency officials occasionallybluster that they will lift the protection, but they considerthe change so drastic that they refer to it as &quot;the atombomb&quot; option.   The reliability of the U.S. phone system came underquestion after a series major phone outages at AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the regional Bell companies.The House report said the phone network was becoming morevulnerable to failure because new technology tended toconcentrate phone traffic in a few key installations.   For instance, fiber-optic wires can carry 80,000 calls ata time -- far more than conventional copper cables. But whenoptical cables are accidentally cut, the damage is muchgreater than with conventional cables. Similarly, newtelephone switches are far more capable than older models,but there are fewer of them. Thus, when a new switch goesdown, the effects spread quickly through the system.   The FCC disputed the panel's findings about greatervulnerability. It said that by any number of measures --including percentage of calls that are completed and theability of the network to reroute calls when a cable is cut-- the network is performing better than ever.</TEXT></DOC>
