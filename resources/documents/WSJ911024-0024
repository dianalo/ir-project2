Union officials couldn't be reached, anddetails of the accord weren't immediately available.</LP><TEXT>   Union employees at the Douglas Aircraft Co. unit haveworked without a contract since the old one expired in March.Members of three other UAW locals are covered under a newMcDonnell contract that was ratified by them and rejectedtwice by Local 148 members last spring.   That proposal called for general wage increases of 3% ineach of the first two years and 4% in each of the next two.Workers would receive a 4% lump-sum payment in 1992. Local148 members said they were more unhappy about the company'sproposed new work rules and health benefits than with thewage increases. The biggest complaint was that the companyproposed reducing premium pay on weekends.   Douglas Aircraft, Long Beach, Calif., has about 18,700active employees who would be covered by a new contract, acompany spokesman said. The other UAW locals togetherrepresent about 4,000 active employees.   McDonnell Douglas is based in St. Louis.</TEXT></DOC>
