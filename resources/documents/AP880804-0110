Under terms of the congressional action, the railroad reinstated1,156 brakemen's jobs it says are unnecessary. The railroad saidthose positions would be secure until the end of a 36-daycooling-off period or in the event of a settlement to thelongstanding dispute.   The company and union said they expected quick presidentialapproval of the congressional measure and declared the strike overwithout waiting for the formality. President Reagan later signed itinto law at about 1:30 EDT, said Rep. Terry Bruce, who attended thebill-signing at the White House.   Bruce and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., both negotiated a compromisethat delayed the strike _ originally scheduled for shortly aftermidnight _ until after the morning rush-hour.   Delaying the walkout spared 41,000 commuters the incovenience ofhaving to find another way to work.   During the cooling-off period, the union may not strike and thecompany cannot eliminate jobs, said Bruce.   The dispute centers on a Candamp;NW plan to adopt new work rulescutting the size of most of its train crews from four to twoworkers, a move the union vigorously opposes.   United Transportation Union President Fred Hardin said he wasoptimistic a settlement to the dispute could be reached beforeSept. 9, when the cooling-off period ends.   ``I think it can be if both parties will negotiate in goodfaith,'' Hardin said.   In addition to its commuter services, the railroad moves freighton 6,400 miles of track in 10 Midwestern states. The strike by2,600 UTU members would have snarled freight traffic in thosestates and likely would have idled 7,500 unionized Candamp;NW workers.   All of the UTU workers for Candamp;NW walked out, except for theoperators of commuter and freight trains that were in transit whenthe strike was declared, Bloedorn said.   Just two hours later, members of the House of Representativesunanimously approved a measure delaying the strike until Sept. 9,said David Carle, a spokesman for Simon.   The House acted quickly to avoid disruption of service toChicago-area commuters, said Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairmanof the House Energy and Commerce Committee's transportationsubcommitte.   ``Moreover, the loss of rail service in parts of the Midwestwill cause significant hardships for farmers trying to get theirgrain to market in these very difficult times,'' he said.   Union workers briefly picketed Candamp;NW's downtown Chicago terminal,but some with reluctance.   ``It's taken up way too much time for for both parties,'' saidMichael Boykin, 35, a freight foreman and 14-year veteran of thecompany. ``If they'd really wanted to, both parties could havereached an amicable agreement.''</TEXT></DOC>
