A Census Bureau publication, the first printed compilation of data on black Americans from the 1980 census, gives the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., a claim to that distinction.    Prince Georges County and Montgomery County, the two Maryland counties on the rim of the nation's capital, had average black family income in 1979 of nearly $23,000. They also had a 77% high-school graduation rate for blacks 25 years and older. These are the highest figures for any of the 93 U.S. counties with black populations of at least 50,000.    The Maryland counties shine in other social and economic rankings of black Americans. Poverty was among the lowest, and the percentage of people working the highest of any county with substantial black population.    These sound like characteristics of young, upwardly striving suburbanites, rather than people who haven't budged for generations, and the census figures bear this out. Between 1970 and 1980, the District of Columbia lost 17% of its black population. Most of these folks simply moved across the D.C.-Maryland line.    Prince Georges County's black population mushroomed 170% in this decade. The comparable figure for Montgomery County was 136%. By comparison, the black population for the U.S. as a whole grew 17% over these 10 years.    Black suburbanization was repeated elsewhere during the 1970s and, although hard statistics won't be available until 1990, demographers assume the phenomenon is continuing at an accelerated rate in the current decade. Market research firms have long since zeroed in on these geographic clusters of relative black affluence, prime territory for pitching products that appeal to middle-class blacks.    Larry Long, chief of the Census Bureau's demographic analysis staff, cautions that the black suburban flow will likely ease in the future because, &quot;just as in the case with whites, almost all who want to move to the suburbs, or all who can afford to, will have done so.&quot; But for now, Mr. Long adds, &quot;my seat of the pants guess is that one would expect continuing suburbanization of blacks.&quot;    THE MINORITY RUSH to the suburbs was biggest in five counties, where black populations increased by well over 100% during the 1970s. All the counties were next door to cities with large black populations. In addition to the two Maryland counties mentioned above, they were Baltimore County, Md., where black population exploded by 170%; St. Louis County, Mo., with an increase of 141%, and De Kalb County, Ga., part of metropolitan Atlanta, where the number of blacks soared 130%.    As in the case of the D.C. suburban counties, the income, education and employment characteristics of the other three counties were well above the norm for black counties nationwide.    The census survey makes a number of other noteworthy points about the status of U.S. blacks in the decade ending in 1980:    The movement of blacks out of the Old South, a demographic fact of life for 100 years, came to a halt in the 1970s. The big factor in the turnaround seems to have been industry's move to the Sun Belt at the same time that traditional jobs in the industrial Midwest were drying up.    Memphis, Tenn., replaced Cleveland as the 10th most populous black city.    Two blue-collar cities, Flint, Mich., and Gary, Ind., led all communities in average black-family income. The figure for Flint was about $18,600, partially a reflection of well-paying auto industry jobs in the vicinity. In the third spot was Washington, D.C., where blacks have been able to capitalize on equal employment opportunity trends in government jobs.    In nine states, more than 40% of black households were headed by a woman with no husband present. Almost half of all black homes in Wisconsin were run solely by a woman, and in Nebraska, another state without a large urban poulation, the figure was a surprising 43%.    Vermont, with just 0.2% of the national black population, had the highest average black-family income, at $20,750 annually. Mississippi and Arkansas were on the bottom at around $9,000.    ---   YIN AND YANG MEET THE SUN BELT. The regions of the U.S. are out of economic whack, says a team of Japanese economists, offering a decidedly Oriental solution to the U.S. trade deficit.    The U.S. economy is in a &quot;vicious cycle,&quot; according to the Japanese, with the growth of the South and West outstripping the supplier capacity of the industrial North. This leads to increased reliance on imports and a widening trade deficit. What's needed is a &quot;virtuous cycle,&quot; a synchronized meshing of technology, management and business environment similar to the post-war situation that put the U.S. on top of the world economic heap.    Solution: Shift industrial sites from the Northern states to the West and South, creating three decentralized economic regions that balance each other in raw materials, components and assembly products.    &quot;Foreign firms can play a role&quot; in this massive economic reshuffle, hints the report, produced by the Tokyo-based International Trade Institute, the research arm of the association of Japan's trading companies. </TEXT></DOC>
