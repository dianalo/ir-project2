(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman has pleaded guilty to helping herboyfriend rape her teen-age daughter so the girl could bear thechild the mother could not.   In a rare case of a woman charged with rape, the 38-year-oldmother pleaded guilty last week to attempted rape, admitting herrole in the 1986 attack on her 14-year-old daughter.   The mother wanted another baby but was unable to bear children,so she attempted to have her 31-year-old boyfriend get her daughterpregnant, the daughter told police.   The boyfriend threatened to beat the girl's mother if theteen-ager refused to have sex with him, the girl said in anaffidavit. The boyfriend slapped the mother in front of the girl,and the mother watched the sexual attack, the girl said.   The rape was not reported until a year later, after the girlgave birth to a boy and social services authorities intervened.   Social workers had sued the boyfriend for child support, and thegirl's mother sought custody of the baby, Assistant DistrictAttorney Kathleen Dougherty said.   But lab tests showed that the boyfriend was not the baby'sfather, Dougherty said. The father was the girl's own boyfriend,she said.   The woman, who was indicted in April on a charge of rape,pleaded guilty Sept. 1 to the reduced charge. Judge Patrick J.Cunningham said he would sentence her to probation Oct. 19,according to her lawyer, Steven Paquette.   The woman's boyfriend pleaded guilty to rape Aug. 15. Cunninghamsaid he will sentence him to no more than a year in jail on Sept.26.   The identities of those involved in the case have not beenreleased.</TEXT></DOC>
