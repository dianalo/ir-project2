 There are pratical reasons.andP;  We have todecide what clothes to wear, whether or not to go golfing on Saturday, etc.andM;But our obsession runs beyond the mere physical.andP;  Weather affects usemotionally, too.andP;  Our ability to &quot;irrationalize&quot; has left us helpless to theelements, it seems, as the weather tugs and twists our moods and attitudes.andM;Rainy days give most people the blues.andP;  &quot;Nice&quot; days (sunny, warm, but nothot) make people nicer.andP;  Extreme days -- very hot, very cold -- brings outthe extreme in people's personalities.andM;Like most, I am obsessed with weather.andP;  I've just gotta know.andP;  That's why Ipounced on the chance to testdrive TMI's (Lake Oswego, OR) PC-based weatherstation -- the PC Weather Pro.andM;It's a great product.andP;  And I want desperately to write a raving review.andP;  But,taking into consideration the reality of a normal cold and cruel businessagenda, and agenda with no room for something as abstract as obsession, I'mnot without reservations on the product's overall &quot;business&quot; usefulness.andO;More on that later.andP;  For now, let's talk about what it can do, keeping inmind that I had more fun installing and playing with the Weather Pro than anyother product I've ever testdriven.andM;The PC Weather Pro turns your IBM-compatible PC into your very own weatherstation.andP;  It monitors and stores measurement of six weather variables:barometric pressure, rainfall, inside and outside temperature, wind speed andwind chill temperature.andP;  It displays and analyzes everything in extraordinaryclear screens on the PCs CRT.andM;It's hardware/software system consisting of a circuit card, an anenometer(with 40' cable), a wind vane (with 40' cable), rain sensor (with 40' cable),two temperatures probes (indoor and outdoor), power adapter, mounting kit,installation and operation manuals and software.andM;Installation was not only fairly easy, but a lot of fun.andM;I started with the anenometer and wind vane assembly.andP;  Pure cake.andP;  Everythingsnapped together and tightened with an allen wrench which TMI provided.andO;Figuring out a place to mount it was the tricky part, complicated by the factthat we're located on the fourth floor of a 12-story building in the Flatironsection of Manhattan.andP;  Lots of big buildings makes for less than accuratewind readings.andM;(Note: An anemometer measures wind speed.andP;  It looks like a little moleculemodel with tilted cups at the end of its spokes.andP;  But you already knew that.)andM;Ideally, of course, the AN/WV assembly should be placed above roof lines andaway from trees and other interference (which large buildings certainlyqualify as).andP;  But I've long since learned that we live in anything but anideal world.andP;  .  ., so I bolted the thing to a broken piece of two by four wehad lying around and wedged it into one of the kitchen's windows, running thecable back to the ATandamp;T 6300 I had targeted as my testdrive victim.andM;Now, all that might not sound like a laugh-riot, but it was.andP;  Despite theless-than-professional install, I got a certain &quot;Mr.andP;  Science&quot; thrill out ofit.andM;The temperature probes are merely 11' long wires with a sensor at the end.andO;You run one outside and the other inside, i.e.andP;  throw one outside a windowand leave the other one inside.andM;The rain sensor is really cool.andP;  It's a self-emptying gauge that logsrainfall whenever one tenth of an inch of water is measured in its collectingfunnel.andP;  It looks a like a tiny nuclear reactor.andM;I set up somewhat half-assed as well, ramming another piece of wood under acorroded part of a ledge outside Andy's window.andP;  It was kind of a divingboard-deal, with the rain gauge screwed down at the end of the plank.andP;  Itwasn't pretty, but fairly effective.andP;  It was close to level and far enoughaway from the building so as not to be blocked from New york's rancid sky.andO;Again, its 40' long wire ran back to the PC.andM;OK.andP;  With all that ready, it was just a matter of popping the half-slot boardinto the computer's backplane, copying the software into the machine andconnecting all the wires.andP;  The board has six jacks on the back of it.andP;  Eachis clearly labeled.andP;  There's one for the power adaptor, outside temperature,inside temperature, rain, wind speed, and wind direction, respectively.andP;  Yousimply pop in the wires and you're off.andM;Designing the board with its own AC power adaptor was a great idea.andP;  Theweather circuitry on the board is therefore completely powered via theadaptor, so the system continues to monitor weather conditions even when thecomputer is turned off.andM;You also don't have to be in a certain directory when you want to play withWeather Pro.andP;  A hot-key and/or keys of your choice pops it up anytime,anywhere.andM;There is some basic futzing around to take care of initially, most notablysetting the time and date, and deciding on the conversion types you want tomeasure in -- Fahrenheit vs.andP;  Celsius, MPH vs.andP;  KPH vs.andP;  knots, etc.andP;  It tookabout four minutes to get this straightened out.andP;  American all the way.andM;Install over.andP;  I had all the current weather information at my greedy littlefingertips -- all spelled out in clear, high-tech-lookin' displays.andM;There are too many display screen to go into them all in detail.andP;  We have,however, some actual reproductions of the screens.andP;  See them to get an ideaof how nice these displays actually look.andM;Some things to point out: You can set up weather alarms.andP;  For example, ifyour heart desires, you can program the system to ge beep when thetemperature hits freezing outside or boils over 100 degrees.andP;  The alarms workwith every thing the system measures -- temperature, rainfall, barometricpressure, wind gusts, etc.andM;The system can also log weather data into a database for subsequent analysis.andO;You can plot the daily information for any of the six variables monitored bythe system.andP;  The system automatically creates and stores separate filescontaining the information on each day's weather.andP;  Measurements are recordedevery 30 minutes even when the computer is being used with another program.andO;You can call these records up at anytime.andM;Further, an additional PC Weather Toolkit software program lets you massageand twist this data into literally hundreds of different reports, includingreport that give big picture of what the weather has been doing over the pastthree or four days.andP;  It also lets you link the data with programs like Lotus1-2-3 and Borland's Reflex.andM;These reports will actually let you predict, with some basic meteorologicalsmarts, what the weather is going to be like in the near future.andM;Which brings me back to the reservations I mentioned at the beginning of thisarticle.andM;You see, I know that TMI wants to market this product both commercially andas a hobby for weather enthusiasts.andP;  I have absolutely no problems with thelatter.andM;TMI sent me the product because they thought that interconnects might beinterested in it.andP;  The rationale: they have people in the field; and knowingthe weather would help them plan their installations and service calls moreefficiently.andM;That could be true, I guess.andP;  But most interconnect-work is done inside.andO;And, I have a real hard time imagining an interconnect president telling hisservice team to &quot;Get over to that Holiday Inn on route 23.andP;  Their system justcrashed.andP;  And don't forget your rubbers and rain coats, there's a stormingrolling in!&quot;andM;Second, and more to the point, even if it is imperative for them to know whatthe weather is going to be like -- do they have the time, desire andknowledge to get wrapped up in Weather Pro to the extent that they'llactually predict the weather?andP;  Probably not.andP;  As I thought about the system'sinterconnect-market potential, I couldn't help but hear a perverted Dylanlyric in my ear: I don't need a PC-based weather system to know which way thewind blows.andM;Wouldn't it be faster, easier and cheaper to turn on the old bood-tube orlisten to the radio?andP;  I don't know.andP;  Just a thought.andM;There's no way I could totally dismiss this product.andP;  It's just too much fun.andO;Easy to install and, considering how much information it gives you, modestlypriced at $575.andP;  A price tag which includes everything in the system.andM;Overall, I think TMI should concentrate on the huge legion of hobby-happyhomunculi out there who would love nothing better than to throw this thinginto their PCs.andP;  In the obsession-addled world of the hobbyist, weather makesa lot of sense.andP;  I'm definitely hooked.andM;NEC 9100andM;Cellular PhoneandM;The &quot;pay phone revolution&quot; may be here.andP;  But it's certainly not doing me anygood.andP;  I can never find one when I want.andP;  And after 20 minutes in line forone at Communications Networks, I figured that was it.andP;  I splurged on ahandheld cellular phone.andM;The phone and its assorted gadgetry set us back $1,500.andP;  I say &quot;us&quot; becauseall of us will find it immensely useful for solving crises back at the officewhile we're traveling.andM;After using it for a week, my conclusion is simple: This is one fantasticgadget.andP;  Anyone who travels needs a cellular phone.andP;  There's no beating acellular's ability to find you almost anywhere.andP;  And to call from almostanywhere (well, anywhere you're likely to be on business).andM;There are three types of cellular phones -- car phones, transportables andhandheld portable ones.andP;  The car phones and some of the transportablestransmit at the maximum allowable -- 3 watts.andP;  The portable, handheld ones,like the one I've got, work at 0.6 of a watt -- or about one-fifth the power.andM;This naturally makes the car phones and the transportables work better thanthe handheld ones.andP;  And everyone in L.A.andP;  has car phones because they havecars.andP;  And everyone in New York has handhelds, because, even if they hadcars, they wouldn't trust their fellow New Yorkers not to steal the carphone.andM;I thought that not having the extra power would be a major drawback.andP;  But, sofar, I'm wrong (at least for outgoing calls).andP;  This handheld phone is simplyamazing.andP;  It works virtually everywhere I want to work.andP;  And I can avoidthose few, (obvious) places it doesn't by simly walking a hundred yards orso.andM;All handheld cellulars have a signal strength meter.andP;  It tells you thestrength of the signal.andP;  Maximum is five, minimum is nothing.andP;  The machinetells you when you have nothing - &quot;No Service.&quot;andM;Here's some of the places my handheld has worked well for me:andM;1.andP;  On Amtrak's Metroliner between New York and Washington -- except intunnels.andP;  Reception was good.andM;2.andP;  Walking on New York streets.andP;  Lots of static.andP;  But the persons I calledheard me fine.andM;3.andP;  In a taxi on New York streets.andP;  OK uptown.andM;4.andP;  In a taxi in Washington, DC, coming in from the train station to myhotel.andP;  Fantastic reception.andP;  My daughter thought I was calling from theoffice, three blocks away.andP;  I was calling from 200 miles away.andM;5.andP;  Inside the Ziegfield theater in New Yrok City waiting for Lawrence ofArabia.andP;  Good quality.andP;  It even worked in the bathroom.andM;6.andP;  In a plane waiting on the ground at the gates, with the door closed.andP;  Not bad.andM;6.andP;  20 miles from Albany, New York, in the middle of nowhere.andP;  Amazinglygood.andM;(ow to some houskeeping: When you buy a cellular phone, you get asked whichcompany you want service from.andP;  You don't have many choices.andP;  The FCC neatlyorganized this decision.andP;  It gave out two cellular licenses in each city.andO;Only two.andP;  One to the wireline carrier (i.e.andP;  the local phone company) andone to an &quot;independent.&quot; As far as I can see, they both charge the sameprices, or very close (ain't that cute?) and they both offer roughly the sameroaming service -- the term they give o their ability to interconnect youwith cellulars in other cities.andM;I choose Metro One over Nynex because my lawyer bought a cellular and calledNynex on three separate occasions to get a service area map, was promised oneand never got one.andP;  He recommended Metro One.andM;My experience with Metro One was a little better.andP;  When you subscribe, thefellow who sells you the phone is meant to organize service and to programyour phone, and give you information on your carrier.andM;I got no information, no welcome kit, no pricing information, nothing, just alame excuse.andP;  One night I called Metro One (800-242-7327) and was put on holdfor eight hours.andP;  I actually fell asleep with Metro One's message telling me&quot;an agent would be with me shortly.&quot;andM;I later found out some idiot had forgotten to turn the Night Answer recordingon on their ACD and that Metro One's hours of Customer Service were narrow,just during the day.andM;When you do get onto them (only during the day), they're helpful.andP;  They sentme the roaming brochure.andP;  And eventually, I called the president's office andgot a press kit, which told me their prices.andP;  I still haven't received aWelcome Kit.andM;In short, which carrier you choose may more a matter of astrology thanscience.andP;  I suspect personal service got sacrificed in this business on thealtar of exploding demand.andM;As to why I bought the NEC Cellular 9100, there were four reasons.andP;  First,someone had loaned me one in Dulles Airport.andP;  It sounded fabulous.andP;  Second,I'd had excellent recommendations.andP;  The man in Dulles Airport worked forCellular One (the Cincinnati Bell sub.andP;  that does all intra-cellular systembilling) and said it was the best portable cellular.andP;  My lawyer had one.andP;  Herecommended it, Third, I just didn't like the feel and look of the onlyremaining alternatives -- the Motorola 8000 series.andP;  They are heavier andhave non-retractable antennas.andM;However, the Motorola 8000 G, which costs a hundred or so more than the NEC,has a much more powerful battery -- two and half hours of continuous talktime, versus only 45 minutes for the NEC.andP;  And that may be important to you.andM;In total, with all the various and sundry NEC stuff, the cost was nearly$1,500.andP;  I honestly can't tell you if the NEC 9100 I bought is better orworse than the ones they're advertising for $695 &quot;direct from themanufacturers.&quot;andM;It's possible if some of those manufacturers lend us a phone for a week ortwo we'll do a testdrive.andP;  But it's expensive to do a testdrive when you haveto buy the stuff.andP;  Normally, manufacturers lend us the stuff for a month orso and we return it.andP;  But none of the cellular phone guys shows muchpropensity to let us testdrive their phones.andP;  They have enough difficultykeeping up with demand.andM;There are some things I don't like about the NEC phone.andP;  I'd like to see thething made more &quot;user friendly.&quot;andP;  This means several things: I'd like to beable to adjust the incoming ringing sound.andP;  It's very quiet.andP;  I missed animportant call in a restaurant because there was too much ambient noise.andP;  I'dlike to see the thing flash a little red light when a call comes in, also.andM;At this point I should warn you: Just because you're getting a signal andthus are, theoretically, able to make a call, doesn't necessarily mean you'reable to receive a call.andM;The phone has a meter -- one through five.andP;  Five is the strongest signal.andP;  Isat at my desk one afternoon and tried to dial myself.andP;  On ly after I hadmoved the phone around my office until it got &quot;four&quot; was I actually able toreceive a phone call.andP;  The rest of the times I called it just rung and rung.andO;I think that's silly.andP;  The machine should tell you both if it can receiveand/or make a call.andM;There are some other things I'd like to see.andP;  I'd like to see the batterycharger change from red (it's charging) to green (it's fully charged).andP;  MyToshiba laptop does that.andP;  My NEC cellular should also.andP;  Unfortunately, itstays red all the time.andP;  Overcharging nicads can kill them.andP;  So it would benice to know.andM;I'd like the whole thing to be more &quot;modular.&quot;andP;  With extra gadgetry youshould be able to make this 0.6 watt cellular phone into a 3 watttransportable phone.andP;  With a little more gadgetry you ought to be able toplug the thing into your car.andM;You can't get a transportable conversion kit from NEC.andP;  You can get a carmounting kit.andP;  But the extra gadgetry is so expensive and so cumbersone,you'd be better off buying a car-phone-only cellular phone.andM;You should be able to plug this phone into a cable coming out of yourdashboard and thus make your 0.6 watt handheld into a 3 watt cellular carphone.andP;  Then you should be able to unplug it and take it with you.andM;Unfortunately, my simplistic design idea doesn't exist, as yet.andP;  You can seeby the diagram (taken from NEC's attractive manual) that you seem to need allsorts of things -- like a klunky car adapter, a separate handset, a separatemicrophone, an auxiliary speaker, etc.andM;Now to the $64 question.andP;  Should you wait or buy now?andP;  If you wit, quality,coverage and user friendliness will improve and prices will drop.andP;  (Pricesare already down over 50% in two years.)andM;It's all a question of what your time is worth.andP;  I figure on using it for acouple of years -- getting my money's worth -- and moving onto something alot better then.andM;Frankly, I can't see them getting much smaller or lighter.andP;  You still have toaccommodate an earpiece, a mouthpiece, a dial pad and a heavy battery.andM;They are one fantastic business tool.andP;  Frankly, if you travel, sell for aliving (and who doens't?) you probably need one -- NOW!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
