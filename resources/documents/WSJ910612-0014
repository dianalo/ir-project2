The Philadelphia-based phone company is talking about asmall earphone that could soon replace conventional headsetsfor telephone operators, telemarketers and others who requirehands-free time on the phone.   The Audissey resembles an earpiece from a portablestereo's headphone, but is smaller, rests in rather than overthe ear, and contains both speaker and microphone. BellAtlantic, which demonstrated the device at the ConsumerElectronics Show last week, says its operators will begintesting it later this month. The trial will help determinewhether the earphone stays in the ear securely and iscomfortable for extended use.   If the tests go well, the Audissey will be ready for massproduction and marketing later this year. Michael Kendall,Bell Atlantic's product manager for the earphones, says theprice will be comparable to that of traditional headsets.   Developed by Norris Communications of Poway, Calif., theearphone uses the principle of bone conduction. Themicrophone picks up vibrations of bone and soft tissues setin motion as air passes over the vocal chords. A thin cordconnects the earphone to a control unit that plugs into anystandard telephone.   The Audissey eliminates most background noise, says Mr.Kendall. That suits it well for use with cellular phones andin crowded offices. Mr. Kendall conceived the project and hasworked on it for two years as part of Bell Atlantic'sChampions program to foster entrepreneurial spirit.   Elwood Norris, founder of Norris Communications andinventor of the Audissey, says he's working on a cordlessmodel that will transmit to receivers within 10 feet.   Despite the convenience, there is a drawback to tinyearphones. &quot;I use one around here, and people think I'mtalking to myself,&quot; Mr. Norris says.                                                                                                          Phone Network to Offer   Voice-Dialing Service                                                                                                          THE SOUND of your voice can dial your phone.   Sometime next year, Nynex plans to roll out a service thatallows customers to preprogram their telephones to respond tovoice commands. Feeling guilty? Pick up your phone and say&quot;Mom,&quot; and wait till she answers. An emergency? Say&quot;Ambulance]&quot; or &quot;Police]&quot; and within seconds, the phonenetwork automatically dials your call. Nynex's trial lastyear showed the service was particularly popular among oldercustomers and those with impaired vision.   The system also serves as an electronic phone directory.If a customer forgets his home phone number, the system canrecite it. It can store 30 to 50 numbers and requires nofancy equipment; the brains are in the phone network.   The service will compete with voice-recognition devicesthat attach to telephones. Unlike those devices, anetwork-based system operates during a power outage anddoesn't require separate units for each phone in the house.But it entails a monthly charge rather than a one-time cost.                                                                                                          Holding Meetings Night   And Day, Near and Far                                                                                                          VIDEO electronic mail may change the way many companiesview long-distance meetings.   VideoTelecom has added a Time-Conferencing feature to itspersonal-computer-based conferencing system, which includesvideo, audio, data and document displays. The new featureallows users to record a multimedia message, then store it inthe system or on a floppy disk to be viewed later at aseparate location. Employees on different continents can callup the message, change it and return it at a convenient hourrather than joining a live videoconference in the middle ofthe night.   The system's screen presentation features a separatewindow for displaying and changing documents or data, thevideo equivalent of passing a document around a conferencetable.   Dick Moeller, president and chief executive ofVideoTelecom, based in Austin, Texas, says e-mail was alogical next step since the company &quot;treats videoconferencinglike data communications,&quot; converting the various elements --video, audio and data -- to digital code. The company's newsystem, called MediaMax, offers six times more processingpower than the company's previous multimedia product, Mr.Moeller says.   The system isn't for those with skimpy resources, but itscost is in line with that of other videoconferencing systems,which range from $50,000 to $100,000 a site. VideoTelecomsays it will begin shipping the product this month.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          TWO communications companies are working on software tosignal cellular networks to reduce power so cellular phonescan work on the lower wattage of pocket phones. McCawCellular Communications and Tele-Communications are teamingup in Medford, Ore., to gauge the potential market for pocketphones and to see if McCaw's network can connect through new,smaller transmission sites to TCI's coaxial-cable andoptical-fiber network. The low-power service can't be used ina moving car, but costs less than full-powered cellularservice. . . . Matt Edwards, a pioneer in personalcommunications, explores a new play on an old technology:facsimile broadcasting. Customers would use an adapter toreceive faxes sent over the airwaves and select informationthey want, which could include continually updatednewspapers, stock tables and sports scores.</TEXT></DOC>
