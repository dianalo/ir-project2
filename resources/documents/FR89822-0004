A revision of these procedures is necessary in order to bring theminto conformance with the Department's rules at 45 CFR part 16 (46 FR 43817,August 31, 1981) which established the requirements and procedures applicableto the Departmental Appeals Board with respect to disputes arising undercertain departmental grant and cooperative agreement programs. The majorchanges consist of the addition of one adverse determination to which theprocedure is applicable and the deletion of another in order to eliminatethe possibility of confusion arising as a result of the different areasof jurisdiction which are currently reflected by the two sets of regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Theodore J. Roumel, Phone:301/443-1874.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>HHS published a Notice of ProposedRulemaking (NPRM) with respect to the revision of the informal PHS appealprocedures on July 8, 1988 (53 FR 25631). Comments from the public wererequested. A single commenter provided several comments, but only one wasconsidered to be relevant to the proposed changes in the regulatory text.That comment pertained to proposed andSection; 50.404(a)(4) which describesthe appealable adverse determination being added to the PHS regulationsby this revision. That paragraph appeared in the NPRM as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">A denial of a noncompeting continuation award under the project periodsystem of funding where the denial is for failure to comply with the termsof a previous award. This does not apply to denials that are due to thegrantee's poor performance or to the unavailability of funds.</ITAG>The commenter suggested that the last sentence of the above paragraph renderedthe paragraph more restrictive than the corresponding provision in theDepartmental appeal regulations (45 CFR part 16, appendix A, paragraph(C)(a)(3)) the language of which is identical to the first sentence ofthe proposed paragraph quoted above. It was not the intent of PHS to add language which would be interpretedas more restrictive than that in the Departmental regulations. The intentwas to add language which would provide clarification as to the scope ofthe subject provision. Since the added language appears to have causedconfusion, it has been deleted. The PHS language with respect to this adversedetermination now exactly reflects that in the HHS regulations. In allother respects, except for minor editorial changes, the final rule followsthe language of the proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Impact Analysis </ITAG><T3>Executive Order 12291: </T3>Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatoryimpact analysis be prepared for major rules_defined in the Order as anyrule that has an annual effect on the nationally economy of $100 millionor more, or certain other specified effects. The Secretary certifies thatthese regulations are not major rules within the meaning of the ExecutiveOrder because they do not have an effect on the economy of $100 millionor more or otherwise meet the threshold criteria. <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980: </T3>The Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6) requires the Federal Government to anticipate andreduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirements on small businesses.The Secretary has determined that this regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities and hereby certifiesthat an initial regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 50 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs_health, Health care.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 42 CFR part 50, subpart D, isrevised as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James F.

These regulations provide such an informal preliminary procedurefor resolution of disputes within PHS in order to preclude submission ofcases to the Departmental Appeals Board before PHS has had an opportunityto review decisions of its officials and to settle disputes with grantees.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;50.404 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">What disputes are covered by these procedures? </ITAG>(a) These procedures are applicable to the following adverse determinationsunder PHS discretionary project grants and cooperative agreements (hereinafterboth referred to as grants): (1) Termination, in whole or in part, of a grant for failure of the granteeto carry out its approved project in accordance with the applicable lawand the terms and conditions of such assistance or for failure of the granteeotherwise to comply with any law, regulation, assurance, term, or conditionapplicable to the grant.
