NPF-72 andNPF-77 issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (the licensee), for operationof Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Will County, Illinois.<ITAG tagnum="84">Identification of Proposed Action</ITAG>The amendment would consist of changes to the Technical Specifications(TS) and would authorize an increase of the storage capacity of the spentfuel pool from 1060 fuel assemblies to 2870 fuel assemblies.The amendment to the TS is responsive to the licensee's application datedJanuary 3, 1989 as supplemented January 24, and February 10, 1989. TheNRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment of the Proposed Action,``Environmental Assessment by the Office of Nuclear Reactor RegulationRelating to the Expansion of the Spent Fuel Pool, Facility Operating LicenseNos. NPF-72 and NPF-77, Commonwealth Edison Company, Braidwood Station,Units 1 and 2, Docket Nos. 50-456 and 50-457, dated July 13, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Environmental Assessment</ITAG>The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handlingand Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel'' (NUREG-0575), Volumes1-3, (1979), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storageof spent fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflectsthe advantage of continued generation of nuclear power with the accompanyingspent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommendedevaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis.For Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, the expansion of the storage capacityof the spent fuel pool will not create any significant additional radiologicaleffects or non-radiological environmental impacts beyond those assessedin the Commission's Final Environmental Statement related to operationof Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, NUREG-1026, June 1984.The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expendedspent fuel pool is estimated to be less than one percent of the total annualoccupational radiation exposure for this facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facilityrelative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part 51. Based on thisassessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiologicalor non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action and thatthe issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significantimpact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to10 CFR 51.31, no environmental impact statement needs to be prepared forthis action.For further details with respect to this action, see (10 the applicationfor amendment to the Technical Specifications dated January 3, 1989 assupplemented January 24, and February 10, 1989; (2) the FGEIS on Handlingand Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575), (3) theFinal Envorinmental Statement for Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, datedJune 1984, and (4) the Environmental Assessment dated July 13, 1989.
