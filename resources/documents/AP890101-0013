Armed Palestinians have approached the barbed wire fence alongthe border twice, on Dec. 26 and Dec. 28, and six of them werekilled by Israeli soldiers. Several rockets were fired into theregion from Lebanon on Friday.   Army officials say they believe radical factions of the PalestineLiberation Organization may step up their attempts to infiltrate andattack Israeli civilians to sabotage the PLO's movement towardnegotiation after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat recognized Israel.   Maj. Gadi, commander of a battalion stationed in this northernvillage, sees another new danger in a peace treaty signed in Beirutlass than two weeks ago by the PLO and Amal, the Lebanese ShiiteMoslem militia.   ``The Amal are acting as guides and bringing the terrorists up tothe border,'' says Gadi, whose last name cannot be used under armyregulations.   To 25-year-old Capt. Yossi and other soldiers, all infiltratorsare terrorists whose purpose is to attack civilian settlements, manyof them collective farms that grow apples.   There have been more than 20 major attempts to sneak into Israelfrom Lebanon this year, some of them by sea. Battles betweeninfiltrators and Israeli troops have claimed the lives of fivesoldiers and more than 25 guerrillas.   In the more than two months Gadi's soldiers have been stationedin Avivim, they have fought two battles with Lebanese guerrillas.Three guerrillas were killed, Gadi said, but ``we are lucky thereare no casualties on our side.''   The three infiltrators carried Soviet-designed Kalashnikovrifles, grenades and rocket-propelled launchers.   In the border sector next to Gadi's, Israeli soldiers escapedinjury in two recent battles with Palestinian guerrillas. Armyofficials say the guerrillas' target was Kibbutz Manara, acollective farm visible from a hilltop lookout post near Avivim.   Gadi, who at 29 has served 11 years in the army, says 23 civiliansettlements lie in the 12-mile border strip under his command.   Israel's elaborate border defenses against guerrilla attacksincludes a security zone on the Lebanese side patrolled by Israelisoldiers and an Israeli-backed Christian militia in Lebanon.   Near Avivim, the zone stretches from 1{ miles to seven milesnorth of the border. Mines are buried just inside Lebanon, andrusting rolls of concertina barbed wire are strung along both sidesof the border.   Touching the electronic border fence sets off alarms that armyofficers say can indicate to within about 100 yards where thetrouble is.   On the Israeli side, a road is patrolled by Israeli trucks and adusty strip is swept frequently so that any footprints can bedetected.   Still, says Yossi, both Palestinian and Lebanese Shiiteguerrillas keep trying to penetrate the barrier. ``It takes onlyfive minutes to cut the fence,'' he says.   Yossi says the infiltrators' trick is to try to sneak up as closeas possible during the day, then cut through the fence at night.   ``There are teen-agers sent into the border who don't stand achance,'' he noted.   The army says Palestinian guerrillas have carried leaflets sayingthey want to take civilian hostages to trade for colleagues jailedin Israel. Claims of responsibility often call for liberating Arabland lost with the creation of Israel in 1948.   About 300 yards from the border, an Israeli collective farmcalled Kibbutz Malkiyya is protected by a soldier at the gate, anearby army lookout post and rolls of concertina wire.   Across the fence, Lebanese farmers can be seen tending fieldsneatly divided by stones and herding sheep. Arab villages sit onhilltops in the distance.   ``It's green and nice until the shooting starts,'' says Gadi.</TEXT></DOC>
