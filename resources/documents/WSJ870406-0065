The monthly survey of purchasing managers at 250 industrial companies, conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Management, also reported an increase in employment, which is the first such increase since August 1984 and which follows 29 consecutive months of decline.    Prices continued to climb in March, marking the seventh consecutive month that purchasers reported paying higher prices, according to the survey. More than five times as many reported price increases as reported lower prices, compared with nine times as many in February. The average reported increase in prices was about 2.5%. &quot;While prices continue to increase, most purchasers do not see them as being significant,&quot; the report said.    According to the association, if the economy continues to grow at the rate indicated in this year's first quarter, it would translate into a 3% rise in the nation's gross national product for the year, up from an increase of about 2.1% in 1986.    The association's Composite Index increased to 53.9% in March from 51.9% in February, and the average for the quarter was 53.9%. A reading above 50% generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase, the association said. The Composite Index combines five components of the survey -- new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. The numbers reflect the Commerce Department's updated seasonal adjustment factors used to calculate the index and to adjust current and prior-year figures. The survey examines how various business activities change month to month, asking if they are better, the same, or worse.    Based on the survey, &quot;the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial, improvement,&quot; said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee. &quot;The sharp rise in growth of new orders assures a good beginning for the second quarter.&quot; Mr. Bretz is director of purchasing for Pitney Bowes Inc., the Stamford, Conn.-based maker of business equipment and systems.    The pace of new orders advanced in March. The 41% of purchasing managers reporting an improvement in new orders was the highest percentage since April 1984. Also, the difference between those reporting an increase in orders and those reporting a decline widened to 32%, the largest since April 1984, too. Mr. Bretz said the new-orders index is an especially good sign since it reflects orders for the future and means that the &quot;economy is on a good track&quot; for the next few months.    Mr. Bretz said the survey's findings about inventories also could be interpreted as a sign of continued growth. According to the survey, a greater percentage of purchasers reported lower inventories than those who reported larger inventories. For 29 consecutive months prior to February, more purchasers reported lower inventories than reported higher inventories. In February, an equal number reported higher and lower inventories.    &quot;Lower inventories could mean that shipments exceeded production, and since production is up, that would be an indication the economy is strong,&quot; Mr. Bretz said.    Vendor deliveries slowed in March, another sign that the economy improved. The 13% of managers reporting slower deliveries was the highest since September 1984. The difference between the 13% reporting slower deliveries and the 5% reporting faster deliveries is the most bullish disparity in the two figures since August 1984, the survey said. The report said that while some of the slower deliveries can be attributed to the lingering effects of the recently settled steelworkers strike at USX Corp., there is considerable evidence that much of the change is the result of an improving economy.    The survey reported that production improved slightly in March over February. It said that for the second straight month the number of purchasing managers who reported better production was more than three times greater than those who reported a decline.    The association said that employment increased in March after the lengthy decline. It said that 16% of the purchasing managers reported higher employment, the greatest percentage since March 1985. It said that 14% reported lower employment, the lowest since September 1984. </TEXT></DOC>
