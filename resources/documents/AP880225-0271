SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The great Blizzard of 1888, which claimed 400lives and buried the Northeast in up to 55 inches of snow, probablywould be less destructive if it occurred in 1988, weather expertssay.   From Maine to the nation's capital, much of the U.S. populationcame to a halt beginning March 11, 1988. By the time the stormended, 72 hours after it started, about 400 people were dead, 200in New York City alone.   The official weather forecast, issued by the War Department'sSignal Service, had called for brisk winds and fair weather overthe Atlantic states when the brunt of the storm struck.   Today, classic ``northeasters'' of the type that caused the 1888storm are easier to predict, with satellite photos and complexcommunications able to track the storms as they form in the southand churn along the Atlantic coast, collecting moisture to dump assnow in the Middle Atlantic and Northeast states.   Using satellites and detailed computer models, forecasters todayshould be able to give two days warning of such a storm, saidHarlan Saylor, deputy director of the National MeteorologicalCenter in Camp Springs, Md.   In addition, he added, federal weather forecasters now work 24hours a day, every day. In 1888, forecast offices closed onweekends. On the weekend the blizzard began, the New Yorkforecaster closed the office on Saturday afternoon.   Today, too, the effect of even a massive storm like that acentury ago, a storm that buried Troy, N.Y. under 55 inches of snowand dumped 40 inches on Bennington, Vt., should prove lessdangerous to most Americans, according to weather historian DavidM. Ludlum.   ``One facet is that New York has subways now and people couldget about. The blizzard was one of the reasons that speeded upbuilding subways,'' he said in a telephone interview from hisPrinceton, N.J., office.   Indeed, trains stuck on New York City's elevated railways poseda major problem in 1888, with passengers often having to beevacuated on rickety wind-whipped ladders.   Judd Caplovich in the book, ``Blizzard! The Great Storm of'88,'' said the storm prompted many cities to turn to electricstreetcars, instead of the popular horse-drawn versions.   In another change at least partly spurred by the blizzard,Ludlum noted that today communications lines are underground.   ``In 1888, horsepower was the best that was available to clearsnow, now we have motor vehicles, of course,'' he added.   But, Ludlum said, ``the automobile adds another factor, whichwould make things a lot tougher because they can't get aroundunless it's plowed.''   Travel might not be as necessary now, since most people haverefrigerators and freezers to store food and central heating isavailable.   A hundred years ago, city residents lacked convenient foodstorage and most city families relied on daily trips to the marketfor supplies. Markets depended on regular deliveries to keep stockin place.   Farmers often were better off than their city cousins, at leastable to survive the isolation with stored food.   Adding to the misery was cold, and the fact that for manyfamilies heat depended on a coal stove, replenished by fuel boughtin a daily bucket from now closed and snowed-in stores.   A century ago workers who missed a day on the job lost pay, andcould well find their place filled by someone else when they didreturn _ there was little or no employment security.   The result was that thousands took to the streets on thatfrightening Monday, trudging to jobs or to try and find coal forheat or milk for the baby _ and for many it was their last trip.   Today, many businesses _ and even the federal government _ closeat the first hint of bad weather.   Eventually, Patrick Hughes wrote in the magazine``Weatherwise,'' the storm ``proved a financial blessing to thecity's poor. Any man or boy able to lift a shovel was able to makeat least double the normal laborer's wages. Street car companies,street cleaning agencies and many private organizations were givingwork to all at $2 or more a day.''   Though plows are available today, they still haven't eliminatedthe need for the hand-driven shovel.   Adding to the confusion during the 1888 storm was the lack ofcommunication as the hurricane-strength winds ripped down overheadtelegraph lines connecting major cities.   ``Foreign invaders could have come ashore at Annapolis orBaltimore during the Blizzard of '88. Officials in the nation'scapital would have been unaware and probably unable to do anythingabout it,'' Caplovich wrote.   He noted too that the blizzard brought ``White Monday'' to theNew York Stock Exchange. Only five stocks were traded that day,volume totaling 15,200 shares. The next day only 2,000 shareschanged hands.   Today, electronic signals easily pierce clouds and snow to carrynews and financial orders from city to city, unlike 1888 when NewYork could still communicate with London via the Atlantic cable,but not nearby cities.   The same storm today, though likely less damaging, could stillcause chaos. Major storms in New York in 1947 and Boston in 1978caused serious dislocations, for example, Ludlum said.   But they weren't the same.   ``There has been more snow, but never the combination of lowtemperatures, high winds and blowing snow. We've never had driftsquite like '88,'' Ludlum said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 28</NOTE></DOC>
