Gary Hovatter in atelephone interview.   He said exercises were taking place Tuesday at four sites.   President Reagan ordered 3,200 American troops to Honduras lastweek at the request of President Jose Azcona Hoyo, who had accusedSandinista soldiers from neighboring Nicaragua of penetratingHonduran territory in pursuit of U.S.-supported Contra rebels.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua denied his troops were inHonduras. Last week Honduran jets twice bombed Nicaraguan positionsto force them to leave. No casualties were reported.   Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras told TheAssociated Press in an interview Tuesday the border tension ``hasvirtually disappeared'' after both the Sandinistas and the Contrassuspended hostilities and began truce talks.   The three days of negotiations began Monday in the smallsouthern Nicaraguan town of Sapoa, near the Costa Rican border. Thetalks aim mainly at reaching a cease-fire so that both sides canstrike a permanent peace accord in their 7-year-old war.   The dispatch of the U.S. troops bolstered the American militarypresence in Honduras to about 6,000 servicemen. The Reaganadministration billed it as both a show of support for Azcona and awarning to the Sandinistas against further actions in the borderregion.   As the Sandinistas pulled out of the Bocay region, where theincursion took place, Azcona said the additional U.S. troops wouldnot be needed much longer.   Hovatter said, however, that the troops will complete theirtraining first. The United States has been carrying out jointexercises with the Honduran military periodically for five years aspart of the Reagan administration's policy of isolating theSandinistas.   Ten American soldiers were injured Monday when their UH-1 Hueyhelicopter crashed during an exercise near the southern Hondurantown of Juticalpa, apparently as a result of mechanical failure.   Hovatter said five or six of the injured soldiers would bereleased for light duty.</TEXT></DOC>
