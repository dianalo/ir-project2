Negative ions are efficiently and selectively formedby reactions of electrons with electronegative molecules. Since manyenvironmental contaminants form negative ions in this manner, the electroncapture detector is commonly used to measure these compounds. This bookcontains the ECNI mass spectra of 361 compounds measured at Indiana University.These compounds were selected to include the major classes of environmentalcontaminants such as those found on the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency's priority pollutant list. Compound classes of environmental importanceinclude halogenated benzenes and phenols; nitro-benzenes and the relateddinitro herbicides; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; halogenated biphenyls,dioxins, and dibenzofurans; DDT derivatives; and hexachlorocyclopentadienepesticides. The spectra, measured with the ion source at 100/sup 0/Cand 250/sup 0/C, are reported graphically. In addition, compound name,Chemical Abstract registry number, molecular weight, and the structureare given.</TEXT></DOC>
