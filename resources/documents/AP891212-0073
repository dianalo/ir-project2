ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   FDA Commissioner Frank Young, leaving afterthe worst scandal in the agency's history, said in a farewellspeech Tuesday that it is time for a new beginning at the FDA.   ``To fully get through this, though, FDA needs a littlebreathing room, some space as my son might say, to reassess itspriorities and to develop a strategy for the next decade,'' Youngtold the Food and Drug Law Institute's annual education conference.   He did not speak of his reason for leaving the job after 5{years, but said ``the acceptance of illegal gratuities by threeformer FDA employees ... has shamed and angered all 7,500 of us inthe agency.''   Sources inside and outside government have said they believeYoung was forced out because of the generic drug scandal thatuncovered fraud, corruption and mismanagement within the agency.   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services,told the group that he would not ``tolerate bribery, fraud or otherillegalities or improprieties'' and said he is directingestablishment of an advisory committee on the Food and DrugAdministration.   ``This advisory committee will explore current concerns aboutthe FDA and develop policy or structural recommendations to addressany problems they uncover,'' he said, giving the panel a year tomake its report.   Young will become deputy assistant secretary for health, scienceand environment. Young's old and new jobs are in the Public HealthService, which is part of HHS.   His farewell speech reflected some bitterness with recent eventsand the treatment generally of FDA, whose mission is to regulatequality, testing and approval of the nation's food andpharmaceuticals.   Young said FDA employees deserve more respect.   ``We've had enough, too much, of politicians who view civilservants as part of the problem,'' he said, adding that the agencyneeds competitive salaries and better facilities.   ``I am truly ashamed of the inadequate, poor facilities that weoccupy in 23 buildings located at seven sites around the city andsuburbs of Washington,'' Young said.   He called the bribery scandal ``an aberration in a longtradition of excellent service to the nation,'' and offered thisadvice:   _To special interest groups and their representatives: ``You'vegot to stop approaching FDA as if your special interest, yoursingle interest, were the only issue we face. You must begin tounderstand that not all public health issues are created equal,that your particular hobby horse may not be the FDA's No. 1 publichealth or regulatory problem, nor should it be.''   _To Congress: ``One concern I would raise is the tendency forCongress to act more like a cluster of individuals than alegislative body. It's as if the beautiful forest that we once knewhad been replaced by a group of individual trees.   ``The agency deserves the guarantee of no new responsibilitieswithout concomitant resources, (and) while FDA is most willing toaccept constructive criticism from the Congress such criticismshould be factually based and consistent with a reasonableassessment of agency priorities ... the agency should respectfullyask members of Congress to resist the temptation to grandstand onFDA issues.''   _To lawyers: ``When you approach the agency ... carry your owncredibility as well as your client's. If your client's case is astrong one, by all means argue strongly. But if your client's caseis a weak one, don't oversell.''   _To the president: ``The FDA is somewhat like a referee in afootball game. While most people cheer loudly for the home team,and a few even cheer for the visiting team, nobody ever cheers forthe referee. And yet, like the referee, FDA often has to make thedifficult calls _ and without the benefit of an instant replay.''</TEXT></DOC>
