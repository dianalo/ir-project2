An ABC executive said the lack of advertising reflectedcorporate concerns about public opposition to sex and violence ontelevision.   The show, ``Crimes of Passion II,'' had no advertisers as of theday before its scheduled Saturday broadcast, the network saidTuesday. ABC said ``in the best interests of the network and itsaffiliates,'' the show was replaced with two 1988 comedy pilots.   ``It happened because there is a sensitivity on the part ofadvertisers to programs of this nature,'' said Ted Harbert, seniorvice president of programming for ABC. ``That's clear, that'sobvious and that's growing.''   Executives at several major advertising agencies said they couldnot recall any previous network program that had failed to attractadvertising and was removed from the schedule.   A press release for the special, whose host was actor BruceDern, said it ``explores real-life cases in which people havecommitted an act of violence aimed against someone they love.'' Theprogram included two stabbings, a shooting and an incident in whicha man set fire to his wife.   The first ``Crimes of Passion'' was broadcast in October andgarnered a 13.2 rating and 23 share in the Wednesday time periodnow occupied by ``China Beach.'' By comparison, ``China Beach'' hada 12.2 rating and 21 share last week, according to the A.C. NielsenCo. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 90.4 millionhouseholds with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets inuse.   Though ``Crimes of Passion'' did reasonably well in the ratingslast fall, it was in a better time period than ``Crimes of PassionII.'' It would have been broadcast on Saturday night, when ABC'sratings are much lower. ``Livin' Large'' and ``Heart and Soul,''the replacement shows, were among last week's lowest-rated shows.   Had the show run without any paid advertising, it would not berated by Nielsen, and that would have hurt the network's affiliatedstations during the May sweeps period, when the ratings are used todetermine local advertising rates.   Earlier this season, advertisers pulled out of NBC's GeraldoRivera high-rated special on devil worship and others backed offNBC's satirical ``Saturday Night Live.'' A Michigan woman'scampaign against Fox's raunchy ``Married ... With Children''received publicity earlier this year. Fox says the relativelyhigh-rated show remains sold out nonetheless.</TEXT></DOC>
