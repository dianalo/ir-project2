GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soldiers armed with bayonets patrolledthe streets of the Burmese capital Saturday, and authorities beganselling food to counter soaring prices and hoarding, officials andtravelers said.   Thai and Western travelers returning to Bangkok from Rangoondescribed the city as quiet but tense, with armed soldiersstationed at street corners and small groups of people gathering todiscuss the country's troubles. Soldiers placed empty oil barrelsalong some streets to force vehicles to proceed slowly, they said.   Thousands of Burmese demonstrated in the past two weeks againstnewly-elected President Sein Lwin, who moved quickly to quash allpolitical dissent. He ordered the arrests of the most outspokencritics of the authoritarian system and several other people,including Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.   Sein Lwin was elected president and chairman of Burma's onlypolitical party after the resignation of Ne Win, a general whoseized power in 1962.   The president promised economic reforms, and authoritiesSaturday began selling such items as rice, cooking oil, salt andfish through various cooperatives units ``to help relieve manuallaborers and low-income earners affected by rising prices of basicfoodstuffs,'' the official Radio Rangoon reported.   The price of rice _ which one Western diplomat called a``barometer of tension'' in Burma _ has quadrupled over the pastfew months.   ``Farmers and traders are hoarding it because there's noconfidence in the present government,'' said the diplomat, whospoke on condition of anonymity. ``If that leads toshortages...that might trigger more violence.''   Rangoon-based diplomats link the price increases, hoarding offood and other economic hardships to the general tension in thecountry.   Sein Lwin has endorsed a package of reforms aimed at looseninggovernment control over the economy and attracting private foreigninvestment, which has been forbidden.   But diplomats in Rangoon and visitors to the capital in recentdays say Burmese businessmen appear to be skeptical of the proposedmeasures and fear another demonetization of the currency as asimplistic way to deal with inflation.   The government last fall suddenly withdrew several currencynotes from circulation without compensation, sparking riots andtalk among Burmese that the government had engaged in ``officialrobbery.''   Some businessmen reportedly say that the 64-year-old Sein Lwinmay push the reforms through in order to cling to power but believethere will be little follow-up to the measures, since the formermilitary officer is considered an old guard socialist.   Once regarded as a potential economic power in Southeast Asia,Burma's influence slipped under Sein Lwin's predecessor.   Over the past year, conditions have worsened and Burma _ with anannual per capita income of less than $200 and a $4 billion debt _was forced to apply to the United Nations for Least DevelopedDeveloping Country status.   Although the state in principle supports providing basic foodsupplies to its people through government-run stores andcooperatives, the population has had to rely in recent years on avast black market stocked with items smuggled from other Asiancountries.   However, residents say even the once plentiful goods onRangoon's ``free markets'' have disappeared recently, accompaniedby soaring prices.   The illegal trade has also deprived the government of badlyneeded revenue, with luxury items such as jade, rubies, gold, teak,cattle and antiques leaving the country in exchange for basicnecessities.</TEXT></DOC>
