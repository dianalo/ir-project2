National advertisers have shied away from newspapers because the advertising rates charged them are far higher than those charged local advertisers, such as stores. But 23 newspapers are planning to offer national packaged-goods advertisers lower rates that are closer to those charged local advertisers. Young andamp; Rubicam Inc., a closely held ad agency that coordinated the group and negotiated each newspaper's new rates, plans to announce the move today.    The move to lower rates, if successful, could help reverse the sagging advertising support that is dragging down, and even killing, some newspapers. Only about 6.3% of all national advertising dollars went into newspapers in 1985, according to McCann-Erickson Inc., an ad agency. That compares with 7.3% in 1975 and more than 15% in the early 1950s, the agency said.    &quot;We don't feel that we get our fair share of national advertising dollars,&quot; said Tony Calianese, senior vice president, advertising and marketing, of the New York Daily News, which first suggested rate cuts more than a year ago. &quot;There are millions of dollars per year of opportunity out there for the industry,&quot; he said.    &quot;Everyone is so enamored of dealing with the television stations that newspapers are treated as second-class citizens. We can't be complacent,&quot; said Pat Purcell, publisher of the New York Post and the Boston Herald. Those publications and the San Antonio (Texas) Express-News, all owned by News America Publishing Inc., are part of the group. News America is a unit of News Corp., which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch.    Some 44% of all national advertisers' dollars is spent on local media such as local television, according to Young andamp; Rubicam. Yet many national advertisers don't even bother with newspapers when searching out local media. &quot;We really haven't had much incentive to even consider using newspapers,&quot; said David K. Braun, director of media and program services for General Foods Corp., a large consumer advertiser and Young andamp; Rubicam client. &quot;The rate differential has been a real obstacle.&quot;    Newspapers charged national advertisers an average of 64.6% more than local advertisers in 1985, according to the American Association of Advertising Agencies. In the case of some big newspapers, the differential is far higher; the New York Post, for example, charges national advertisers more than double what it charges local retailers. The differential, which started as a way to give a break to small, &quot;mom and pop&quot; local retailers, has grown wider over the years; in 1975, for example, it was 50.3%.    Mr. Braun said that if the rates are lowered, advertisers might change their minds. &quot;I would certainly hope at a minimum that each of our brands would review and re-address the whole subject of newspapers now, knowing that this significant cost breakthrough has occurred,&quot; he said. He noted that newspaper advertising might make sense as an alternative to local television in markets where local television &quot;is overpriced.&quot;    Savings under the plan will vary. The Daily News said its new rate for national advertisers will be about one-third less than its current rate. The program will have an 18-month trial, probably starting in January, and it will only apply to packaged-goods advertisers who agree to buy at least 13 quarter-page ads a year.    The Daily News, owned by Chicago-based Tribune Co., initiated the rate-cutting idea in November 1985, when, in a meeting with Young andamp; Rubicam, it discussed cutting its own rates to attract national advertisers. But the ad agency noted that national advertisers wouldn't be interested in a single newspaper with lower rates. &quot;One paper doesn't represent a national opportunity. It's an opportunity only if you can buy (space) everywhere,&quot; Joe Ostrow, a Young andamp; Rubicam executive vice president, said.    Other newspapers involved include the New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and Dallas Times Herald. Newspapers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit, Philadelphia, Boston, Houston, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Denver, San Diego and Miami are also represented. </TEXT></DOC>
