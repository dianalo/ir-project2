With Kraft's diversified food businesses on board, he said, New York-based Philip Morris would be too big to insist that ad agencies avoid handling accounts of clients who are competitors.    For decades, advertising agencies have lived -- and sometimes died -- by promising clients they would avoid conflicts. If an agency took on one client, it knew it couldn't work for the client's competitors.    But with Philip Morris's $11.4 billion bid for Kraft, and Grand Metropolitan Co.'s $5.23 billion attempt to take over Pillsbury Co. -- and with a concurrent trend toward mergers in the advertising business -- the old rules may be on their way out.    In fact, some of Philip Morris's agencies already do work for competitors, Mr. Murray said, and &quot;we have lived with them and we have had no problems.&quot;    Mr. Murray shrugged off even the largest potential conflict if the Kraft acquisition goes through: Chicago-based ad agency Foote, Cone andamp; Belding Communications Inc. handles Kraft marshmallow and caramel products, but also is a major agency for Philip Morris's arch-competitor, RJR Nabisco Inc. &quot;I don't think that's a problem,&quot; Mr. Murray said. &quot;Look, our position is real simple. We try to get the best advertising we can. To us, that is far more important than anything else.&quot;    Philip Morris, which bought General Foods in 1985, has &quot;probably&quot; grown more liberal in its conflict policy as it has grown, Mr. Murray said. &quot;My guess is,&quot; he added, that the mega-mergers of food and other companies will lead advertisers to liberalize their conflict policies, too.    Even if Philip Morris is the only big advertiser to liberalize its conflict policy, though, its impact will be huge. Philip Morris recently surpassed Procter andamp; Gamble Co. to become the nation's largest advertiser, spending some $1.56 billion in 1987. Kraft itself was the 22nd-largest advertiser, spending $400.7 million; together, with an ad budget of almost $2 billion, they would create an unprecedented marketing behemoth encompassing everything from Marlboro cigarettes to Miller beer to Post cereals to Kraft salad dressing.    Executives at some of Philip Morris's ad agencies said privately that while Philip Morris will tolerate existing conflicts, they doubt it will let them pursue new business from its competitors. But a Philip Morris spokesman said, &quot;the only problems we would have would be classic product-to-product conflicts,&quot; in which, for example, an ad agency that handles its cigarettes tried to win RJR Nabisco's cigarette business. &quot;We're flexible other than that,&quot; he added.    Already, ad agency Young andamp; Rubicam Inc. handles Jello for Philip Morris's General Foods unit -- and also handles RJR Nabisco's Now, More and Premier cigarettes. WPP Group PLC's J. Walter Thompson Co. ad agency handles Philip Morris's Miller beer but also works for Kellogg Co., a big General Foods competitor. Leo Burnett Co., which handles Philip Morris's Marlboro cigarette advertising, also works for Kellogg. And ad agency D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles Inc. handles General Foods' Brim and Yuban coffees, but also creates ads for Anheuser-Busch Co.'s Budweiser beer, a major Miller competitor.    &quot;We have this (conflict) situation today, and if we are successful (in acquiring Kraft) I don't think it will change things very much,&quot; Philip Morris's Mr. Murray said.    Several ad agency executives said they see other signs that the conflict policy is weakening, at least with some clients. Keith Reinhard, chairman and chief executive officer of Omnicom Group Inc.'s DDB Needham advertising unit, noted that DDB Needham works for Volkswagen and Audi, while its sister agency BBDO handles Chrysler. He said there are &quot;16 to 18&quot; other similar cases, and added, &quot;I sense a loosening up.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
