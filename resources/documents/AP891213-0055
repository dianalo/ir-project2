(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal authorities investigatingillegal bingo gambling and public corruption reportedly wereclosing in on a top state official who was in critical conditiontoday after an apparent suicide attempt.   The Nashville Banner quoted unidentified sources Tuesday assaying investigators were focusing on how Secretary of State GentryCrowell solicited money for political campaigns from architects,engineers and bingo operators.   Crowell, 57, was found by his son, Brooks, on the porch of hishome in Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Nashville. Police saidCrowell apparently shot himself once in the mouth with a.38-caliber revolver, which was found next to him.   He left no note, and authorities would not say if they had anyleads as to his motive.   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents were investigating theshooting to make sure no foul play was involved, said DeputyDirector John Carney.   Doctors said Crowell's fate depended on how well he reacts toswelling and infection in his brain.   Neurosurgeons removed damaged brain tissue and a bullet from hisskull during more than four hours of surgery at VanderbiltUniversity Medical Center. The gunshot wound caused ``a lot ofbleeding and it destroyed a lot of tissue,'' said John C. Ross, thehospital's vice chancellor for health affairs.   ``It's impossible to know at this time what residual damagethere might be,'' Ross said.   ``The critical period now will be the next several days.''   Crowell has not been implicated in any wrongdoing, though partof the investigation has clouded his office.   His former chief bingo inspector, W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker,recently began a seven-year sentence at the federal prison inTalladega, Ala. The charges included extorting payoffs from bingooperators. And Crowell's former assistant, Mary Sue Wright,resigned in August before giving testimony before the U.S. grandjury in Memphis.   She was named an unindicted co-conspirator in a Memphis bingooperation and given immunity from prosecution. She has admittedtaking money from a Democratic legislative campaign fund,authorities said.   Bingo was outlawed in Tennessee this year after the stateSupreme Court ruled that the game is a lottery, in violation of thestate constitution.   Previously, it had been legal for charity fund-raising, butreports showed that bogus charities were set up and money skimmedfrom some operations.   Since January, 22 people have been indicted or pleaded guilty asa result of the investigation. They include state Rep. TommyBurnett, charged with conspiracy, gambling, mail fraud and perjury.Burnett has said he is innocent.   Sen. Robert Rochelle, a Democrat from Crowell's hometown, calledCrowell a private person who didn't talk about his problems.   But Rochelle pointed to the strain of news coverage inconnection with the federal investigation.   ``I wish these prosecutors would quit letting people hang outthere to try to get them to talk if they don't have enough evidenceto convict them,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
