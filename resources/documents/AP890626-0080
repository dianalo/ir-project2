RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today set aside a ruling thata key civil rights law does not protect aliens from discriminationby businesses or other private citizens.   The high court ordered a lower court to reconsider the case of aNew Orleans man from India who was denied a bank credit card becausehe is not a U.S. citizen.   The justices said the lower court should restudy the case inlight of the high court's June 15 ruling reaffirming that acentury-old civil rights law applies to alleged discrimination byprivate citizens.   The First National Bank of Commerce in New Orleans was accused ofillegal bias by Jeetendra Bhandari, a citizen of India who appliedfor a Visa or Master Card credit card in 1983.   Bank officials said they rejected Bhandari's application in partbecause he is not a U.S. citizen.   Bhandari, an accountant, sued the bank in federal court. Hecharged it with violating a post-Civil War law _ now commonlyreferred to as Section 1981 _ that prohibits racial discrimination.   The entire 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 7-6 vote,ruled last October that Section 1981 does not ban private acts ofdiscrimination against aliens.   Judge Thomas Gee, in his opinion for the court's majority, said,``Racial and citizenship distinctions are things of a differentkind. The latter is not so readily and roundly condemned.''   He added: ``When all is said and done, patriotism remains a civicvirtue; and one whose allegiance is bound to another nation may notbe suited for certain callings in ours. And while the alien guest isnot without his own special claims upon us, arising from our moraltradition, they are of a different quality from those grounded inour common humanity.''   The appeals court noted that at the time of its ruling there wasa split on the Supreme Court on whether Section 1981 bans privateacts of discrimination _ as opposed to bias practiced by government_ even against blacks or other racial minorities.   The high court announced on April 25, 1988, it would consideroverturning its own 1976 decision allowing people to use Section1981 to sue private citizens for race discrimination.   But on June 15 the justices upheld the 1976 ruling _ while alsodeciding that the 19th Century law does not permit suits chargingon-the-job racial harassment.   Also, the court in May 1987 expanded the scope of Section 1981 toinclude not only racial minorities but Jews, Arabs and other ethnicgroups as well.   Bhandari, in the appeal acted on today, said the 5th Circuitcourt dismissal of his suit conflicts with high court precedent.   The appeals court ruling ``presents a direct conflict with(Supreme Court) decisions holding that Section 1981 prohibitsdiscrimination against non-citizens based on alienage and thatSection 1981 prohibits discrimination in the making of privatecontracts,'' lawyers for Bhandari said.   The case is Bhandari vs. First National Bank of Commerce, 87-1293.</TEXT></DOC>
