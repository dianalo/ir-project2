As the Treasury bond market declined again, underwriters struggled to find buyers for many of the new securities.    Among the largest were:   --A $200 million issue of Ashland Oil Inc. debentures due October 2017. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. priced the debentures at par to yield 11 1/8%, or 1.35 percentage points more than the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017. The issue is rated single-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --A $150 million issue of Volkswagen Lease Finance Corp. four-year notes backed by automobile leases. Underwriters led by Dillon, Read andamp; Co. and Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. priced the 9 3/4% notes at 99.35 to yield 9.95%, or 0.58 percentage point more than the Treasury's new four-year note. The final maturity of the issue is October 1991.    --$100 million of Centrust Savings Bank mortgage-backed bonds due in 10 years. The bonds, which are noncallable, allow investors a one-time option of redeeming the issue at par in five years. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets headed the underwriting group. A Merrill Lynch spokesman said the 10% bonds were offered at variable prices. Initially, the issue was priced to yield 10.032%, which was 0.65 percentage point above five-year Treasury notes at that time, he said.    The Merrill Lynch spokesman also said the collateral for the bonds includes government agency securities and mortgages, and that it is guaranteed that no corporate securities or junk bonds will be substituted as collateral. The issue is rated triple-A by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal market, New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said the state, its major authorities and New York City will sell about $1.54 billion of new securities in this year's fourth quarter. He said $643.5 million is scheduled for sale this month, $517 million next month and $383 million in December. During last year's fourth quarter, $1.26 billion of debt was scheduled and $836 million was actually sold. </TEXT></DOC>
