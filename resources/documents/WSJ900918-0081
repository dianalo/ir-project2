It's not the Army, but it's close. It's drum and buglecorps, a passion that consumes tens of thousands of Americansbut is little known to anyone outside the world of marchingbands.</LP><TEXT>   But drum corps is not a marching band, as corps membersare quick to point out. A drum corps marches in a footballstadium, but not at halftime. Drum corps put on their ownshows, and perform only on silver bugles and assortedpercussion instruments. The music is more likely to be byDuke Ellington or Camille Saint-Saens than John Philip Sousa,and is specially scored in 11 1/2-minute arrangements.Instead of a baton twirler, there's a whole team called acolor guard that spins huge colored flags and does grandjetes across the AstroTurf. Drum corps has its roots inmarching band, but is more difficult, more demanding, andinfinitely more spectacular to watch.   A T-shirt sold at the World Championships at Rich Stadiumhere this summer took up the issue. &quot;Why drum corps is betterthan marching band,&quot; the shirt announced, and listed thereasons, including &quot;SPANDEX]&quot; Spandex is used in thetight-fitting uniforms of the color guard, usually youngwomen. Drum corps, in other words, is sexy and wild and fun.   Or is it?   Over on the playing field under the hot sun, therehearsing buglers of Star of Indiana, from Bloomington, playno tunes. They blow silently in set rhythms, then play asingle &quot;G&quot; for a while, and eventually, work up to afour-note scale -- over the course of 50 minutes. On thetrack, 30 nubile women in bikini tops and short shorts twirlpurple-and-yellow banners as if they were no heavier thandime-store pinwheels. Their male instructor chews them out.&quot;Laurie] Too parallel]&quot; &quot;Tara] You're slicing down to theright]&quot;   It's one day before the world championships, and 20bare-chested male drummers are repeating a single drill overand over. They send out drumbeats like rifle shots andscamper across the grass like Olympic crabs, forward,backward and sideways.   &quot;If we don't play something right, we go over and over ituntil it's right. Even if it's one note,&quot; says ShariSpradling, a mellophone player. &quot;They tell us to picturesomething as perfect and then try to achieve it.&quot;   Achieving perfection isn't easy. The top corps practice 10hours a day, six and seven days a week all summer, on one 111/2-minute piece.   Corps members, ages 14 to 21, pay $200 to $1,000 to spendmost of their summer vacation on the road, traveling to showssponsored by the competition, sleeping in buses and on gymfloors (girls on one side, boys on the other, couples head tohead along the invisible but definite dividing line). Star ofIndiana, like most of the top corps, has its own buses, asemitrailer outfitted as a kitchen, and another semi to haulequipment. Dining is alfresco around the school parking lot.&quot;I get homesick for normal life sometimes, like not to sit ona street curb,&quot; admits the otherwise enthusiastic Ms.Spradling, age 21.   Drum corps, says Star of Indiana executive director BobLendman, &quot;is a combination army, circus and gypsy caravan.&quot;It's also habit-forming; most of the teachers, drilldesigners and support staff, both professional and volunteer,have been spending their summers in drum corps since theywere teenagers.   &quot;It's a ridiculous activity,&quot; says Glen Crosby, percussioninstructor for the Santa Clara (Calif.) Vanguard. &quot;Even aprofessional sports team doesn't work this hard. Once you geteverything right -- the music and the drills -- you stillhave the attitudes of the music you have to get across --while people are running around the field.&quot;   The tenor drummers, for instance, each carry five drums ona harness and must learn to play perfectly in sync with theothers in their section while blocking out all other sounds,because of the distortion caused by distance. Becauseeverybody's always on the move, the drummers have to watchthe conductor's beat and decide whether to come in on time,early or late, depending on how far they are from theconductor at a given moment. Meanwhile, they're moving attempos of as much as 200 beats per minute and trying toconvey the charged emotions of a gypsy girl, a guilelesstoreador and a lovesick soldier. Santa Clara Vanguard'smusical selection was Bizet's &quot;Carmen,&quot; which earned thetroupe sixth prize this year (in 1989 it came in first withAndrew Lloyd Webber's &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;).   The corps are judged on execution of the music and drillsas well as the quality of the show, musically and visually.Three of the nine judges move around the field to get aclose-up view; the rest are up in the press box, where, asevery corps knows, the sound from 60-plus buglers aimingpoint-blank and blowing with gale force tends to quicken alistener's heartbeat and send a few shivers on a hot Augustnight.   This wall of sound is particularly impressive when themarchers break from the amoebalike shapes, the ellipses,figure eights, wedges and squares that they've been drawingon the field, and form a single horizontal line called acompany front. As the front moves forward, the crowdinvariably cheers. It's a thrilling, momentary union of sightand sound.   The company front is one of the few remaining militarytraditions in an activity that began when World War Iveterans formed drum and bugle corps to perform in paradesand keep patriotism alive. The VFW, American Legion posts andCatholic churches were the first sponsors, but by the '60s,corps had become so active and expensive that, with patrioticand church fervor on the wane, the sponsors pulled out. Manycorps disbanded, but hundreds kept themselves afloat withall-out community fund drives. With the formation of DrumCorps International, a nonprofit service organization, in1971, the activity became more sophisticated andstandardized, but not necessarily more stable. While SantaClara Vanguard generates more than $1 million through its ownbingo hall, and Star of Indiana enjoys the sponsorship ofCook Group Cos., the other corps still scramble to make theminimum $200,000 to $300,000 necessary to put one of theseshows on the road.   There are 450 or so corps in North America, of which 185compete. Each corps tends to develop a personality. TheVelvet Knights from Anaheim are irreverent and veryCalifornia: They like to abandon the drill and run likemaniacs around the field, and twirl lawn chairs instead offlags. The Cadets of Bergen County (N.J.), who took firstplace this year with an all-Bernstein program, are known fortheir superior marching abilities. The second-place Cavaliersof Rosemont, Ill., are all-male and crisply regimental. TheBlue Coats from Canton, Ohio, always play jazz; the PhantomRegiment from Rockford and Loves Park, Ill., prefersclassical music.   This year Phantom put together a show of assortedSaint-Saens, proving that there is truly nothing like thesound of 96 musicians on soprano, mellophone, baritone,euphonium and contrabass bugles, tenor and bass drums,cymbals, timpani, xylophones, marimbas, bells and variousother percussion instruments delivering the Organ Symphony --accompanied by shouts of &quot;Kick it]&quot; and &quot;Dawg]&quot;   ---   Ms. Orgill is the music critic of the Record in BergenCounty, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
