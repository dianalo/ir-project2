The results for N/sub 2/O-CO, CO/sub 2/-CO, N/sub2/O-H/sub 2/O and CO/sub 2/-H/sub 2/O mixtures are presented. Additionsof CO to the N/sub 2/O lasant increased power up to 28 percent for N/sub2/O laser mixture, whereas additions of CO to the CO/sub 2/ lasant andthe addition of H/sub 2/O to both the CO/sub 2/ and N/sub 2/O lasantsresulted in decreased output power.</TEXT></DOC>
