(The Executive Computer) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lewis, Peter H.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Codenoll Technology Corp introduces a networking system that usesplastic fiber-optic cabling.andP;  The plastic system, demonstrated atComdex/Fall in Nov 1990, is less expensive, easier to install andless fragile than conventional cabling.andP;  Codenoll representativessay they foresee a time when their product is as cost-effective ascopper wire.andP;  Codenoll's partner in developing the plastic cablingis Packard Electric, which is a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.andO;Fiber-optic cables have advantages over copper: fiber-opticnetworks are immune to electrical interference from otherelectrical equipment, and fiber optics cannot be 'tapped.' Plasticfiber-optics systems solve various problems of glass: plasticfibers are unbreakable, and they are much easier to install thanglass.andP;  The next step, according to Brian J. Ramsey, director ofmarketing at Codenoll, is to raise the speed of plastic fibers tomatch glass.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Codenoll Technology Corp.
