Temperature dependences of the enthalpy,heat capacity, entropy, and corrected Gibbs energy of the investigatedcompounds were obtained and are recommended for practical use. It wasestablished that enthalpy and heat capacity decrease from PrS to PrS{sub2} due to an increase in the degree of covalence of the sulfides withan increase in the ratio [S]/[Pr].</TEXT></DOC>
