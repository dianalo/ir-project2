The product, Marogen Sterile Powder, is a treatment for anemia caused by endstage renal disease, a kidney malfunction that often limits production of red blood cells. Marogen contains a protein, erythropoietin, that helps make red blood cells. Anemia is a condition in which there is a reduction of the number of red blood corpuscles or the total amount of hemoglobin in the blood stream or both, causing paleness and generalized weakness.    Marogen is made by Chugai under a license from Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass. Upjohn will be the distributor of Marogen in the U.S. Upjohn definitively agreed last March to market Chugai's drugs in the U.S. through a new company called Chugai-Upjohn Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
