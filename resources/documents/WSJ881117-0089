News developments hammered the stocks of several actual targets of announced bids, forcing takeover players to bail out of dozens of other issues amid concern about the overall climate for big deals. The selling accelerated in response to a falling dollar and a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about higher interest rates and the buildup of public and private debt.    &quot;Things look like they're breaking apart,&quot; said Hugh Lamle, co-head of arbitrage at M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc. &quot;People are scared to death today of Greenspan not liking leverage in the system.&quot;    RJR Nabisco Inc. led the decline on the news before the market opened that a group led by Forstmann Little andamp; Co. is no longer considering upping the ante in the $21 billion brawl for the tobacco and food company. Its stock plunged by $4.50 a share to close at $84.    Shares of Pillsbury Co. also tumbled $2 to $56 on the disclosure that Grand Metropolitan PLC is threatening to lower its $60-a-share bid if the food company goes ahead with its plan to spin off its Burger King fast-food unit.    The next shock came when the Rales brothers announced just after the market opened that they wouldn't accept shares tendered under their $74-a-share bid, due to expire at midnight last night, for Interco Inc.    The Rales move further clouded the picture for leveraged buy-outs, because their bid was to have been partly financed with junk bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Moreover, traders said there were recurring rumors about the prospect of indictments or settlements in the government's Drexel investigation.    Those were among the most prominent of a group of stocks subject to announced bids that slumped amid concerns about deals in general. They included Hospital Corp. of America, down $2.125 to $45.875; West Point-Pepperell Inc., down $1.625 to $41.50; TW Services Inc., down $1.125 to $22.375; and Prime Computer Inc., down 75 cents to $17.    Traders said the sudden downdraft in RJR triggered sales of other deal stocks, as takeover speculators scrambled to raise cash to cover losses in positions they had borrowed money to open. &quot;You strangle the guys with a 'down 4' in Reynolds, and it makes them run for cover,&quot; said one takeover-stock player. &quot;A lot of guys were looking for money.&quot;    Martin Weinstein, another takeover-stock player, worried over the implications of the Forstmann pullout from the RJR contest. &quot;This suggests that there aren't as many real buyers. The world is just not full of buyers.&quot;    One contributor to yesterday's weakness was that there have been so many deals, both real and rumored, that they are straining the capacity of the arbitrage community to own them all. &quot;The people who own the deal stocks are already filled up. You've got $20 billion chasing $80 billion of deals,&quot; said Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital Corp. in New York.    Whisper stocks, or rumored takeover targets, which have been struggling since last week, also faltered. They included: McGraw-Hill Inc., down $2.50 to $58.125; Polaroid Corp., down $1.625 to $34.50; Time Inc., down $2.125 to $97.375; MCA Corp., down $1.125 to $43.875, and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., down $1.625 to $40.    Still, some traders said they thought that yesterday's selling presented a good chance to buy downtrodden stocks.
