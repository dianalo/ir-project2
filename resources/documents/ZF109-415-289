Consequently, chipvendors want scan design standards and performance benchmarks.andO;The IEEE 1149.1 Joint Test Action Group developed a boundary scanstandard, but it does not 'address internal scan ...andP;  test vectorformatting or benchmarking.' 'Novel and impressive' scantechniques from ATandamp;T, Vertex Semiconductor and Racal-Redac Incwere discussed at the meeting.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Conferences and MeetingsScanningTestingApplication-Specific Integrated CircuitsStandardsCircuit DesignOn-Board SystemsSystem DevelopmentMethods.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Testability roadmap.
