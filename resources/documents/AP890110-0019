ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When President-elect Bush sits down later thisweek with his Cabinet choices, the question is whether there will bean empty seat at the table.   A top adviser conceded Monday that the search for a Secretary ofEnergy has proven more difficult than the transition teamanticipated.   Craig Fuller, vice presidential chief of staff as well asco-director of the transition, said it was taking longer to fill thejob because ``there are real technical difficulties and it's fraughtwith a lot of political problems.''   One of the political problems was the furor that knocked JamesSchlesinger, an early choice for the post, out of contention.   Fuller acknowledged that Gov. William Clements of Texas, amongothers, strongly opposed the choice of Schlesinger, defensesecretary under President Ford and energy secretary under PresidentCarter. Schlesinger and Clements became bitter enemies when theywere the two top Pentagon officials.   But Fuller insisted that Clements ``did not cause anybody to beput on or be taken off the list by himself.''   A new name circulating for the energy post was Harold Brown,defense secretary under Carter.   Fuller said Bush planned to meet with his Cabinet designees onThursday. The president-elect has named people to head 13 of the 14Cabinet departments.   One top adviser who turned down an offer of a White House jobafter weeks of agonizing was pollster Robert M. Teeter, who informedBush that for personal and family considerations he preferred toremain in Michigan.   In a statement announcing his decision, Teeter said he hadplanned to return home after the presidential campaign. Although theoffer of a White House post ``presented me with a very difficultdecision,'' Teeter said, ``I have decided to stand by my originaldecision.''   Fuller said Teeter, who recently sold his share in the pollingfirm Market Opinion Research, would ``be available forconsultation'' on strategic planning, message and themes.   Fuller, who had hoped to be named White House chief of staff,also is returning to private business. He and Teeter have beenco-directors of the transition.   The chief of staff job went to New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu.   Bush spoke to political supporters on Monday and urged them toact as talent scouts to fill thousands of administration jobs.   ``We are staffing a mandate,'' Bush told the PresidentialPersonnel Advisory Committee. ``That mandate isn't a set of issuesand policies picked out of a hat or chosen at random since Nov. 8.   ``It's a program we've run a winning national campaign on, aprogram ratified in the light of intense national examination.''   Bush said that ``talk about an issue-less, mandate-less electionis unfair to the intelligence of the American people.''   ``Voters had strong opinions on the most important issues facingthis country in the years to come,'' he said. ``Where they agreedmore with my opponent on the issues he won their votes and wherethey agreed more with me, I did.''   He went on to point out he defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis bynearly 7 million votes while carrying 40 states.   He said he was ``looking for men and women _ Republicans andDemocrats alike _ who understand what we understand about ElectionDay 1988.''   Bush said he was ``particularly concerned that our search reachregions, the men and women in America who are too often overlookedin such efforts, Americans who _ let's be frank _ our party hasperhaps done too little to include in the past.''   ``I want them too,'' he said. ``Black Americans, HispanicAmericans, Asian Americans, disabled Americans. Not as tokens, butas talent. Not for show, but for strength of character and forskill.''</TEXT></DOC>
