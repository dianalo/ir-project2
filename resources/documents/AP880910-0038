(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hurricane Florence moved across the tip ofLouisiana and headed toward the Mississippi Gulf Coast on Fridaynight, flogging coastal communities with 80 mph winds as thousandsof residents fled to higher ground. An Alabama man preparing forthe storm drowned while trying to tie down a boat.   Winds were well below the 100 mph predicted while Florence wasoffshore.   ``When it's a hurricane I get out,'' said Melodia Buras, ofBoothville, La., who joined about 500 others Friday night at BelleChasse High School, which was opened as a shelter for Venice andother Plaquemines Parish towns in coastal Louisiana.   Shortly before midnight, the National Weather Servicediscontinued its hurricane watch for western coast of Louisianafrom Morgan City to the Texas line.   At 11 p.m., the center of the 250-mile wide storm was about 60miles southeast of New Orleans, over the Mississippi Delta. Theweather service said it was moving north at 12-15 mph and its eyewas expected to continue in that direction and wind speed ovenight.   The eye, about 30 miles wide, was expected to sideswipe easternNew Orleans and hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast about 4 a.m.   Forecasters warned coastal residents to prepare for 9-foot tidesand up to 10 inches of rain. Tornado watches were posted fromPensacola, Fla., to Lake Charles, La.   A Coast Guard helicopter had to abandon plans to rescue four menon work barges trapped at the mouth of the Mississippi River, saidCoast Guard spokesman Dan Dewell. He said wind speeds there were atover 90 mph.   ``It looks like they're going to have to ride it out. Thehurricane, as well as I can make out, is right about there,'' saidDewell.   Earlier, a Coast Guard helicopter rescued two fishermen who gotinto trouble while running their crab traps, also near the mouth ofthe river.   In Alabama, police in the coastal community of Orange Beach saida 32-year-old man drowned Friday afternoon when he fell into thewater as he was trying to tie down a boat in windy, rainyconditions.   ``They were trying to secure a boat and one of their lines gotcaught up underneath it,'' Cpl. Marvin Glass said. He said the man,who could not swim, lost his balance tugging on the snagged lineand fell into a bayou, about half a mile from the Gulf.   Luke Petrovich, Plaquemines Parish Council president, said thatas Florence passed over the Mississippi Delta parish, it knockedout power to the homes of some 7,000 residents. About 1,600 ofthose residents moved into evacuation centers. Others soughtshelter with friends and family on higher ground.   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis postponedindefinitely an outdoor rally at New Orleans' Jackson Square aswell as two indoor fund-raisers: a $1,000-per-couple cocktail partyand a $10,000-per-couple buffet.   Florence, which had been stalled in the Gulf of Mexico, suddenlystrengthened into a hurricane Friday morning and began churningnorthward at 15 mph, the National Hurricane Center reported.   Maximum sustained wind speed near the storm's center was 80 mphat 11 p.m., well over the 74 mph threshhold at which a tropicalstorm is designated a hurricane, said Bob Sheets, director of thehurricane center.   An estimated 10,000 Mississippi coast residents moved to higherground, with more in Alabama and Louisiana, and students in partsof Louisiana and Alabama were dismissed from classes early inpreparation for the hurricane.   Evacuation shelters opened at late afternoon in the four states.   Some Friday night high school football games were canceled.   But not everyone was heading for higher ground. Curtis Mallon,who lives on the tiny Dauphin Island, a barrier island off theAlabama coast, said he wasn't leaving.   ``Once you make up your mind to stay, all you can do is stay,''Mallon said, boarding up his house.   The training aircraft carrier USS Lexington, based at PensacolaNaval Air Station, put out to sea Friday morning to ride out thestorm, said Navy spokeswoman Margaret Flowers.   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt declared a state of emergency Friday.Alabama Emergency Management Director J. Danny Cooper said thedeclaration would allow officials to cope with the potential sideeffects of the hurricane, including the need for public sheltersand the possibility of tornadoes and flash floods.   Cooper said motel space as far north as Montgomery had beenfilled by evacuees.   Mississippi Lt. Gov. Brad Dye, acting in behalf of Gov. RayMabus, who was out of state, also declared a state of emergency toactivate the Mississippi Emergency Operations Center, which willcoordinate any needed clean up.   From Taiwan, where he was on an industry-seeking mission,Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer ordered the National Guard to stand byfor emergency duty.   Boat owners moved their vessels to safe harbors.   ``We've put everything we've got on land into the water. We tieit good so if the tide goes up the boat goes up,'' said RandySpeas, manager of Dog River Marina, south of Mobile, Ala.   `We began evacuating the harbors Thursday and we are now in fullbore,'' said Wade Guice, who has headed Harrison County, Miss.,civil defense for three decades. ``Shelters will be up and we'll bedoing all the other things we usually do when a hurricanethreatens.''   In Louisiana, workers closed storm gates on bayous and canalsleading inland toward more heavily populated areas, beginning tobutton up gaps in the ring of levees that surround metropolitan NewOrleans.   The levees and big pumps keep the saucer-shaped New Orleans areadry. At its highest point, New Orleans is about 14 feet above sealevel. Much of it is below sea level.   Exactly 23 years ago Hurricane Betsy pushed a storm surge overlevees and flooded the eastern end of New Orleans, killing 70people in Louisiana and causing $1.1 billion in damages.   ``We have a more improved levee system and hurricane protectionsystem than we had 20 years ago,'' said Plaquemines ParishPresident Luke Petrovich. ``We tripled the capacity of our drainagepump systems and we've increased the height of our levees by about20 percent.''   At Grand Isle, La., a sandy strip just off the coast southwestof New Orleans, Mayor Andy Valence ordered residents to evacuate.   ``If they don't move out they will be arrested,'' Valence said.``They will not be detained, but they will get a citation.''   Residents in the affected areas were fortunate that strong windhad stalled Florence on Thursday, preventing it from strengtheningfor a day, forecaster Mark Zimmer said.   ``It could have been worse,'' he said, noting that earlySeptember is the height of the hurricane season, when wind and warmwater conditions are ideal for storm development.   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic season, isthe second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal hurricanestrength briefly before hitting the coast of Mexico last month.</TEXT></DOC>
