It said &quot;allavailable preventive measures should be used to minimizeoccupational exposure.&quot;   Those measures include banning smoking outright orrestricting it to enclosed, separately ventilated areas, theagency said.</LP><TEXT>   The report is likely to persuade many employers to toughenrestrictions on smoking, said Bryan Hardin, who supervisedthe NIOSH report's preparation. It also will help theOccupational Safety and Health Administration establishregulations for smoking in the workplace, he said.   Roy Clason Jr., OSHA's director of policy, said the NIOSHreport had just been received and was under review. &quot;We takeNIOSH's projects and data very seriously when we move forwardon any potential areas of rule-making,&quot; he said.   The institute recommended that employers and unions shouldcooperate to eliminate smoking, establish smoking-cessationprograms and offer workers incentives to stop smoking.   In the absence of a ban, employers should establishseparately ventilated smoking areas and the &quot;air from thisarea should be exhausted directly outside and notrecirculated within the building,&quot; the report said.   Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute inWashington, D.C., criticized the research linking second-handsmoke and cancer, and said that studies show workers aren'texposed to substantial amounts of cigarette smoke on the job.   The report, &quot;Environmental Tobacco Smoke in theWorkplace,&quot; is an 18-page review and analysis of existingresearch on second-hand cigarette smoke. It said the weightof the evidence &quot;is sufficient to conclude that{environmental tobacco smoke} poses an increased risk of lungcancer and possibly heart disease to occupationally exposedworkers.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
