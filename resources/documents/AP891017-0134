WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's plan to fighturban poverty with economic enterprise zones ran into skepticsTuesday in the House Ways and Means Committee, where Democratsquestioned the cost and said big new tax breaks would benefit thewealthy.   ``I think we have to be persuaded by more than yourenthusiasm,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., told Kemp as the secretarymade his familiar pitch for enterprise zones. ``I'm not convincedthe ... enthusiasm makes much sense.''   ``I hope there's more here than just enthusiasm,'' respondedKemp. ``I didn't come here to be a cheerleader.''   Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, appearedbefore the tax-writing committee to push the administration's planfor a program of tax incentives aimed at attracting new businessinvestment to designated areas of economic blight.   The administration's proposal _ also sponsored with DemocraticRep. Charles Rangel of New York _ would start with 50 such zonesphased in over four years. In an effort to win the support ofrural-district legislators such as Dorgan, its sponsors haveprovided for a portion of the zones to be designated for depressedrural areas.   The proposal would eliminate the capital gains tax on tangibleassets within the zones, provide investors with a $50,000 per yeartax deduction for new equity investment and provide an income taxcredit for low-income wage-earners.   Kemp has frequently boosted the plan in appearances beforeCongress, as it is a centerpiece of his plan to use privateenterprise to fight poverty. On Tuesday, he told the panel itrepresented not ``trickle-down'' economics but ``a Niagra Falls''of economic growth.   Kemp estimated the cost at $1 billion over four years. Rep. J.J.Pickle, D-Texas, said the total cost when more zones are addedcould be much higher, and said Congress has ``apprehension and fear... that once this starts, the cost will go out of bounds.''   ``The cost is the thing we've got to face,'' Pickle said.``Otherwise, the committee is going to have reservations.''   Kemp said the cost would ``not get out of bounds.''   Kemp's plan won support from many Republican members, but Rep.Don Pease, D-Ohio, charged the program would ``generate enormoustax benefits for the wealthy.''   ``Why do we have to help poor people by first helping wealthypeople?'' he said.   Kemp said the tax breaks would benefit investors but that theirmoney, invested in the zones, would provide jobs and opportunityfor the poor. ``I want to give other people a chance to get rich,''he said.   Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., questioned how sponsors couldjustify a program that would provide benefits to businesses on oneend of a street but not on the other.   ``If you can prove to us this is a worthwhile project, Icertainly would join with my colleagues to initiate at least apilot program,'' Rostenkowski told Kemp.</TEXT></DOC>
