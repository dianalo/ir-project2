It's not the first theater adaptation of the PulitzerPrize-winning novel by John Steinbeck, but the Steppenwolf TheaterCompany production at the Royal-George Theater, which closes Oct.30, is certainly the most expensive. The $500,000 project also hasthe enthusiastic support of Elaine Steinbeck, the author's widow.   The play stars two of the Steppenwolf troupe's biggest names,Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney, as well as guest artist Lois Smith asthe indomitable Ma Joad.   ATandamp;T picked up part of the tab for the three-hour productionwhich has a cast of 41, including four musicians who play anoriginal score by Michael Smith. They perform on a spare,wooden-plank setting designed by Kevin Rigdon, who also did thecostumes and lighting. The rough-hewn set covers the floor and backwall of the large stage.   But the man most responsible for the play, as well as itsdirection, is Frank Galati, a Chicago jack of all-theatrical tradeswho acts, writes, directs and teaches. The 44-year-old Galati firstread ``The Grapes of Wrath'' in high school.   ``It affected me in a number of ways that I've only begun tounderstand in the last couple of years,'' he said. ``It turned mein the direction of literature, and my whole academic life as astudent and as a teacher has been involved in the study offiction.''   Galati began adapting novels for the stage as a teacher atNorthwestern University, where he directed a summer program thattook students through the process.   One novel he wanted to adapt was ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' but hecouldn't get the rights. The idea lay dormant until Sinise, at thetime Steppenwolf's artistic director, invited Galati to submitsuggestions for possible productions.   ``I thought `The Grapes of Wrath' would offer wonderfulopportunities for an ensemble of exceptional actors,'' Galati said.Sinise, who had had some success with a production of Steinbeck's``Of Mice and Men'' a few years earlier, agreed.   The Steinbeck estate, after extended negotiations, grantedpermission. By January of this year, Galati had done two drafts andbegan a third version after Randall Arney, Steppenwolf's artisticdirector and Stephen Eich, its managing director, decided to openthe company's fall season with the work.   How does one boil down a sprawling novel of 30 chapters andnearly 600 pages? Galati started with a careful rereading.   ``I needed to see the flow of the book,'' he said,``particularly, those incidents and episodes and characters thatcome to the surface as tent poles, a kind of spine on which therest of the action hangs.''   The novel, Galati says, is kind of an American ballad, and posesparticular problems for a dramatist.   ``On stage you're stuck with having to get a truck full of 13people from Oklahoma to California by moving it a few feet,'' hesaid. ``That compression, and telescoping and distortion of timeand space is a very significant problem.   ``The book has an A-B, A-B form of alternating chapters that gofrom the general to the specific. Steinbeck does a kind oflandscape painting. Voice by voice, you get the sense of the greatnumbers of characters who are part of the epoch he was reflecting _the migrant workers, the land bosses, the contractors, the labororganizers, the businessmen. You also get a panorama of the DustBowl _ Highway 66 from Oklahoma to California.''   These broad scenes alternate with the stories of the Joadfamily, their immediate concerns and the characters they meet.   ``Steinbeck had a remarkable way, and very experimental for itstime, of letting scenes take their own natural time,'' Galati said.``People in the novel don't come to conclusions quickly. There aresome cataclysmic scenes and events, of course, but very oftendialogue and rhetoric move at a leisurely pace which I wasinterested in retaining without sacrificing the need for urgency inthe drama.''   Galati needed to find a framework to dramatize the more generalchapters. He found his answer in music.   ``I contacted Smith, a wonderful Chicago composer and folksinger, and gave him sections of the novel that I had condensedinto lyrics and asked him to set those lyrics to music which he didover the course of the summer,'' Galati says.   Have their efforts paid off?   The major Chicago reviews were divided about the show's merits.In the Chicago Sun-Times, Hedy Weiss called the production``breathtaking and emotionally wrenching ... it would be anunpardonable sin if it did not receive an extended life, both inthis country and abroad.'' Although the Chicago Tribune's RichardChristiansen described the play as ``reverent'' and ``ambitious,''he said ``admiration for its effort must give way to disappointmentin its results.''   Galati feels ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' both as a novel and astage play, holds a particular relevance for people in 1988.   ``There is this uncanny coincidence of the summer droughtdevastating American agriculture,'' he says. ``And there's thetheme of literally sacrificing the land, abusing and destroying theenvironment for the sake of capital gains. And we've still gotmigrant workers as the lowest rung of the social and economicladder. Those themes remain as resonant today as they were in1939.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
