Oil prices settled mixed, however. On other markets, gold andsilver futures advanced; soybean futures were sharply higher whilethe grains were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; andstock-index futures retreated.   The contract for April delivery of platinum settled $6.90 higherat $504.20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The move markedonly the second time since Jan. 20 that the April platinum contracthas finished above the psychologically important $500 barrier.   Analysts said gains Monday in all the precious metals _platinum, gold, silver and palladium _ were driven primarily by asharp increase in crude oil futures prices early in the day.   But when oil prices later fell steeply, the metals gave up onlysome of their gains, indicating other supportive factors were atwork.   The weak dollar, increased U.S. auto sales and the generallypositive tone of recent economic data are all bullish for metalsprices, said Jacques Luben, executive director of investments forthe Platinum Guild International.   ``It seems as though the consensus is that interest rates willremain relatively low for the remainder of the year, we may seehigher inflation and we probably won't see a recession this year,''Luben said.   Monday's performance was ``a reassuring vote of confidence forthe metals'' but the next few sessions will show just how deep thatconfidence runs, said Jack Barbanel, director of futures tradingfor Gruntal andamp; Co. in New York.   ``We're either at the early stage of some new buying momentum orwe're seeing an upside correction in a downside metals market,'' hesaid.   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $4.90 to $7.20higher with April at $449.20 a troy ounce; silver was 8 cents to10.3 cents higher with March at $6.447 a troy ounce.   Crude oil's early jump above $17 a barrel on the New YorkMercantile Exchange was triggered partly by speculation that OPECPresident Rilwanu Lukman would announce a meeting of OPEC's pricingcommittee at a Tuesday news conference, said Nauman Barakat, ananalyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   But prices came tumbling down later in the session when SaudiArabia's King Fahd confirmed the country was ``offering discounts,quite indiscriminately, to almost everybody,'' Barakat said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 8cents higher with April at $16.49 a barrel; heating oil was .12cent lower to .35 cent higher with April at 45.40 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was unchanged to .12 cent higher with April at46.11 cents a gallon.   Soybean and corn futures settled sharply higher on the ChicagoBoard of Trade while wheat prices fell.   Soybean futures rose early in the session on rumors of newSoviet buying and got a boost later in the day when theagricultural newsletter Safras y Mercado dropped its Braziliansoybean crop estimate by 400,000 metric tons due to dry weather,said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Wheat settled 2} cents lower to { cent higher with March at$2.96\ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4} cents higher with March at$2.01{ a bushel; oats were 5{ cents lower to { cent higher withMarch at $1.90{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 10 cents higherwith March at $6.30 a bushel.   Frozen pork belly futures settled sharply lower on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange while livestock futures were mixed.   The drop in pork belly futures was largely due to expectations,later confirmed, of a sharp increase in bellies in cold storage.The USDA announced after the close that nearly 67 million pounds ofpork bellies were stored in the nation's freezers on Feb. 29,compared to 34.7 million pounds a year ago.   Sharply lower cash hog prices weighed on the livestock futures,said Walter Kowalski, an analyst in Chicago with Lind-Waldock andamp; Co.   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .50 cent higher with Aprilat 73.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .10cent higher with March at 82.70 cents a pound; hogs were .65 centlower to .10 cent higher with April at 45.55 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were unchanged to 1.70 cents lower with March at 54.10cents a pound.
