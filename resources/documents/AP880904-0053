(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker offered assurances Sunday he'llhave the money this week to back up his $165 million offer for PTL.   Bakker said in a telephone interview from his Fort Mill officethat he has been working 15-hour days in anticipation of regainingthe TV ministry he left in 1987 in a sex and money scandal.   ``We have made quite a few contacts'' with bankers, Bakker said.``When the contracts (to take over PTL) are ready, we'll have themoney to back it up.''   He said he hopes he and his wife, Tammy, will be back on the airon Sept. 12.   On Friday, PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said hewas ``very, very skeptical'' about whether Bakker would come upwith the cash to back up his offer. If Bakker does not have a $3million letter of credit by Tuesday, Benton said, he will startconsidering other offers for the ministry's assets.   A least four other offers ranging from $113 million to $200million have been made for PTL, officials said.   Benton has a deadline of Saturday to present a buyer to U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds for approval. The evangelicalempire filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, three months after thescandal over Bakker's sexual liaison with Jessica Hahn.   Bakker said working out deals with banks is especially difficultduring a holiday weekend, but a Midwestern bank, one in Atlanta andanother in Tennessee are interested in handling the funds from theGreek investors he said are are backing his offer.   Bakker declined to identify the investors or the banks.   His lawyer, Jim Toms, said in a telephone interview fromHendersonville, N.C., that some banks are leery of involvementbecause of the controversy surrounding Bakker, but he feels certainone will cooperate before the week ends.   The evangelist said he's readying for the takeover by askingexperts for advice on such things as TV production, hotelmanagement, direct mailings, accounting and musical production.   Bakker, who was defrocked by the Assemblies of God, said thedenomination has ``nothing to do with what we're doing.'' He saidhe is an ordained minister of the Faith Christian Fellowship andthe new PTL will be under that church's guidance.   He said that he knew some viewers have lost faith in him butthat his name recognition has increased dramatically since he leftthe ministry and he expects to more than make up for the loss.   ``Sure we have people who are turning their backs on us and willturn their backs on us,'' he said. ``But we're known by so manymillions more. We're excited about it.''</TEXT></DOC>
