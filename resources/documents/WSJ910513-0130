Philippine President Corazon Aquinosought, and received, U.S. assistance in identifying assetsof her deposed predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos.   The congressional commission investigating Mr. Garcia isalready the center of a political storm in Lima. According topreliminary findings released by Congressional DeputyFernando Olivera, a member of the commission and a politicalopponent of Mr. Garcia's APRA party, the former presidentsalted away millions of dollars with units of BCCI and otherforeign banks during the mid- and late 1980s.   Mr. Garcia's representatives and APRA emphatically denythese allegations. Mr. Garcia's U.S. attorney, JeromeLevinson of the Washington firm Arnold andamp; Porter, said Fridaythat searches of institutions named by Mr. Olivera have sofar failed to turn up any evidence of holdings in the name ofeither Mr. Garcia or his wife. Neither Mr. Garcia nor hiswife had ever held accounts at the banks named by Mr.Olivera, Mr. Levinson said.   U.S. investigators looking into BCCI have discovered thatPeru kept deposits at the controversial Luxembourg-basedinternational institution, which last year pleaded guilty tomoney-laundering in federal court in Tampa, Fla. BCCI remainsunder investigation by district attorneys in New York andWashington, and by the Federal Reserve for possibleviolations involving misrepresentations and false disclosuresto federal regulators.   BCCI handled an increasing amount of business for Peruafter Mr. Garcia, who assumed the presidency in 1985, fellout with his country's foreign bank creditors after stoppingmost interest payments due to them, according to former BCCIofficials, investigators and foreign bankers. From 1985 to1988, BCCI held as much as $450 million of Peru's centralbank reserves, and also provided that country with a $150million line of credit secured by those reserves, accordingto a former BCCI official.   Jorge del Castillo, a Garcia associate who is in the U.S.to defend the former president's reputation, said that Perukept only about $60 million in BCCI accounts, and that thesefunds brought no benefit to Mr. Garcia or his family. Afterelections last year, Mr. Garcia was succeeded as president byAlberto Fujimori.   Mr. Olivera's information sets out a list of seventransfers involving BCCI and other international banks withsums ranging from $500,000 to $20 million. These transfers,according to the information, were made to accounts in avariety of names, including Maria de Garcia; M. Bodereau;Alejandro Bodereau; A.V. Alejandro and Maria Nores; Caribankand Maria Gabriela. Mr. Garcia's wife is Maria Gabriela deNores Bodereau.   Mr. Levinson and other representatives for Mr. Garciadenied that any of the transfers have anything to do with Mr.Garcia or his family. Mr. Garcia's supporters said theallegations are politically motivated. Rafael Garcia, a Miamiprivate investigator hired by the Peruvian commission, saidFriday that he couldn't comment further on the continuinginvestigation. A spokesman for the New York firm of KrollAssociates, the other investigators involved, also declinedto comment on the probe.</TEXT></DOC>
