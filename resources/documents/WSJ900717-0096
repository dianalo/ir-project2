Call a pension fund.   While government officials fret about the threat of acredit crunch, cash-flush pension funds are pumping billionsof dollars into a myriad of new investment pools. Theirgoals: big returns from investing in everything fromsalvaging companies overloaded with debt and buying bankruptsecurities (two of the most popular strategies) to investingin European real estate.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The source of funds for deals used to be insurancecompanies and banks,&quot; says Charles H. Salisbury Jr., amarketing executive for money manager T. Rowe PriceAssociates, Baltimore. &quot;Now the only ones with excess capitalare pension funds.&quot;   So, at a time when Wall Street is shrinking many of itsoperations, organizers of some limited partnership funds forsocalled alternative investments are scoring impressivesuccesses. E.M. Warburg Pincus andamp; Co. recently completedraising a $1.8 billion pool to finance corporate turnaroundsand other investments, with much of the money coming frompension funds, including $100 million from the giantCalifornia Public Employees Retirement System.   Last week, a partnership organized by Chicago investorsSam Zell and David Schulte succeeded in raising $1 billionfrom big investors to rescue troubled companies. Thatincluded $30 million from the Minnesota state public employeepension fund and $10 million from AMR Investment Services,which runs the American Airlines pension fund. Mr. Schultesays that 50% of the money for the new partnership was raisedfrom corporate pension funds and another 24% frompublic-employee pension funds.   Even excluding the new Zell-Chilmark fund, $2 billion hasbeen raised by various turnaround and bankruptcy-investingpartnerships, according to Tremont Partners Inc., New Caanan,Conn., consultants. Tremont has compiled a directory of 50bankruptcy funds, including 10 that have begun shopping formoney since April. &quot;I find that remarkable,&quot; says Mary AnnJohnson, Tremont's president.   Despite the success of some fund-raisers, it is clearly abuyer's market. The cash hoards of the big pension fundsallow them to be picky about the partnerships they will backwith investments, and to demand better financial terms fromsponsors.   National Investment Management Inc., a Californiainvestment firm with five funds under its belt, started toraise money for a new small-company leveraged buy-out fund inJanuary and February by sending out 500 proposal books tofoundations, endowments, pension funds, insurers and banks.During the next three months, it followed up with telephonecalls to each prospect. &quot;Forty said come see us, and fromthat maybe 20 will invest,&quot; said National partner KennethFinn, adding: &quot;We'd be thrilled with $50 million.&quot;   With many highly leveraged companies in trouble, sponsorsare discovering that money for new LBO funds is especiallyhard to find. &quot;Anybody who is raising an LBO fund will tellyou it is tough going,&quot; says Richard Schmeelk, a formerSalomon Brothers banker who has worked in Canada, and now ispushing a new fund for CAI Advisors andamp; Co. to specialize inbuy-outs of Canadian companies.   Targeting geographic or industry niches is becoming astandard marketing tactic for today's LBO fund-raisers.Conseco Capital Partners purchases only insurance companies,for example, and Kansas City-based Reimer andamp; Koger AssociatesInc. is starting to market a fund to buy Oklahoma companies.(It will have the backing of the state government, which willguarantee investors against the loss of half the money theyput into the fund.)   Pension-fund managers are jumping at many of the otherinvestment pitches, however. With assets totaling more than$2.5 trillion, pension funds are brimming with cash lookingfor a home. Previously, they have been big backers ofalternative investments, such as venture capital, oil and gaspartnerships and, in their heyday, LBO funds.   Investments off the beaten path promise diversity andhigher returns than their portfolios of stocks and bonds, themanagers believe. Further, pension funds, especially thosefor state and local government employees, expect to be aroundforever; that allows them to tie up chunks of their assetsfor years, as is often required with alternative investments.   &quot;There is just an enormous amount of money available forenhanced-return investment products,&quot; says Jerome P. Greeneof Benedetto, Gartland andamp; Greene Inc., which sells privatelyplaced securities to pension funds and other big investors.   Just how much money pension funds will pour into thelatest alternative investment pools isn't clear. But even asmall percentage of pension assets means billions of dollarsflowing away from public stock and bond markets and into theunseen world of private investments.   The California Public Employees Retirement System, forexample, recently earmarked 2% of the fund for alternativeinvestments, which investment chief DeWitt Bowman says willprovide a &quot;toe-in-the-water&quot; baptism in the private marketarea. It's a big toe, as the allocation will amount to morethan $1 billion for the $58 billion California fund.   Thomas E. Flanigan, chief investment officer of the $30billion California State Teachers Retirement System, expectspension funds eventually to shift 20% to 25% of their assetsto alternative fields, which he defines as anything outsidepublicly traded stocks and bonds and U.S. real estate.   Mr. Flanigan says that pension funds like his, which isgrowing by $4 billion a year, are becoming the primary sourceof investment funds in the U.S. &quot;We are going to be aligningourselves with multinational corporations and going intopartnerships on an international basis,&quot; he predicts.   Making such deals routine will take years, however. In themeantime, &quot;No one has a concept that is big enough to absorbthe capital that first went into venture funds and thenleveraged buy-out funds,&quot; says Steven P. Galante, managingdirector of Venture Economics Inc., which tracks the ventureand buy-out activity.   Nevertheless, some industry experts worry that pensionofficials are getting caught up in investment fads that couldprove dangerous. &quot;All these limited partnerships that havebeen offered to the pension funds are on the high-risk side,&quot;says Ronald D. Peyton, president of pension consultantsCallan Associates Inc.   But big investors are improving the odds by using theirclout to squeeze more generous terms out of partnershiporganizers. For example, the standard management fee forpartnership organizers, formerly 2% of the assets undermanagement each year, is now more often 1 1/2% or less in newfunds.   &quot;A few years ago we would have made it 2%, but we wantedto remove as many of the barriers as we could&quot; to attractinvestors, says Thomas Hicks, a Dallas-based investmentbanker who has raised $160 million for a new LBO fund andhopes to reach $250 million by the fall.   Organizers in the past also routinely kept 20% of theirpartnerships' profits; now investors are demanding that theyfirst receive a return of about 10% on their investmentsbefore divvying up the rest with the organizer. And thatonce-sacred 20% share for the organizer is under pressure,shrinking to 15% in some cases.   Still another wrinkle is that partnership organizers aregiving investors more leeway to later opt out of deals theymight object to on various grounds.   ---   Randall Smith contributed to this article.   ---            Big Bucks For Investment Partnerships                                                                                                                      (Sampling of 1990 partnerships)                                                                                                        ORGANIZER                           AMOUNT RAISED (TYPE)                              (In billions)                                                                                                        Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co.                    $1.8 (Venture banking)                                                                                                        Zell/Chilmark                             1.0                                                                                                        Thomas H.
