Systems usingoptical techniques and optical components embody the logical solutionsto this need. There are several approaches to the design and integrationof optical devices and components that provide these new techniques.The approach considered in this presentation is based on three rathermodern technologies and concepts: the optical computer; the optical disk;and the optical network. These technologies are examined with regardto their ability to improve system performance, while preserving certainmission partitioning and software. This presentation covers both thenear-term situation, where electronic to optical transitions must beconsidered, and long-term implications, capabilities, and requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
