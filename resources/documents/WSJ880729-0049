Starting today, the Department of Natural Resources plans to issue permits for Tim Dimond of Juneau to collect ice in southeastern Alaska.    Mr. Dimond contacted state officials to ask whether he needed permits. Later he said he wanted the permits as a way to reinforce, for overseas buyers, the legitimacy of his ice-gathering business, said Andy Pekovich, the department's acting land and water manager for southeastern Alaska.    &quot;He initiated this,&quot; Mr. Pekovich said, adding that a permit &quot;is to everyone's advantage&quot; and that anyone else in the ice-collecting business will be expected to get one. The permits are intended to protect wildlife and marine recreation, Mr. Pekovich said.    Calls to Mr. Dimond weren't returned.    Mr. Dimond gathers icebergs with a crane on a 200-foot barge and breaks the ice into chunks for shipment in freezer vans bound for Seattle. AK-Pacific Inc. further breaks down the ice, packs it in one-kilogram (2.2-pound) sacks and ships it to Japan, where a bag sells for about $6.80.    In Japan, glacial ice is enjoyed for its novelty and durability. It lasts about twice as long as a refrigerator ice cube and has no trace of chlorine or other additives, said Jim Harper, vice president of AK-Pacific.    &quot;It's a gourmet type of product that complements the Perrier, mineral water situation,&quot; he said.    The permits limit Mr. Dimond's proximity to campsites used primarily by kayakers and specify ice-collection hours to prevent harvesting when sightseeing ships are in the area. To protect hauling grounds for seals, he cannot collect ice within 10 miles of a glacier. The permits will allow Mr. Dimond to collect 1,000 tons a week.    Southeast Alaska Conservation Council officials oppose the harvests.    &quot;This is a new, incompatible, conflicting use of areas set aside for their natural features, their solitude, their pristine nature,&quot; Bart Koehler, executive director, said. </TEXT></DOC>
