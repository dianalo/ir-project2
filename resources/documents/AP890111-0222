Leaving office with high popularity ratings, Reagan seemeddetermined to prove he was unbowed by the demands and pressures ofan office that has beaten down some of his predecessors.   It was vintage Reagan. He was irrepressibly sunny and optimistic,determined to look on the bright side and to remain silent about thesore spots. If he wished he'd done something differently, he wasn'ttalking about it Wednesday night.   ``My friends, we did it. We weren't just marking time; we made adifference,'' Reagan said in his nationally broadcast address.   ``We meant to change a nation and instead we changed a world.''   The biggest accomplishments, he said, were the economic recoveryand the creation of 19 million new jobs over the last eight years.Moreover, he cited the fact that ``America is respected again in theworld, and looked to for leadership.''   Regrets? Well, yes, but Reagan mentioned only one _ the deficit _and he brushed it aside in just two sentences.   George Bush must be wishing he could dispose of the toweringproblem so easily. Instead, the deficit and the mountain of debtthat nearly tripled during Reagan's term will handcuff Bushfinancially when he takes office on Jan. 20.   The Iran-Contra affair that engulfed Reagan's presidency did notget a mention. Nor did defense-contractor scandals, the Americanhostages in Lebanon, the ethical lapses of some members of hisadministration, the homeless, and the nightmare of the terroristbombing that killed 241 American servicemen in Beirut.   The Contra rebels in Nicaragua, once a subject of consumingpassion of the Reagan White House and the topic of countlessspeeches, were overlooked in the president's upbeat glance at worldaffairs. He once said he wanted the Sandinistas to say ``uncle'';they have not.   He said the superpowers have begun to reduce stockpiles ofnuclear weapons and said that ``hope for even more progress isbright.'' In addition, ``The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone,the Soviets are leaving Afghanistan, the Vietnamese are preparing topull out of Cambodies and an American-mediated accord will soon send50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.''   Basking in the warmth of his meetings with Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev, Reagan said he had ``forged a satisfying new closeness''with Moscow.   He told an incident to make a point about man's yearning forfreedom but, in a way, seemed to reveal a naive understanding aboutthe vast security precautions that are always taken on his behalf.   Reagan recalled that he strolled with Nancy through a shoppingdistrict of Moscow during last year's summit. As Russian citizensrushed to meet him, Reagan said, Soviet KGB agents suddenly pushedand shoved at the crowd _ underscoring, he said, that a communistgovernment views freedom and human rights differently than Americans.   The fact is, American Secret Service agents accompanying Reaganwere shoving at the crowd, too. Secret Service agents do that inAmerica, too, when they're trying to protect a president.   Even after two terms in the White House, Reagan cast himself as aWashington outsider, ``a citizen politician'' who came to thecapital to stop Uncle Sam from imposing more rules and regulationsand to curb government's appetite for taxes.   The onetime Hollywood actor said he didn't earn the nickname of``great communicator'' because of his style or his script, butbecause of the content of his ideas. And he made clear that hisideas were exactly what the country had needed.   Dismissing the objections of his critics, Reagan said, ``The factis, what they called `radical' was really `right;' what they called`dangerous' was just `desperately needed.'''   Once again, Reagan spoke romantically about his vision of a``shining city on a hill'' _ a metaphor for a country living inharmony and peace and prosperity.   ``And how stands the city on this winter night?'' Reagan askedrhetorically. ``More prosperous, more secure and happier than it waseight years ago.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE: Terence Hunt has covered Ronald Reagan since 1980</NOTE><TEXT>   and is the White House correspondent for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
