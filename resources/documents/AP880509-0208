DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the Old Executive Office Building next doorto the White House, James L. Nuzzo scans column after column ofnumbers in a budget book and prepares a memorandum for VicePresident George Bush.   Nuzzo is a neurologist from Boston.   Over at the Agriculture Department, George M. Drysdale makes hisway through the intricacies of farm price supports, soilconservation and consumer services.   Drysdale is a venture capitalist from San Francisco.   In the office of the U.S. trade representative, Karen S.Kellerhouse fields inquiries from mayors and governors about U.S.foreign trade policy.   Ms. Kellerhouse is a financial executive on leave from the PortAuthority of New York and New Jersey.   Nuzzo, Drysdale and Ms. Kellerhouse are among a dozen Americansin their early or middle 30s who are working as White House Fellowsin a program that has survived from Lyndon Johnson's Great Societyto Ronald Reagan's New American Revolution.   Since 1965, more than 300 of them have passed throughWashington, spending 12 months working in federal departments andagencies to learn the ways of government. Some have stayed, andoccupy high posts in the government. Others have gone home.   White House Fellows work at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAgency, the Department of Energy, the Pentagon, the Office ofManagement and Budget, the Justice Department, the Arms Control andDisarmament Agency and in the White House.   Of the current crop, one is a newspaper marketing executive,three are attorneys, one is vice president of a scientific productsfirm. Three are Army majors, one a captain in the Marine Corps.   During their September-through-August stint, for which they werechosen from among about 800 applicants, they receive a salary of upto $55,000 a year. Officials say most of them, successful in theirown careers, absorb a pay cut. Anyone is eligible except federalcivil servants.   Some of the program's graduates have big offices in Washington.Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, who worked as a fellow under then-BudgetDirector Caspar Weinberger in 1971-72, is now President Reagan'snational security adviser. Another alumnus, Michael H. Armacost, isundersecretary of state for political affairs.   Another, David Karnes, says, ``I wouldn't be United Statessenator today if it weren't for the White House Fellows program.''The Nebraska Republican is one of two who have made it to theSenate. Tim Wirth, a fellow in the Department of Health, Educationand Welfare in 1967-68, is a Democratic senator from Colorado.   Henry G. Cisneros of the class of 1971-72 is mayor of SanAntonio; Joe Barton, '81-82, is a representative from Texas; GarryCarruthers, '74-'75, is governor of New Mexico. Tom Johnson,'65-66, is publisher of the Los Angeles Times; James K. Stewart,'81-82, is director of the National Institute of Justice; RobertHaas, '68-69, is president of Levi Strauss and Company; Doris Kearnsmet Lyndon Johnson when she was a fellow, and became his biographer.   Several former fellows are generals or admirals.   It all started in 1957 with John Gardner, then president of theCarnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.   ``I had been doing quite a bit of reading about the foundingfathers and I was struck with the fact that just about every singleone of them had very early opportunity to observe government,''Gardner recalls. ``It was right across the street, so to speak, thegovernment of their colony.'' He also found, he says, ``that theablest kids in the country today never saw anybody governing.''   ``I wrote a memo proposing the idea of a group of White Housefellows and had the idea that it could be financed byfoundations,'' he said. ``The only problem was the bill was veryhigh and there wasn't any foundation interested in it.''   Seven years later, Gardner was having lunch with Eric Goldman, aPrinceton University historian, then an aide to President Johnson.Goldman said Johnson was concerned that too few young people wereinterested in government.   ``Look, I've got a memo,'' says Gardner, who would later becomeJohnson's secretary of health, education and welfare. Goldmanshowed the memo to the president and first lady Lady Bird Johnsonand the program was launched.   Today it has a budget of slightly less than $500,000 a year,supplemented by private funds raised by a foundation set up byformer fellows.   In its early years, the program was limited to applicantsbetween the ages of 24 and 36, but the age requirement wasabandoned in response to an anti-discrimination suit. All of thecurrent fellows, however, would have qualified under the originallimits.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
