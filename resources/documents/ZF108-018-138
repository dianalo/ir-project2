(Chantilly,Va., 800-767-3636) puts together a daily newsletter called Computer Focus anddelivers it to your fax machine overnight.andM;A subscription price of $1,800 a year may seem a bit steep for a newsletter,but Pinpoint &quot;personalizes&quot; each subscriber's newsletter by assembling itemsaccording to subscriber-specified areas of interest.andP;  And as a result ofproprietary techniques, the newsletter comes across with crisp text, andclean gray screens--a distinct improvement over the fuzzy, blotchy appearanceof most fax output.andM;Adobe Systems, developer of the PostScript page-description language, hopesto improve fax quality even more.andP;  The Mountain View, Calif., company isworking on technology that can help a PostScript printer do double duty as afax machine.andP;  Such a priter-fax could send PostScript documents only to asimilarity equipped device.andP;  If it found a regular fax machine, it wouldtransmit documents in standard CCITT Group 3 format at the best quality thatthe fax machine could produce.andM;PostScript faxes would have another advantage, aside from their printquality.andP;  Because PostScript documents are transmitted in ASCII format, whichis more compressed than the Group 3 format, they transmit faster.andP;  If you'rea heavy fax user you'll save on phone costs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
