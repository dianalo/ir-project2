A 26-year-old homosexual man whowas HIV antibody positive underwent gallium imaging for investigationof possible Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Widespread cutaneous focaluptake was seen, which was subsequently shown to be due to mycobacteriumavium-intracellulare (MAI) septicemia. This case demonstrates the importanceof whole body imaging rather than imaging target areas only, the utilityof gallium imaging in aiding the early detection of clinically unsuspecteddisease, and shows a new pattern of gallium uptake in disseminated MAIinfection.</TEXT></DOC>
