The decision, announced following a French cabinet meetingyesterday morning, was a victory for IBM, which had pushedhard to be chosen over Hewlett-Packard Co. as Bull's closesttechnological ally and biggest non-French investor. It was afillip for state-owned Bull, as having two prominent U.S.suitors gave some credence to its claims that it is still aplayer in the world computer industry.</LP><TEXT>   In a preliminary agreement that was wide-ranging butsketchy, IBM agreed to supply Bull with an importantmicrochip technology known as Risc, or reduced instructionset computing, and to manufacture certain computers and partson the French company's behalf. In return, Bull would lendIBM its expertise in developing Risc computers that use morethan one microprocessor &quot;brain,&quot; a specialization it has beendeveloping for some time, and would make some parts for IBM.   The companies said the two-way cooperation had a potentialvalue for both of &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars per year,&quot;a figure they said might be achieved within two years.   The agreement puts Bull squarely in the IBM camp in adeveloping fight over who will dominate the emerging marketfor Risc technology. The other members of that camp includeApple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc., both of whom signed ahigh-profile pact with IBM last year.   As a token of its faith in its new relationship with theFrench company, IBM said it would take an equity stake inBull, as expected. While the exact size of the stake will bedetermined over the next few months by an internal Bullvaluation committee, company officials indicated that IBMwill invest $100 million to $120 million for a stake of 5% to10%.   Earlier yesterday morning, French Prime Minister EdithCresson had told reporters that the IBM stake in Bull wouldbe precisely 5.7%, but Bull's chief executive officer,Francis Lorentz, said in a later news conference in Paristhat Mrs. Cresson was simply making an estimate based oncertain assumptions.   Among other things, the size of IBM's stake depends onwhether the European Community Commission gives the go-aheadto an eight-billion-franc ($1.46 billion) infusion the Frenchgovernment has planned for Bull. In an interview after thenews conference, Mr. Lorentz said he felt IBM's confidence inBull should strengthen the French government's hand againstthe EC commission, which suspects the French of giving Bullan unreasonable and anti-competitive subsidy.   If the capital infusion were to be approved, as Mrs.Cresson appears to have assumed, IBM's stake would be towardthe low end of the 5% to 10% range.   The agreement, the exact terms of which are still undernegotiation, would also allow Bull to sell IBM some portablepersonal computers made by its U.S.-based Zenith Data Systemssubsidiary. While neither IBM nor Bull would say which ZenithData models IBM might sell, IBM senior vice president MichaelArmstrong said in an interview that the models underdiscussion &quot;would fill a hole&quot; in IBM's portable-PC lineup,making it likely that they include computers based on IntelCorp.'s 386SL microchip.   IBM has said it won't develop by itself any computersbased on the 386SL, but has several other portable PCs slatedfor announcement next month. The Bull executive said theZenith Data computers won't be part of that announcement,however, since final agreements still have to be struck.   In a separate development that was also announced afterthe French cabinet meeting yesterday, IBM reached apreliminary technology agreement with SGS-ThomsonMicroelectronics N.V., the Franco-Italian semiconductorcompany that will form part of a giant French nuclear andelectronics conglomerate Mrs. Cresson envisions.   Again the details were sketchy, but according to Mr.Armstrong, IBM has agreed to work with SGS-Thomson on avariety of semiconductor areas in which they both have aninterest. More importantly for SGS-Thomson, he said IBM alsointends &quot;to become an even bigger customer&quot; of the chipcompany's products -- although he didn't give any specificcommitments.   Taken together, the announcements reinforced the Frenchgovernment's determination to stop the decade-long slide ofFrance's information technology industry -- whether byoutright state aid, active industrial policy, or allianceswith global giants such as IBM.   Prime Minister Cresson for months had wanted Bull'stechnological alliance to be with H-P, not IBM. But she wasapparently outmaneuvered by Finance Minister PierreBeregovoy, her main rival in the Socialist-led government,who lined up with Bull management, which all along preferredIBM.   Among other things, IBM was offering to invest more moneythan H-P in Bull, and to help Bull sell its personalcomputers, something H-P didn't want to do. The issue becameso political that it was kicked upstairs to PresidentFrancois Mitterrand, who was persuaded to back IBM.   To save face, Mrs. Cresson told reporters that H-P stillwas thinking of taking a stake in SGS-ThomsonMicroelectronics. But the chief executive of H-P's Frenchunit said in a telephone interview that his company's onlycurrent interest in SGS-Thomson concerns technologicalcooperation. In Palo Alto, Calif., a H-P spokeswoman said thetwo companies &quot;haven't started talking about equity in anyserious way. We're just studying the mutual businessbenefits.&quot;   Bull's new relationship with IBM is somewhat similar toits existing partnership with Japan's NEC Corp., which holdsa 4.7% stake in the French company. While Mr. Lorentzemphasized that Bull's position with NEC hasn't changed, theFrench government has made no secret that it regards the IBMlinkup as insurance that Bull won't become dependent on NEC'stechnology.</TEXT></DOC>
