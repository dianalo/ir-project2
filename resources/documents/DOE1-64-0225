Acquiredprojections are integrals over angular position and may be correlatedinter-projection. This paper shows that angular integration and inter-projectioncorrelation introduce a radially dependent degradation of the spatialresolution and cause the image noise to vary non-linearly with radialposition.</TEXT></DOC>
