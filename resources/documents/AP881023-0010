Two peopledrowned and eight others were feared dead.   At 4:30 p.m. (4:30 a.m. EDT), Ruby was estimated to be about 60miles southeast of the coastal town of Borongan on Samar island,about 360 miles southeast of the capital Manila, the Manila weatherbureau said.   Ruby, centered over the Philippine Sea, had sustained winds of75 miles per hour and was moving northwest at 15 mph towardBorongan, said forecaster Pedro Deogracias.   Deogracias said at that course Ruby will hit Borongan by Mondaymorning.   Col. Triumfo Agustin, Philippine Constabulary regionalcommander, said Ruby caused flash floods in the six villages on theoutskirts of Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental province, about 500miles south of Manila.   Agustin said 1,000 houses along the bloated Agusan River weredestroyed, leaving at least 20,000 people homeless. He added that10 people were reportedly carried by the strong current and feareddead, but only two bodies have so far been recovered.   The typhoon also destroyed the Agusan bridge, Agustin said.   A check with relief agencies in Manila could not immediatelyconfirm the report. Typhoon reports usually take days beforereaching the capital.   ``We have advised the remaining residents along the river toseek higher ground,'' Agustin said.   Manoling Abejuela, Cagayan de Oro's planning engineer, estimateddamage to agricultural crops and houses at $2.4 million dollars.</TEXT></DOC>
