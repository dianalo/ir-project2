Renewing his appeal for assistance from the new leaders inTehran, Bush said, ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for therest of our lives. We've had a good relationship with them in thepast'' before breaking off relations a decade ago.   Iran, accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, isthe major bankroller of Hezbollah, the radical group thought to bean umbrella for various factions of the hostage-holders.   ``I think that if Iran wanted those hostages to come out ofthere, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen _perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood,'' the presidentsaid.   He said that there were limits on possible military action tofree the hostages, that he did not want to see innocent peoplekilled and would have to weigh the risks to U.S. forces that wouldbe involved.   ``But if I could find a way to take those hostages, get them andbring them out, and that required using the military force of theUnited States, make no mistake about it _ I would do it in aninstant,'' the president said.   ``At some point we have to stand up for our interests, even if itmeans military, yet I'm not threatening military action,'' he said.   Bush discussed the hostage situation in a half-hour newsconference on the eve of his departure for a three-week vacation athis seaside compound at Kennebunkport, Maine.   He promised that one day after his Labor Day return toWashington, he would unveil a new anti-drug program that is``balanced, decisive, effective and achievable.''   Bush said the program would require more federal spending but nothigher taxes, adding that the money would be diverted from otherprograms.   While the hostage crisis and, to a lesser extent, drugs,dominated the news conference, he commented on other subjectsranging including economic policy and Panamanian leader ManuelAntonio Noriega. The president:   _ Refused to rule out the possibility of abducting Noriega tostand trial in the United States on drug-trafficking charges. ``Ihave an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' Bush said.   _ Pronounced himself ``very comfortable'' with budget directorRichard Darman's comment that the Federal Reserve was keepinginterest rates too high to permit sustained growth.   However, when asked if he agreed with Darman that the Fed wouldbe responsible for any recession if interest rates don't drop, Bushsidestepped, saying ``I don't recall that part of it and (I'll) takethat under advisement and let you know at a later date.''   _ Said he wished the legal process could proceed ``without a lotof hype'' in the case of Felix Bloch, a State Department officialsuspected of espionage. Bloch has not been charged.   _ Eulogized Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Larkin Smith,R-Miss., who died in separate plane crashes. He said they were``fine individuals (who) represented a deep caring for the poor, thedisadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and many otherareas of our society that need improving.''   The plight of the eight Americans held hostage in Lebanon waspushed to the fore after Israeli commandos seized a Moslem cleric inLebanon, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, on July 28. In response, a groupcalled the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth contended it hadhanged American Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.   Asked if the American hostages were any closer to freedom now asa result of the developments of the past few weeks, Bush said, ``Ican't say that today, but we're going to keep on trying.''   Bush said that with Hashemi Rafsanjani assuming the presidency ofIran, ``we hear different signals coming out of Iran _ some in theold monde and then some that offer more hope.   He said the release of the hostages would send ``a clear and goodsignal'' of Iran's intentions, adding that ``there are many waysthat countries who are estranged can get back together, fromdiplomatic relations or a wide array of other things.''   Asked if the United States might seek the extradition of Obeid,who has been said to have been instrumental in Higgins' abduction,Bush said ``we have no indictment'' against Obeid.   Later, Bush said, ``If the justice system goes forward and thereis an indictment against him, I would be remiss if I didn't try tosee him brought to trial.''   Bush seemed caught off guard momentarily when a questioner askedwhy the United States had not retaliated for Higgins' death.   ``If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, privatesector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostagesout or guard against future hostage taking, I would take suchaction,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
