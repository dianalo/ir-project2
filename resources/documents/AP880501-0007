VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson and George Bush found themselves in an unlikelypolitical alliance Saturday as both attacked Democraticpresidential front-runner Michael Dukakis, with Jackson saying he'stoo conservative and Bush saying he's not tough enough.   Dukakis, who avoided any mention of his rivals during a day ofcampaigning in Ohio and Indiana, responded to Bush's charges bysuggesting that ``maybe it's time for him to stop criticizingothers.''   In answer to Jackson's criticisms, the Massachusetts governorcited his state's economic record as an example of his strongleadership ability.   In another development, The Washington Post reported in itsSunday editions that testimony and documents from a private lawsuitportray top aides to Bush as being more actively involved inCentral American counterinsurgency planning from 1983 to 1986 thanpreviously disclosed.   The information, however, does not contradict assertions bysenior advisers Donald P. Gregg and Col. Samuel J. Watson III thatthey were unaware until August 1986 of the plan to resupply theNicaraguan rebels during a ban on U.S. aid, the newspaper said.   Dukakis spent the day pleading with supporters in both states toavoid the overconfidence that may come from his wide lead overJackson for the Democratic presidential nomination.   ``I want to ask you once again to do everything you can, onthose phone banks, in your neighborhoods, with your friends andco-workers, to make sure the people are taking this primaryseriously, that they know it is important,'' Dukakis said inCincinnati.   Dukakis is heavily favored to win Tuesday's primaries in Ohioand Indiana and has built up a 424-delegate lead over Jackson asthe two campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination.   Dukakis leads Jackson by a ratio of more than 2{-1 and hasincreased his lead over Jackson in the last month, according to apoll published in Sunday's editions of The Columbus Dispatch.   The poll showed Dukakis was the favorite among 62 percent of the1,974 registered Democrats who responded to the statewide poll,while Jackson was the choice of 24 percent.   The newspaper conducted its poll by mail Monday throughThursday. It has an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 3percent on each result.   The April poll compared with a poll the newspaper conducted inMarch that showed Dukakis leading Jackson 50 percent to 23 percent.   Dukakis was the choice of 62 percent of the Democrats likely tovote in Ohio's primary, according to a statewide poll conducted bythe University of Akron.   The poll, paid for by the Akron Beacon Journal and televisionstations WCMH in Columbus and WKYC in Cleveland, found that Jacksonhad the support of 22 percent.   The telephone survey was based on telephone interviews with 926registered Ohio voters between April 20 and Saturday. It had amargin of error of 3.5 percentage points.   While optimistic of his prospects in Ohio and Indiana, Dukakiswarned his supporters that overconfidence contributed to his 1978defeat when he ran for re-election as governor of Massachusetts.   ``It was the most painful experience of my life,'' Dukakis toldworkers in Cleveland.   Bush, who also was campaigning in Ohio even though he has amathematical lock on the Republican presidential nomination, calledfor the death penalty for ``drug kingpins'' and said that bothJackson and Dukakis lack his toughness on this issue.   Both Dukakis and Jackson oppose capital punishment.   ``We've appointed tougher judges. We are getting moreconvictions and longer sentences. But where are the Democrats onmandatory sentencing, on tougher penalties for those who poison ourkids with drugs? I favor the death penalty for drug kingpins, thoseinvolved in drug-related killings,'' he said.   ``If Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are serious about this,let's see where they stand on throwing the book at those who arepoisoning the lives of the young people.''   Jackson criticized Dukakis for not going far enough incommitting himself to spend money on such issues as child care,southern Africa, education, and drugs.   ``We need a massive commitment to invest in people, reinvest inAmerica and end Reaganomics,'' Jackson said at a rally in Columbus.   He criticized Dukakis for offering $250 million in new educationspending saying, ``You cannot educate every child in America to goto college on only $250 million.''   However, Jackson stopped short of saying that Dukakis would tryto pull Democrats toward Republican policies.   ``I would not put him in that category,'' he said. ``There aresome in the Democratic Party who would pull our party towardconservatism.''   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk said Jackson's charges thatDukakis doesn't offer an alternative to Republicans didn't crossthe line into negative campaigning.   ``In any primary, in any contest, you have to have a healthyclash of ideas,'' said Kirk, who attended a party fund-raiser inIndianapolis. ``... But that's a long way from maligning orsmearing a candidate or having inaccuracies about the issues or therecord.''   Later, at a rally on the University of Dayton campus, Jacksonsuggested that Dukakis was a managerial candidate, while he is aleader. The preacher-turn-politician said attainment of peace inthe world and altering President Reagan's economic policy requiresleadership, not management.   ``To end Reaganomics, we need a leader. We need to change thecourse,'' Jackson told the cheering, racially mixed crowd at theOhio school. ``To find peace in the Middle East, we must haveleadership. We cannot manage apartheid, we must end apartheid.''   Dukakis, during a campaign stop in Indianapolis, defendedhimself against Jackson's criticisms, saying, ``When it comes toleadership, I'm very proud of the fact that I'm governor of a statewhich is generally viewed to be a state that's way out front ... Mykind of leadership is as a doer and not a talker.''   In response to Bush's charges, Dukakis said: ``I think maybeit's time for him to stop criticizing others and to begin toaddress some fundamental issues that face this country.''   Bush also renewed his counterattack on the issue of AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III, who is the subject of a number ofinvestigations by an independent counsel. Democrats have citedMeese as evidence of a ``sleaze factor'' in the Reaganadministration that will be an issue in the fall campaign.   ``I've heard Dukakis and Jackson talk about sleaze. What arethey talking about? Who are they talking about?'' said Bush. ``Arethey convicting someone before the system works?''   Bush warned that if the Democrats ``want to go down the lowroad, we'll meet them.''</TEXT></DOC>
