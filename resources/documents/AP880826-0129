But the FBI's assistant director labels the allegations``outrageous and repugnant.''   The flurry of charges and counter-charges in court Thursdaypunctuated the end of the nine-day trial before U.S. District JudgeLucius Bunton, who said he hopes to render a decision by Oct. 1.Almost 100 witnesses testified.   The 311 Hispanic agents joined in the class-action suit contendthe FBI discriminates in the promotion, discipline and assignmentof Hispanics. They seek unspecified damages and changes in FBIpolicies.   About 400 _ or 4.3 percent _ of the FBI's 9,400 agents areHispanic, compared to about 8 percent of the general population.   The plaintiffs' attorneys, Hugo Rodriguez and Antonio Silva,complained Tuesday and Thursday that the bureau has kept watch onthem and possibly begun an investigation to discredit them.   ``This is the FBI,'' said Rodriguez, who resigned from the FBIlast year after 18 years. ``You've heard witness after witnessstate that the first rule of the FBI is, `Don't embarrass thebureau.' That's what this case is doing. It's bringing out thedirty laundry of the FBI.''   About 40 agents testified that the the bureau transfers Hispanicagents more often to undesirable locations, hands them assignmentsthat are less glamorous or more dangerous, promotes them slower andgives them less recognition for their successes.   Witnesses called by the FBI denied the accusations.   Rodriguez and Silva were notified Thursday that the FBI wasconcerned about a possible security breach in connection with thedisappearance of an affidavit from Rodriguez' briefcase last month.Someone mailed the affidavit to FBI headquarters.   Rodriguez and Silva implied the FBI stole the document July 29so it could start an embarrassing investigation.   Silva told Bunton: ``The government is attempting to put us injail, to ruin our legal careers, for representing these men andwomen of the FBI.''   But Milt Ahlerich, FBI assistant director for Congressional andpublic affairs, said the charge was false and denied aninvestigation resulted from the affidavit's disappearance.   ``They're the ones making a veiled allegation of a documentbeing taken from them,'' he said. ``The idea that the FBI wouldtamper with attorneys' papers is outrageous and repugnant to theFBI's mission.''   On Tuesday, FBI attorney Lainie Simion tried to introduce intoevidence a document concerning a closed investigation into whetherRodriguez and Silva were selling arms to the Nicaraguan Contrarebels.   Bunton did not allow the document into evidence. No chargesresulted from the investigation, which Rodriguez dismissed as agroundless intimidation tactic that he said was started after hereesigned from the FBI.   An El Paso police officer lent credence to the surveillancecharges when he testified Thursday that he saw a man hiding in thepolice garage last April, taking photos through a telephoto lens ofRodriguez and Silva leaving the courthouse with the lead plaintiff,Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez.   The officer reported the incident to the FBI. A briefinvestigation revealed nothing, testified Richard Schwein, specialagent in charge of the El Paso FBI office.   Perez, the No. 2 agent in El Paso, filed the suit in January1987.</TEXT></DOC>
