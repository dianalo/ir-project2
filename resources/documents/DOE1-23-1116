<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-1116 </DOCNO><TEXT>The fundamental question whether the normal-zone growth in a quenchingmain-coil of a transformer of the type which has been discussed hereis due to thermal propagation or to magnetic quenchback, has to be answeredin favour of the former mechanism. The typical effect of quenchback,which is the simultaneous development of normal spots in more sectionsof the coil than only the heated one, has not been observed. Only onesection, that was identified in another experiment as the weakest onein the coil, developed a resistive voltage as a result of the high currentand field derivative during quenching. There was however a clearly visibletime lag between the voltage development across the heated section (no.4) and this weakest one (no. 8). The thermal propagation model leadingto (1) does not adequately calculate the propagation velocity in a compositewith a high-resistivity matrix. A possible explanation for this is thatthe assumption I/sub s/ andless;andless; I/sub c/,in which I/sub c/ is the criticalcurrent of the secondary conductor, is not fulfilled. In other words,in thermal propagation models for such a conductor a critical currentshould be substituted that is not the DC value.</TEXT></DOC>
