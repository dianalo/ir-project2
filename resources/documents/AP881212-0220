Trainers and relatives of the diminutive jockeys, 5 to 14 yearsold, roar down the side of the track in four-wheel-drive pickuptrucks and Toyotas, screaming instructions, yelling their riders onin a cacophony of noise.   Halfway down the two-mile, arrow-straight track 25 miles west ofthe capital Muscat, senior government officials and sheiks dressedin pristine white robes lounge in an open-sided tent sippingcardoman-scented Arabic coffee and iced soft drinks served on silverplatters as the camels gallop past.   There is no betting. It's forbidden in Islamic Oman. But there isprestige for the owners of winning camels, specially bred as racingsteeds.   Camel racing, once little more than a desert pastime, has becomea big sport in Oman and the other Arab states on the Persian Gulf,patronized by the region's billionaire princes and sheiks. Racingcamels sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.   An Omani breeder, Saeed Malki, earlier this year sold athroughbred female racer to a sheik in the neighboring United ArabEmirates for a record $155,000.   Wealthy Arabs are spending millions of dollars in breeding racingcamels and in prize money during the November-April season, when thesearing desert temperatures cool to a tolerable 95 degrees.   Prizes can be as high as $250,000 in some of the bigger meets,particularly in the United Arab Emirates. In one race in SaudiArabia recently, some 600 camels took part.   The sport has given camels a new lease of life. With thehelter-skelter modernization brought by the Persian Gulf's oilriches, camels have largely become obselete as beasts of burden ortransportation in a region where just about everyone drives a car orpickup.   Once camels were also the Bedouin nomads' source of milk, hidesand often food. But even this has disappeared as many desertdwellers moved to the towns. Some sheiks provide subsidies for camelbreeders.   Oman's National Day races don't come near matching the KentuckyDerby.   The camels and their trainers, handlers and jockeys, who aredressed in ragged robes or colored track suits, squat in the sand atone end of the track, waiting their turn to race, hurlinggood-natured insults at each other.   A white-robed steward named Ahmad, curved Omani dagger in hisornate silver belt, tried to maintain order while keeping in touchwith the finish line through a squalking walkie-talkie.   The runners are selected. The handlers strap in the boy jockeysbehind the camels' humps with cloth straps and velcro pads so theywon't be hurled off.   The starter's gun cracks and a dozen camels stampede from thestarting line.   The handlers have to be agile to get out the way of the forest ofhooves. One middle-aged man was a little too slow and was trampled.Stunned and shaken, but apparently with no broken bones, he wascarried to an ambulance.   Sometimes, the jockeys do fall off. But they hit the ground witha roll that a paratrooper would be proud of. There are bumps andbruises, but no serious injuries.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Dec. 19</NOTE></DOC>
