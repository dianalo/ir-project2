The Commerce Department said that the 2.3 percent drop in thetrade deficit during the second quarter marked the secondconsecutive quarterly decline. The deficit had fallen an evensharper 11.4 percent in the first three months of the year to $28.38billion.   The April-June improvement came from a 3.4 percent increase inexports, which climbed to an all-time high of $90.87 billion. Thismore than offset a 2 percent rise in imports, which also set arecord at $118.58 billion.   Many analysts are concerned that the rapid growth in exports,which provided much of the momentum for overall economic activitylast year, has already begun to slow under the impact of a rise inthe value of the dollar.   A stronger dollar makes American goods less competitive onoverseas markets while making imports cheaper in the United States.   Rising demand for imported oil is also expected to make thedeficit worsen in the second half of the year. While non-oil importsactually fell in the second quarter, oil imports shot up by 23.8percent.   ``This is the end of the good news on trade,'' said MichaelEvans, head of a Washington forecasting firm. He and other analystspredicted the deficit would widen slightly in coming months.   ``With the dollar having risen so much in the last 18 months,export growth has slowed while import growth remains fairlystrong,'' said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill.   For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit isrunning at an annual rate of $112.2 billion, down almost 12 percentfrom the 1988 deficit of $127.2 billion.   Evans said he expected the deficit would show only a marginalimprovement for the whole year and he predicted the trade balancewould actually begin to rise again in 1990 as the dollar's increaseeats further into export growth.   Monday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balanceof payment basis confirmed an improvement already noted in theCommerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports.   The totals from the two reports vary slightly because the balanceof payments report exludes military sales by the U.S. government andmakes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures.   The $27.7 billion deficit in the April-June quarter was thelowest quarterly imbalance since a $25.7 billion deficit in thefirst three months of 1985.   The lower-than-expected trade deficit for the second quarter,along with stronger consumer spending, should prompt an upwardrevision in the estimate of overall economic growth when it isreleased by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, many analysts said.   In advance of the report, many economists were predicting thegross national product would be revised from a lackluster 1.7percent annual rate in the second quarter to a more respectable 2.7percent rate, further easing fears that the economy is in danger oftoppling into a recession this year.   The second quarter trade improvement was propelled by a 3.9percent rise in non-farm exports, which climbed to a record $80.1billion. This gain reflected widespread increases in a variety ofmerchandise categories. Exports of airplanes jumped 12 percent whilecomputer sales were up 5 percent and consumer exports rose 7.3percent.   The increase in imports occurred because of the $2.6 billion risein petroleum imports, which climbed to $13.4 billion, reflectingboth higher prices and an increase in volume. Non-oil imports edgeddown 0.3 percent to $105.2 billion.   The price per barrel of oil rose to $18.46, up 18.8 percent fromthe first quarter, while the volume climbed to 7.97 million barrelsa day, up 4.1 percent from the previous quarter.   Evans said with domestic production declining and energy demandsgrowing, America's foreign oil bill is headed even higher. He notedthat oil imports in July, which were not reflected in this report,supplied more than 50 percent of domestic needs, the first time thathas occurred in 12 years.   Sales of U.S. farm products slipped a tiny 0.3 percent to $10.7billion with part of the decline reflected in a $500 million drop inwheat sales to the Soviet Union. Soybean sales fell by $200 mllion,primarily because of a cutback in shipments to Western Europe, whiletobacco exports were down $200 million because of a drop inshipments to Japan.   The average price of soybeans fell 4 percent while cotton priceswere down 3 percent and corn prices declined 2 percent. Wheat priceswere up 2 percent on average.   As usual, the biggest deficit was run up with Japan, an imbalanceof $12.2 billion, a full 44 percent of the total deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
