Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BA AMR GEAEROSPACE (ARO)AIRLINES (AIR) </IN><TEXT>   American Airlines' decision to split its order for $2.5 billion worth of aircraft between Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie -- and to lease rather than buy the planes -- could usher in a new era of competition between U.S. aircraft makers and their chief European rival.    &quot;It's ominous for the American companies,&quot; Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said. The apparently generous leasing terms governing American's order yesterday of 15 Boeing 767-300 jetliners, he said, couldn't be done by a U.S. company &quot;more than once or twice without jeopardizing its existence.&quot;    For Airbus, a government-supported consortium of French, West German, British and Spanish companies, the risk is outweighed by its giant step in increasing its share of the U.S. market. By placing 25 of its A300-600 planes with one of the biggest carriers in the U.S., Airbus has significantly widened its U.S. business base. American currently flies only planes built by Seattle-based Boeing and St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.    As expected, the same General Electric Co. engine model will power all 40 of the twin-engine planes American ordered. GE, which valued the CF6-80C2 engines at $650 million, said it was its largest single commercial jet order ever. Neither GE nor American would say, however, who would own the engines or who would bear risk if American terminated its leases.    A spokesman for American Airlines, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp., described the Boeing and Airbus orders only as &quot;rent-a-plane&quot; leases that can be terminated on relatively short notice. However, the company told analysts in New York that the agreements call for a 20-year lease with a four-year renewal option and provide for a fixed-price purchase option, according to one of the analysts. American told the analysts that the leases could be canceled with &quot;minimal&quot; penalties after 30 days' notice during the first 10 years of the 20-year agreement.    The carrier said it benefits from those terms by building its fleet &quot;without adding to the company's debt structure.&quot;    But the arrangements also apparently leave Boeing and Airbus with the risk that they will have to take back unwanted aircraft in the event of a repeat of the economic circumstances of the late 1970s. Then, U.S. airlines were hobbled by excess fleet capacity when their ordering plans turned out to be too ambitious.    Boeing declined to comment about the leasing terms with American, although a spokesman for its Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. unit noted that Boeing often has said it prefers selling aircraft.    For both Boeing and Airbus, the American Airlines orders are so-called launch orders -- the first for new models that their manufacturers are marketing world-wide.    The Boeing plane is a 215-seat &quot;extended range&quot; version of the wide-bodied 767 called the 767-300ER, capable of flying 6,600 miles. Boeing rolled out the first 767-300ER late last year, without a firm order in hand, and is listing its price at between $66 million and $72 million each. The company valued its portion of the American order at &quot;more than $1 billion.&quot;    The Airbus A300-600R model seats 267 and flies 4,300 miles. A company spokesman said the aircraft sell for about $60 million each, although it didn't place a total value on the planes American ordered.    American sought to emphasize that it plans different uses for the two planes. The Boeing jetliners are intended primarily for transatlantic use, while the Airbuses will be assigned to Caribbean routes built around a new hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico.    But the Airbus and Boeing planes are similar enough, despite the difference in range, that the American Airlines decision to order both has raised eyebrows among aerospace analysts. Generally, &quot;fleet simplification&quot; is an airline industry byword, and airlines try to limit the number of aircraft types in their fleets to reduce costs for maintenance, spare parts and crew training.    &quot;These planes basically are competitive; they overlap about 75%,&quot; Mr. Nisbet of Prudential-Bache said. He said he believes the split order reflects &quot;an extra shot of political competition&quot; between Airbus and U.S. aircraft makers.    &quot;It's more than a coincidence that American Air is initiating service to Paris and Frankfurt&quot; at the same time it orders planes from a manufacturer that has ties to the governments involved, Mr. Nisbet said.    Airline industry analysts suggested that other large carriers, including Continental, United and Delta, may take a hint from American and press for manufacturer-leasing arrangements in future orders for wide-bodied jets.    American Airlines reached a similar lease arrangement with McDonnell Douglas in 1982 in ordering 150-passenger MD-80 jets. And while seen as extremely risky for McDonnell at the time, that transaction paid off handsomely for the manufacturer when American soon began buying the 89 leased airliners outright. McDonnell since has had an active worldwide MD-80 business.    David J. Smith, an aerospace analyst with Baltimore-based Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, said Boeing's lease arrangement with American eventually could turn out as well for that manufacturer as the 1982 transaction was for McDonnell.    Boeing probably wasn't happy with having to lease the 767s to American, he said. But the world's airlines &quot;are at the front end of a buying cycle for wide-bodied planes,&quot; Mr. Smith added. And even if American decided to return the Boeing 767-300s, &quot;there are customers for this particular plane all over the place.&quot;    Mr. Smith said he believes Airbus, in contrast, is continuing to sacrifice profitability in its attempt to increase U.S. market share. The analyst said he doesn't think the new model A300 has the wide market appeal that the new 767 has, and added, &quot;I think Airbus all but gave American the airplanes.&quot;    Separately, All Nippon Airlines signed a contract equivalent to $1.04 billion to buy 20 A320-200 jets from Airbus, an official of the Japanese airline said. Airbus said in December that All Nippon had ordered 10 of the twin-jet airliners and had taken options on another 10. All Nippon, which became the first Japanese carrier to order A320s, will use the planes to replace Boeing 737-200s.    If there are risks for the companies providing American with aircraft, they apparently extend as well to General Electric.    A spokesman for Pratt andamp; Whitney, the United Technologies Corp. unit that is GE's biggest engine-making competitor, said his company didn't bid on the American order because &quot;we felt it was too risky.&quot;    While GE wouldn't provide details of its part of the agreement, some analysts said they understood its aircraft-engine unit is accounting for the engine transaction as a sale.    Nicholas Heymann, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., speculated that GE may set up a third-party financing company through its General Electric Credit Corp. unit, which would assume the risk of cancellations by American. The financing company, which would own the engines and lease them to American, might then sell partnerships to transfer the risk to outside investors, Mr. Heymann suggested.    ---   Michael Totty and Janet Guyon contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
