HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FIN F CCITENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's largest thrift, said its institutional deposits declined nearly 20% in the third quarter, apparently because of reports of the thrift's deepening problems.    The disclosure of the deposit outflow came in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Financial Corp. of America, the Irvine, Calif.-based parent of the troubled thrift.    In the filing, Financial Corp. also disclosed that because of its depressed stock price, it rescinded a previously reported agreement to settle various shareholder lawsuits by issuing new shares valued at $32 million. Financial Corp. said it is trying to renegotiate the settlement.    In addition, Financial Corp. said it cut back its interest-rate hedge positions last month, sharply increasing its exposure to potential losses if rates begin to rise again. The company also provided some new details of a restructuring plan it has proposed to federal regulators. However, the plan faces major obstacles and industry executives and analysts believe it is unlikely to be adopted in its present form. Financial Corp. itself said the plan could &quot;change materially&quot; during talks with the regulators.    Institutional deposits at American Savings, which are mostly uninsured, decreased by $477 million during the third quarter to about $2 billion, Financial Corp. said. &quot;This decrease is mainly due to institutional deposits reacting to recent publicity regarding the company, to the company's pricing strategy and efforts to effectively manage the cost of funds,&quot; Financial Corp. said.    The majority of American Savings' $16.87 billion of deposits are from retail customers and are covered by federal deposit insurance. Retail deposits increased by $62 million in the quarter, Financial Corp. said. The figure for the outflow of institutional deposits also includes $70 million of deposits placed by securities brokers, which generally are under $100,000 and therefore are insured.    However, a continued outflow of institutional deposits could make it more difficult for Financial Corp. to meet federal liquidity requirements, particularly if interest rates rise. Rising rates would mean that Financial Corp. would have to put up more collateral, such as mortgage-backed securities, for its $12.83 billion of borrowings from Wall Street firms and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.    The decrease in institutional deposits apparently reflects growing uncertainty over how Financial Corp.'s problems, which stem from a massive portfolio of bad real estate loans, will be resolved. Ford Motor Co. and Citicorp have expressed interest in acquiring all or part of American Savings, but both companies would demand assistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    Financial Corp. said it rescinded the settlement of various shareholder lawsuits under a provision allowing the company to take such action if its common stock price was below $6.50 when all claims were processed. Claims totaling more than $400 million from holders who bought Financial Corp. shares between 1980 and 1985 were finally processed as of Nov. 4, when the company's stock closed at $1.75 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Financial Corp. common shares have risen since then to close at $2.50 a share, down 32.5 cents yesterday in Big Board trading. But even at that price, issuing $32 million of new shares in the settlement would dilute the interests of current shareholders by about 25%.    Financial Corp. said it previously set up a reserve of $35 million to cover the settlement, but said it can't &quot;reasonably quantify&quot; how much of a reserve would be required if it can't renegotiate the settlement.    Also in the SEC filing, Financial Corp. said the reduction in its interest-rate hedge positions during October caused its one-year negative gap, an industry measure of interest-rate risk, to increase to 36.4% at Oct. 31 from 25.2% at Sept. 30. The figure measures the difference between assets and liabilities that change rates within one year, and expresses that figure as a percentage of total assets.    Financial Corp. also provided its first written, public description of a restructuring plan that it presented to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board earlier this year.    Under the plan, American Savings would be split into four separate thrifts. One thrift, which would contain most of Financial Corp.'s tax credits and about $1 billion in assets, would be sold to raise capital for the surviving American Savings, which would have $20 billion of assets. The two other units, which would remain part of Financial Corp., would contain, respectively, $14 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $5 billion of troubled loans and real estate, Financial Corp. said.    Financial Corp. said FSLIC assistance would be required to guarantee loans from the surviving American Savings unit to the other two thrifts within Financial Corp. and to cover any operating losses of the other two units. </TEXT></DOC>
