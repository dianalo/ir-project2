<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0762 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new method of calculating the composition of mixed micelle and mixedmonolayer in equilibrium with monomer of known composition is proposed.The Gibbs-Duhem equation and the pseudo-phase separation model were usedin the proposed method. The method needs only CMC data and the monomerconcentrations at the standard state surface tension as a function ofmonomer composition, but is limited to binary surfactant systems. Theproposed methodology is applied to cationic/cationic, cationic/nonionic,and anionic/nonionic surfactant pairs. 156 refs., 68 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
