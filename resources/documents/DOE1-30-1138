This processing technique involves two thermal-treatmentsteps, nitridation and sintering. Therefore, this technique results ina higher number of parameters, compared with the sintering of Si/sub3/N/sub 4/-powder compacts. In this paper the influence of Si-powdercharacteristics (especially the particle size distribution) the typeand amount of additives as well as the processing parameters sinteringtime and temperature on the densification behaviour and on the resultingproperties of the post-sintered reaction bonded Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ (SRBSN),such as density and flexural strength, is discussed. Especially, formaterials with low additive content a distinct correlation between thecharacteristics of the Si-starting powder and the properties of SRBSNcould be found.</TEXT></DOC>
