Michael, 14, said he and friend Travell Brown, 15, designed thepainting and sneaked out to the Metrolina Courier Inc. buildingearly Monday. Michael spent two hours squirting the blue spraypaint. The next night he did the same thing.   Michael covered 40 feet of a concrete-block wall with words,buildings, clouds, an angry face and lots of star bursts. ``I callit bubble letters,'' he said. ``I got the idea from the letters onthe ice machine at the store.''   Company President Joseph Greene loved it. In Thursday'sCharlotte Observer, he and partner Harrill Jones offered to pay theartist to design and paint a mural. Michael read the article andcalled Greene on Friday.   Michael and Travell agreed to draw up plans for the wall overthe weekend. They didn't discuss with Greene how much the job wasworth.   But Michael's grandmother, Pearl Brown, said Friday she wasn'thappy and punished Michael by giving him a dusk curfew.   ``I scolded him and told him he knows better than that,'' shesaid.   ``Wrong is wrong,'' she said.</TEXT><DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Army wants Anne M. Verret to put her``talent and valuable training'' back to work with the New JerseyNational Guard. It even promises that she can work with ``theworld's most sophisticated and expensive military equipment.''   There's one problem, though. Anne Verret is a 59-year-oldgrandmother and homemaker who has never been in the armed forcesand has never lived in New Jersey.   Mrs. Verret received the letter and accompanying literatureThursday from the Department of the Army and the Air Force inTrenton, N.J. Included was a form letter from New Jersey Gov.Thomas H. Kean congratulating Mrs. Verret on her military serviceand asking her to join the state unit.   Mrs. Verret said Friday her husband, who was in the Marines for20 years, ``thinks it's a scream.'' But she said she found itannoying.   Carl Golden, a spokesman for Kean, said the National Guard hadasked the governor, a former guard member, to head the guard'srecent recruitment drive.   ``Whenever you have a mailing of this size, there's bound to beletters that go to people who don't apply to the situation,''Golden said.   Sgt. 1st Class John K. O'Zemko, director of marketing for theNew Jersey Army National Guard, said Friday the guard sent out300,000 letters, including 70,000 in neighboring Pennsylvania, withthe help of a mailing list provided by a New York company.   Mrs. Verret was not the only one who shouldn't have received theletter. O'Zemko said he received calls from several people who saidthe letter missed its mark.</TEXT></DOC>
