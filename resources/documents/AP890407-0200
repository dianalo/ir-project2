Perhaps an even greater contrast can be found in Kennard's ownlife.   ``When I was living in a Quonset hut in the jungles of NewGuinea, I never thought I would make it to America, let aloneachieve what I have,'' the 47-year-old jurist told reporters afterher unanimous confirmation by the state's Commission on JudicialAppointments.   Kennard is an immigrant who arrived alone in Los Angeles at 20with few resources. She's a straight-A student who went throughcollege, graduate school and law school in six years while workingat least 20 hours a week, a well-liked lawyer and judge who spentonly a year at each court level before reaching the top.   As an infant, she was held in a Japanese internment camp in hernative Indonesia. Later, she and her mother lived in poverty in asegregated village in New Guinea. She lost a leg to alife-threatening infection at 16 in the Netherlands.   A colleague at her last job, Appeals Court Justice ArmandArabian, described her to the commission as ``this wondrous waif ofdestiny.'' Asked if she had any weaknesses, he said, ``None knownto mortals.''   Described by commentators as moderate to conservative, Kennarddoes not alter the balance on the court, controlled 5-2 byappointees of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. The retiringjustice she succeeded, John Arguelles, was the most moderate ofDeukmejian's appointees.   But she adds some diversity to a court that, in its 140 years,has never had a justice of Asian descent and has had only one otherwoman, who arrived in very different circumstances.   Bird, named chief justice of a then-liberal court by DemocraticGov. Jerry Brown in 1977, was a figure of controversy from thestart.   A former public defender and Brown cabinet member with nojudicial experience, she came to the court determined to break upthe ``old-boy network'' that had long controlled administration andhiring.   She was met with resentment that she aggravated with a bluntmanner.   The internal antagonisms eased somewhat over the years, butBird's external opposition grew. After narrowly surviving herinitial 1977 confirmation vote and her first statewide election in1978, she was swept out of office in a 1986 campaign that focusedon the court's frequent reversals of death sentences.   Two other liberals also were voted out, clearing the way forDeukmejian to appoint a conservative majority to the court for thefirst time in 30 years.   The governor's first five appointees, all men, have swung thecourt to the right, affirming death sentences about 70 percent ofthe time and ruling in favor of insurers and employers in majorcases.   Kennard, after four years as a deputy attorney general and sixas a research lawyer for an appeals court, has spent only threeyears on the bench, one each at the municipal, superior andappellate courts. Her written record amounts to 11 precedentialopinions, none in high-profile cases.   But she got glowing testimonials from judicial colleagues andlawyers who have appeared before her, and not one unfavorableletter among 22 written to the commission. The State Bar assessedher as ``well-qualified,'' its second-highest rating, apparentlybecause of her relative inexperience.   In a brief session with reporters, Kennard described herself as``sensitive to women's issues'' without elaborating.</TEXT></DOC>
