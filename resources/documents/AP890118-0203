The influx swelled to about 100,000 people the Nicaraguan exilecommunity centered in a county that already was one-third Cuban.   Some black community leaders have cited resentment over thewelcome given the Nicaraguans and fears the new immigrants willcrowd blacks out of jobs as fueling ethnic tensions in Miami. Therioting that broke out this week began after the fatal shooting of ayoung black man by a Hispanic police officer.   ``The riots are terrible, a disaster,'' said Quintero, who withhis wife and three children have been taken in by Nicaraguan friendsin Sweetwater, the nearby city dubbed Little Managua. ``I don'tunderstand it. I heard it might have something to do with us. Iheard the blacks don't like us too much.''   ``This doesn't have anything to do with us. We didn't come hereto cause problems. We came here to work and to live in freedom,''said Julio Aquilar, a youth looking over a Spanish-languagenewspaper report on the rioting.   He was outside Bobby Maduro Stadium, a makeshift city shelter forabout 200 Nicaraguans and about 180 other Miami homeless people.   The city is renovating a replacement shelter so the stadium canbe vacated by next week and readied for its spring tenants, theBaltimore Orioles baseball team. Meanwhile, the Roman CatholicArchdiocese put up 150 immigrants at its Family Activities Center onSunday.   Gerard Jean-Juste, a Catholic priest, and other Haitian communityleaders and some American black leaders said Haitians, who areblack, don't receive such help. They said the United States has aracist immigration policy of intercepting Haitians at sea andsending them back home while allowing white Hispanics to enter fromCentral America and apply for political asylum.   Cuban-born Mayor Xavier Suarez has blamed the rioting on badpolice relations with the black community and other long-termproblems. But he also said Wednesday it was time for U.S.immigration policy to remove distinctions that give the appearanceof discrimination.   The Nicaraguan arrivals hit a peak of 200 a day after a federaljudge in Texas ruled two weeks ago that U.S. immigration authoritiescouldn't force them to stay near the border while their politicalasylum requests were being considered.   Virginia Kice, Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswomanin Harlingen, Texas, said that since Jan. 9, authorities hadreceived 2,733 political asylum applications from Central Americans.Of those, 44 percent were Nicaraguans, she said.   ``Thirty-four percent (of the Central Americans) indicated theywere traveling on to Miami, which is fewer than we expected from ourprevious experience,'' Ms. Kice said. She said it was too early tospeculate on why the numbers were lower than the 50 percentpredicted. New York and Los Angeles, at 13 percent each, were thenext-favorite destinations, she said.   Many of the Nicaraguans are without work permits, which arehanded out slowly by INS after case-by-case review. But in additionto city aid, Spanish-language radio and television drives haveraised about $70,000, and private donors have kept them suppliedwith clothing and food.   ``A lot of them have gained weight here. Some of them got sickbecause they ate too much,'' said Pablo Canton, assistant citydirector of community development.   ``Most of the Cubans can identify with this group; that's whythey've been so generous,'' said Canton, who came with his familyfrom Cuba 27 years ago at age 16. ``They're going through the samething we went through, leaving their homeland because ofcommunists.''   He rejected criticisms from some black leaders that the city hasgone out of its way to accommodate Nicaraguans while doing littlefor its other poor and homeless.   ``We have a big heart for everybody,'' Canton said. ``Thesepeople need help, and the federal government isn't doing anything.We're just trying to help them get started; to give them a positiveattitude that this is the land of dreams if you work for it.''</TEXT></DOC>
