If successful, the moves would eliminate the major obstacle to setting 1988 production limits and possibly fixing base prices during OPEC's planned conference next month, industry analysts said.    Iraq, which is producing oil far in excess of its ceiling, is the chief target of a campaign by leading oil ministers to trim the cartel's production. Quota violations by Iraq and others have swollen OPEC output to about 19 million barrels a day, well above the cartel's official ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day.    Fresh impetus for the production-cutting moves came yesterday from Iran, which indicated that under certain conditions it might now agree to a higher quota for Iraq. Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, Iran's deputy oil minister, told Dow Jones International News Service that Iran would agree to an increase in Iraq's quota, but only if all other OPEC members are permitted a proportionate increase or if quotas for the Arab members of OPEC politically allied with Iraq are reduced by amounts totaling Iraq's increase.    This development follows recent proposals from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar that the current OPEC production ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day should be increased by 900,000 barrels a day.    Accommodating Iraq's demand for a higher quota is critical to stabilizing overall OPEC production. Giving Iraq a quota equal to Iran's could well transform it from a wild card within OPEC to a meaningful participant in the cartel's actions, experts say. Should OPEC eventually decide that it had to reduce overall output, for instance, Iraq might be willing to reduce its quotas if it were assured that the production cuts equally affected Iran.    Maintaining that it should be allowed to produce as much as Iran, Iraq has been the only one of the 13 members of OPEC to refuse to accept an output quota. Although it has been given a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day by the others, Iraq steadfastly ignores the limit and has been producing oil flat out in recent months. As a result, its output last month totaled 2.4 million barrels a day, equal to that of Iran. That is also Iran's quota.    Agreement on a higher quota for Iraq, coupled with that country's pledge to honor the higher ceiling, would help settle one of the issues -- production levels -- that the oil ministers must decide on at their December conference. It also would remove some of the acrimony surrounding the issue of OPEC's fixed-price level.    The chief Arab producers such as Saudi Arabia want to maintain the price at $18 a barrel for 1988. A faction headed by Iran wants a $2-a-barrel increase. But industry analysts agree that OPEC cannot have increases in both production and prices.    Iran's Mr. Kazempour said Iran is still committed to an increase in OPEC's base price to $20 a barrel for next year. He added, however, that a modest production increase may be agreed to at the December conference. He said Iran could only support such an increase so long as it &quot;instills production discipline&quot; and doesn't create more room for quota violations.    The Iranian oil official suggested that Iraq's quota could be increased if its Arab allies reduced their output. &quot;If their allies are prepared to give up production to the Iraqis, then we will not fight that,&quot; Mr. Kazempour said. </TEXT></DOC>
