(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cultural differences and national pridedistinguish Russian from Estonian and divide parent from child inEstonia, home of a small ethnic group caught between strongerneighbors for centuries.   Dissidents plan protests Feb. 16 in Lithuania and Feb. 24 inEstonia to mark the days when the Baltic republics declared theirindependence from Soviet Russia months after the Bolshevikrevolution of 1917.   Last August, in an event dissidents say showed the authoritiesthey had lost control, thousands of people marked the anniversaryof a secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Unionthat led to the 1940 Soviet takeover of Estonia, Latvia andLithuania.   Soviet authorities now are encouraging the republics' growingnon-Baltic populations to learn the native language and in somecases are seeking to restrict immigration from other parts of theSoviet Union.   People of the Baltic nations, very different ethnically from theSoviet Union's dominant Slavic population, always have maintained astrong cultural and ethnic identity.   One of the Estonian dissidents is 21-year-old Tina Hallik,daughter of faithful Communist Party members.   ``People think if I'm free, if I'm not in prison or slave laborcamp, then maybe I can do a little something. But nothing isgetting done. Nothing changes,'' said Ms. Hallik.   The dissidents are seeking permission for a demonstration in thecenter of Tallinn, capital of Estonia, on Feb. 24. They have notyet heard from officials but say they have the support of averageEstonians.   ``If they try to isolate every one (of the group) the peoplewill come out because they will have heard something ishappening,'' she said.   On Thursday, Ms. Hallik's 55-year-old mother, Klara, was amongwriters, scholars and officials from the Baltic republics takingpart in a panel discussion of national problems organized forforeign reporters by the government news agency Novosti.   Klara Hallik discounted the importance of nationalism as aproblem in Estonia, and she and other panel members drew adistinction between nationalism and cultural differences.   Her daughter said she respects her mother's views but that theysharply disagree. Superiors at work and the KGB have put pressureon her parents because of their daughter's views, Ms. Hallik said.   Little open conflict is evident between ethnic groups inEstonia. Writer Ulo Tuulik, a member of the officially sponsoredpanel, said Estonians and other ethnic groups ``could be comparedto the Mississippi and Volga rivers. We just live our own lives anddon't have great conflicts.''   Estonians number just more than 1 million and make up 61 percentof their small republic, but that figure has dropped from almost 75percent in 1959. Russians now make up 28 percent of the population.   According to 1987 official statistics, only 25 percent of theEstonians spoke fluent Russian, the dominant language of the SovietUnion. One out of 10 non-Estonians could speak fluent Estonian.   In Latvia in 1979 there were about 1.3 million Latvians and821,000 Russians, but Lithuanians made up 80 percent of thepopulation of their republic.   The official group blamed nationalist protests on a small groupof ``extremists.''   Toomas Karjaharm, a professor of history at Tallinn StateConservatory, said the protests are ``tied to social and economicproblems which have gotten worse in the past few years,'' and whichofficials are trying to solve under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformpolicies.   Officials say the number of Estonians in the republic isdropping because Estonians have one of the lowest birth rates inthe Soviet Union, and that many of the non-Estonians who move thereare young people attracted by good jobs in the republic'sindustries.   But one Estonian dissident, speaking on condition of anonymity,dismissed Gorbachev as ``a loud voice of an empty barrel rollingalong.''   To limit the migration, officials are requiring state-runindustries that seek workers outside the republic to put up about$25,000 for each worker's housing. A similar program is in effectin Latvia.   Officials also are trying to publish more books in the nativelanguages of the Baltic republics and are encouraging people ofnon-Baltic origin to learn the languages of the indigenousnationalities.   The official media also accuse Western radio stations ofstirring up nationalist feelings in the Baltics.   Most of the protests in the Baltic republics have been peaceful,but the dissidents report more surveillance and pressure.   Dissident sources say activists in Lithuania and Estonia havebeen arrested for refusing temporary military service. They chargethat the temporary call-up in both cases was an attempt byauthorities to discourage protests.   The official Lithuanian press has warned that activists faceprosecution if they disrupt public order, and Soviet PresidentAndrei A. Gromyko addressed the issue in a visit to Vilnius,Lithuania, a week ago.   Two members of a group trying to establish an alternative to theCommunist Party in Estonia, Vello Vaartnou and Eke-Part Nomm, saidthey were forced to emigrate Saturday to Sweden.   The Baltic Helsinki Group, a human rights group based inStockholm, Sweden, quoted Nomm as saying he and Vaartnou had beentold by Soviet authorities to leave the country or faceimprisonment.</TEXT></DOC>
