GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State George P. Shultzindicated Tuesday that he and Philippine leaders have scored abreakthrough in stalled talks on the future of U.S. military basesin the Philippines.   President Corazon Aquino said after Tuesday's discussions, ``Weboth hope that the talks would be over by the end of this month.''   Shultz told a news conference, ``I'm more than ever convincedthat there is a very strong mutuality of interest in the securityfield and all the reason in the world that somehow we'll be able towork out a continuing partnership.'' A review of the 41-year-oldbases agreement, which expires in 1991, has been marked by callsfrom some people for more compensation from the United States andby demonstrations against the U.S. military presence.   The review began in April and stalled over the issue of how muchWashington should pay each year for the Subic Bay Naval Base, ClarkAir Base and four smaller military installations.   Shultz, on a 36-hour visit to Manila, met with Mrs. Aquino,Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramosand prominent legislators.   He later left for Hong Kong, arriving there Wednesday for aone-day stay. Hong Kong was the fifth stop on the secretary'snine-nation Asian and Pacific tour. He earlier visited Thailand,Malaysia and Indonesia and will proceed after Hong Kong to China,South Korea, Japan and the Marshall Islands.   Both the U.S. and Filipino sides refused to discuss details ofthe compensation proposals.   House speaker Ramon Mitra told reporters, ``If the Philippine(side) gets favorable conditions, I presume this is going toregister very well among members of the house.''   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said areasonable compromise on the bases could mean increased support byWashington of Manila's war against the 19-year-old communistinsurgency.   Under the present accord, the United States gives Manila $180million a year in economic and military aid. The bases are thelargest U.S. military facilities outside the continental UnitedStates.   Manglapus said last April that $1.2 billion a year was a more``realistic figure.''   Shultz said the U.S. military had worked out options in case thebases were ousted, but the best choice was to stay in thePhilippines.   He said the two sides had ``perhaps identified some methods thatmight work'' in reaching a compromise.   Shultz also said the Philippine military had improved in thepast two years.   ``There is a far greater degree of professionalism, they arebetter equipped ... there is a clear mission and a recordincreasingly of success,'' he said.   Ramos said Shultz promised to expedite the delivery of U.S.military equipment to the Philippine military. The United Statesthis year provided more than $85 million in military help.</TEXT></DOC>
