<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-34-0996 </DOCNO><TEXT>Formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (FSA) and acetylated low-density lipoprotein(Ac-LDL) are taken up in vivo and in vitro by the sinusoidal endothelialcells of the liver. It is not known whether both these ligands are removedby the scavenger receptor. We have studied the effect of increasing concentrationsof unlabeled FSA,Ac-LDL, and endothelial cell-modified LDL (Ec-LDL) onthe endocytosis of trace amounts of these ligands labelled with /sup125/I. Uptake of /sup 125/I-Ac-LDL and /sup 125/I-Ec-LDL was stronglyinhibited by FSA. Likewise, Ac-LDL and EC-LDL reduced the uptake of /sup125/I-FSA effectively. Our data indicate that these modified LDLs andFSA are bound to and internalized via the same receptor on liver endothelialcells. 37 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
