Officials of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric and Canada's defense department are to meet here tomorrow to discuss arrangements for correcting the problems and for sharing the costs of the repairs. Canada suspended payment on the contract in ordering the delivery suspension.    Defense department officials declined to estimate the cost of the work.    The problems, which involve metal fatigue in the titanium blades of the engine's compressors, could cause engine fires, the defense department said. The U.S. Navy uncovered the defect in its investigation of two F-18 crashes in the U.S. this year.    Canada has received 116 of the 138 F-18s, which it ordered in 1980. Six of the Canadian F-18s have crashed. In the last crash, which occurred a month ago, the air force said there was evidence of an engine fire. The air force said the engines weren't responsible for the five earlier crashes. The defense department said it hasn't grounded any of the planes because of the engine problems, but it said it has tightened precautionary engine-shutdown procedures for pilots.    The officials said new F-404 engines will have compressor blades designed to better withstand high temperatures, vibration and stress. Blade replacement on existing engines is to start in February.    The defense department said a rubber mat will be installed in existing engine ducts. &quot;This will delay burn-through, giving the pilot sufficient time to identify and shut down the affected engine,&quot; the department said.    A senior official said he was &quot;very optimistic&quot; that the government could reach an agreement soon with McDonnell Douglas and GE for sharing the cost of the repair work. Deliveries of the F-18, which have been averaging two a month, will resume as soon as an agreement is worked out, he said.    The official said the Canadian air force remains &quot;extremely pleased&quot; with the F-18 and its engine. He said the plane has had fewer technical problems than many other high performance fighter aircraft.    A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said, &quot;We're working very closely with GE and the Canadian government to resolve this problem as quickly as possible.&quot; He said the F-18 contract has a total value of 2.4 billion Canadian dollars ($1.81 billion).    GE officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Canada was the first foreign country to order the F-18. It has also been sold to the air forces of Australia and Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
