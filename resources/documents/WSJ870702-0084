VW will own 51% of the venture and Ford, 49%.    The agreement, first announced last November, comes at a time when many companies are joining forces to become more efficient in troubled markets. Autolatina-Comercio, Negociaos e Participacoes Ltda. will coordinate the operation of the Ford and VW facilities, but the two companies' products will retain separate identities.    The Ford-VW venture will have an initial capitalization of $1.8 billion, as previously announced. But a Ford spokesman said the venture may scale back its initial projection of investing $1 billion in additional capital over the next five years because of problems in the Brazilian auto market, by far the larger of the two national markets.    Both Ford and the West German auto maker confirmed last week that they had each laid off 2,000 workers in Brazil because of a sales slump brought on by heavy auto taxes.    Autolatina will be the No. 1 car producer in Brazil and No. 2 in Argentina, based on Ford and VW's combined first-quarter market shares. The venture will be the largest truck producer in both countries. It has 15 plants in the two countries, with annual capacity of 900,000 vehicles. </TEXT></DOC>
