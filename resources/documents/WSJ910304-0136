Such are the fortune-cookie dreams of Harley Spiller,struggling artist and self-proclaimed expert on Chinese fastfood. Mr. Spiller, well-acquainted with the joys of cheapchow mein, has mobilized the New York art community behind anexhibit of his personal collection of 5,000 Chinese takeoutmenus.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Spiller's show at New York's Franklin Furnace galleryis filled with Oriental-American kitsch that's about asChinese as french fries are French. In addition to a 10-yearaccumulation of menus plastered over the gallery's walls, theexhibit includes interactive art (a dangling rice bagattached by pulleys to the gallery door), an assortment ofplastic delivery bags and a Knorr hot-and-sour soup box.There's even a 5-foot-long cloth fortune cookie wherevisitors can place their favorite pieces of wisdom; theperson judged to have the best aphorism gets treated to afree Chinese dinner.   Mr. Spiller has established a growing network that sendshim Chinese takeout menus from exotic locales. &quot;I got themfrom all different countries -- Sweden, Israel, L.A. . . .,&quot;he notes. But the most difficult acquisition was a genuineportable credit-card imprinter that now adorns a stuffeddummy dressed to look like a Chinese deliveryman. &quot;I musthave made 30 calls to American Express, but they keptinsisting that you had to work at a restaurant to get one. Iswore I would call every local office until someone sent itto me,&quot; he recalls proudly.   Local artists have joined in the act. Performance artistKaren Finley sent in a menu that seems to have transliteratedthe dish lo mein into &quot;war mein.&quot; Mary Lum donates takeoutboxes created out of antique Chinese paper; another artistlines commercial boxes with pine needles from theAdirondacks.   Mr. Spiller, a Midwestern transplant who claims to eatChinese food every day, believes he has found new wisdom inthe art of delivering pork fried rice in cardboard boxes.&quot;When I moved to Manhattan in 1981, I quickly embraced itsunparalleled multicultural phenomena. New York City is asavage but addicting assault on all the senses, not unlike ablazing platter of kung pao chicken,&quot; he states.   But why collect the takeout menus? &quot;Because they're freeand I collect stuff,&quot; Mr. Spiller breezily replies.</TEXT></DOC>
