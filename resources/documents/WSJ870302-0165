MangunoStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Moderates within the South Korean government and the ruling Democratic Justice Party are worried that they are fast losing their ability to constrain the military and other hard-liners whose impatience with student demonstrators and the anti-government opposition is at the breaking point.    They also are frustrated by what they consider tactical blunders by the government and intransigence by the political opposition. The moderates fear that pent-up frustrations from a seven-month political stalemate over how South Korea should be governed, aggravated by the furor over the police torture and killing of a student last month, will explode into violence and chaos on college campuses as students return this week for the spring term.    &quot;If it happens as expected,&quot; says a party moderate, &quot;it will almost certainly unleash those government hard-liners whom we've been trying to keep at bay since last October.&quot;    Most of those hard-liners, they say, are the active and retired military men who, together with President Chun Doo Hwan, a former general, hold power in South Korea. The hard-liners, the moderates say, have grown increasingly impatient with the political paralysis and exploitation of it by radicals. The moderates still constitute a considerable force within ruling circles but they feel they are losing ground.    &quot;If we gave the opposition enough rope, it would hang itself,&quot; says a government moderate. &quot;But instead we keep shooting ourselves in the foot by overreacting to their every move.&quot;    He cites the government's decision not to allow huge memorial services for Park Chong Chul, the 21-year-old Seoul National University student killed by police. Although the government has apologized for the killing, fired the home affairs minister and the national police chief, and allowed a restricted memorial service, memorial rallies for Mr. Park have repeatedly been stopped by riot police. Justice Minister Kim Sung Kye says they &quot;threaten the survival of the nation.&quot; (Another such rally is scheduled to take place tomorrow.)    The torture incident and the government's handling of public reaction to it, the government moderate says, &quot;has done more to gain middle-class support for the opposition than anything the opposition has done.&quot;    A senior executive at one of South Korea's biggest corporations agrees: &quot;Certainly the opposition behaves badly sometimes -- like stubborn and ill-tempered children who insist on having their own way. But the government responds like a brutal parent, and we find it hard to have sympathy for child abuse.&quot;    The handling of the Park case, says a Justice Party moderate, demonstrates a &quot;growing paranoia&quot; within the government about the depth of political radicalism in South Korea and &quot;an obsession&quot; with getting rid of it.    &quot;Of course,&quot; adds another party member, &quot;in the South we have for many years worried about such things -- and for good reason. As long as the North continues to threaten our security, we must stay vigilant.&quot;    The problem, the two party moderates say, is that the decision-makers in the government and the party are finding it harder to differentiate between those who disagree with government policies and those who are a clear threat to society.    They point to the government's high-profile campaign, begun last October, to &quot;root out leftists and North Korean sympathizers&quot; from the nation's universities, trade unions, religious and dissident groups, and from the political opposition.    The government has rounded up hundreds of suspected leftists, arrested as a subversive a national assemblyman who questioned if anti-Communism was a sound basis for Korea's future, and broken at least two of what officials describe as &quot;Marxist revolutionary rings.&quot; The government also has opened investigations into the background of everyone associated with those arrested, provoking accusations of McCarthyism from many, including the nation's biggest and most respected daily newspaper, Dong-A Ilbo.    &quot;We are seeing North Korean Commies everywhere now,&quot; says a Justice Party member. &quot;And we've become determined to arrest every one of them.&quot;    The result, some moderates contend, has been to drive those on the fringe of political activism into the arms of the true radicals, swelling their ranks to higher levels than at any time in recent years.    &quot;If radicalism is truly rising as rapidly as nearly everyone contends,&quot; says a government official, &quot;we are probably as responsible for it as the opposition is. The opposition coddles and encourages the radicals; we give those on the fence little choice but to jump over it.&quot;    The preoccupation with rooting out leftists, the official and other moderates contend, has distracted the national leadership from its chief goal of reaching a political compromise acceptable to the majority of South Koreans.    What the government and the party should be doing instead, says another moderate, is wooing the middle classes to its cause through &quot;moderation and irresistible reasonableness.&quot; What makes that so difficult, he adds, is the &quot;maddening refusal of the opposition to compromise&quot; on the issue of a new national constitution.    Says another government official: &quot;Every time they ask for a concession and we concede, they ask for something more, or something different, or say we didn't really give them what they had asked for the first place.&quot;    The government is seeking a parliamentary cabinet system, the opposition wants a presidential system with a popularly elected chief executive. But the real issue, each side agrees, is who will wield power after President Chun steps down, which he has promised to do when his seven-year term ends a year from now.    The moderates also criticize the leaders of the ruling party and the government for overreacting in their fear of the opposition. Says a leading moderate party member: &quot;The opposition is so divided, that if we left it alone it would almost certainly fall apart of its own rot.&quot;    A colleague, also a senior party member, adds: &quot;But we are instead allowing them to set the agenda for the political struggle. We have followed them down into the gutter, where we are now conducting the debate on the momentous issues that will decide the likelihood of Korea's long-term political stability.&quot;    The moderates say they are increasingly being regarded with suspicion and being isolated by the hard-liners in the government and ruling party.    &quot;Whichever side ultimately wins the political struggle, we who cautioned the government against excesses but refused to side with the opposition are going to be left out in the cold,&quot; says a Justice Party moderate. &quot;I think most of us realize that. But we feel the stakes for the nation are so high, that we have to keep trying to make a peaceful and reasonable compromise.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
