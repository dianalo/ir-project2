SANDI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S.-born John Hull, a supporter ofNicaraguan rebels who is under arrest on drug and weapons charges,has been moved from a hospital to a jail, his lawyer, Elda Zuniga,said Tuesday.   Hull, 69, had been in custody in a Costa Rican hospital where hewas taken on Jan. 24 after suffering a heart attack in his jail cell.   He was taken to a prison near the capital on Monday for transferto the prison in San Carlos, 105 miles northwest of San Jose nearthe border with Nicaragua, Ms. Zuniga said. She explained that SanCarlos ``is where his case will be processed because it is where thesupposed law violations occurred.''   A native of Indiana, Hull moved to Costa Rica 20 years ago andhas a ranch in Los Chiles, near San Carlos. His lawyer says hebecame a Costa Rican citizen eight years ago.   Hull was arrested on Jan. 13 on charges of drug trafficking andviolating Costa Rican security. Ms. Zuniga refiled a petitionTuesday asking that he be released on bail. A similar request wasdenied earlier.   ``We hope this request is resolved favorably because John'shealth is not completely stable,'' Ms. Zuniga said.   She holds that the government's case is unfounded because thedrug law Hull was accused of violating in 1984 was not passed until1987 and is not retroactive.   Costa Rican authorities said Hull was arrested for investigationof drug trafficking and spying for the anti-Sandinista rebels aftercomplaints by residents near his farm.   Witnesses testifying before the U.S. Congress on illegal armsshipments to the Contras have said Hull's ranch was used by gunsmugglers and cocaine traffickers.   Hull strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking.</TEXT></DOC>
