ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Borrowing a fund-raising gimmick fromWashington's wealthy socialites, the Soviet ambassador's wife heldan invitation-only fashion show at a swank downtown hotel Monday tobenefit children in earthquake-stricken Armenia.   As an added attraction, Liana Dubinin recruited her 23-year-olddaughter, Irena, as a model. A group of Senate wives, swept up inthe spirit of glasnost, pitched in to serve tea, sandwiches andpastries for about 100 high-society customers.   It was the first time in memory that the Soviet Embassy hadsponsored a benefit fashion show, a fund-raising eventtraditionally favored by the philanthropy-minded wives of wealthyAmerican capitalists.   Mrs. Dubinin, the Armenian-born wife of Soviet ambassador YuriDubinin, welcomed such Washington socialites as Buffy Cafritz andEsther Coopersmith to the mezzanine of the Madison Hotel for theopening of the three-day fashion show.   Iranian-born designer Cleopatra Broumand of New York donatedItalian knits, scarves and original evening wear designs for theevent. The wholesale prices, about half of what the Cleopatra labelusually fetches, ranged from $150 for a knit ensemble to $3,000 foran evening gown.   Irena, a graduate student in political science, said she agreedto model the clothes ``just for fun.''   Born in Paris while her father was Soviet ambassador to France,Irena is a graduate of the Institute of International Relations inMoscow and is studying for a master's degree with emphasis onrecent U.S.-Spanish relations. During her college years, her fatherwas ambassador to Spain. A twin sister, Tatiana, lives in Moscow.   Mrs. Dubinin, who came to Washington with her husband nearlythree years ago, has a particular concern for the plight ofArmenians who suffered in last December's devastating earthquake.Her father, who now lives in Moscow, was an engineer in Armeniawhen she was born, she said, and many of her relatives still livethere.   Besides her Armenian father, she said, her mother was fromSoviet Georgia. ``My husband says that is a very dangerouscombination,'' she said with a laugh.   The benefit committee supporting the fashion show included SusanEisenhower, former U.S. Protocol Chief Selwa Roosevelt and thewives of foreign diplomats and of former Defense Secretary FrankCarlucci and Arthur Hartman, former U.S. ambassador to the SovietUnion.</TEXT></DOC>
