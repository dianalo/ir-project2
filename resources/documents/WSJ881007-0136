Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, told a joint hearing of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees that the savings on the initial, space-based &quot;Star Wars&quot; phase of the SDI program can be achieved without weakening the system's ability to deter or fight off a Soviet missile attack.    The sharply reduced price results from a compromise reached earlier this fall by congressional leaders and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci through which proposed Star Wars spending curbs were withdrawn by Congress. Those curbs reflected Democrats' concerns that the Pentagon is trying to rush the deployment of space interceptors while neglecting the development of potentially more effective technologies like lasers and particle-beam weapons.    Congressional Democrats oppose deployment, arguing that it could be interpreted as a breach of the anti-ballistic missile treaty with the Soviet Union; they seek to confine SDI activities mainly to research.    The Pentagon adopted the new cost estimate Tuesday after a review panel headed by Mr. Costello approved a restructuring of SDI's first phase. The specific figures were withheld until yesterday's hearing. The Pentagon also emphasized that its review doesn't signal any intent to speed up deployment of the space-based system.    The SDI's first phase consists of kinetic projectiles carried aboard space-based vehicles, backed up by surveillance satellites and other battle-management devices. This phase primarily would combat missiles in their lift-off stages. The second phase of SDI could involve laser and particle-beam weapons that are further away from development. These latter weapons are intended to destroy any missiles that escape the first-phase interceptors.    Under the Pentagon's revised cost estimate, the proposed fleet of interceptors would be halved, but equipped with &quot;smarter&quot; missile-seeking sensors than originally planned, Mr. Costello said. That would account for $34 billion of the $46 billion slashed from the Star Wars program. The Pentagon acquisition chief said the rest of the savings would result from reducing the capability of surveillance satellites, with ground-based systems compensating for that change.    Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, director of SDI, and Gen. Robert Herres, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dismissed suggestions from members of the congressional committees that changes in the program signal a narrowing of President Reagan's original vision of creating a space shield for the entire nation. The generals predicted that SDI's first phase could be ready for deployment by the late 1990s and the full range of SDI weapons fielded in the following decade. </TEXT></DOC>
