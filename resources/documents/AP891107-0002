He is a deliberate, courtly man who entered politics more than 30years ago, working his way up the ladder one rung at a time _clubhouse worker, assemblyman, district leader, city clerk, boroughpresident.   When he defeated three-term incumbent Edward I. Koch inSeptember's Democratic primary, the top of the ladder was withinreach. On Tuesday, he defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani to becomethe 106th mayor of New York.   ``What I do is provide hope,'' Dinkins, 62, said some months ago_ hope to other blacks who want to climb up the city's powerstructure.   He is a soft-spoken, cordial man whose diction is perfect; a manwho wears well-tailored suits, made in New York's Chinatown; an avidtennis player who is said to have a very strong forehand.   Born in Trenton, N.J., the son of a barber, Dinkins earned abachelor's degree in math at Howard University after a tour in theMarines. He went on to Brooklyn Law School, graduating in 1956; hehad already married Joyce Burrows, daughter of a Harlem assemblyman.   Dinkins joined a law firm, but also joined the Carver DemocraticClub, the Harlem base of powerbroker J. Raymond Jones.   Jones, who later became Manhattan's Democratic chairman, wasmentor to a generation of black politicians, preaching a moderatecourse and encouraging compromise with the white establishment.   In 1965, Dinkins was elected to the state Assembly. His seat waseliminated by reapportionment a year later, but in 1967 Dinkins waselected a district leader from the Carver Club, a job he wouldretain for 20 years.   In 1975, he was appointed city clerk. He ran three times forManhattan borough president before winning the office in 1985.   Though none of these jobs is all-powerful, Dinkins used each postas a platform to speak out against discrimination and to supportorganized labor. He seldom took the spotlight, and he rarely madeenemies.   His one misstep was soon forgiven, though it came back to haunthim when he ran for mayor. In 1973, Dinkins was named deputy mayorfor planning, but when a background check disclosed that he hadfailed to file income taxes for four years he was forced to give upthe post.   He paid $15,000 in back taxes and ascribed his actions tonegligence.   The omission was especially surprising given Dinkins' legendarycautious nature. Before he announced his candidacy in February _promising ``a different direction, new ideas and a freshperspective'' _ he formed a committee to examine whether he shouldrun.   He ran as an unabashed liberal, but his was not a campaignbrimming with position papers and brash promises. Instead, hefocused on the need for reconciliation of the city's diversepopulation. He handily defeated Koch in the primary, 51 percent to42 percent.   In the general election, Dinkins' taxes were an issue, as werehis transfer of stock in a cable company to his son and hisacceptance of a friend's gift of a free vacation to France.   So too was his friendship with Jesse Jackson, who is distrustedby many in the Jewish community. Dinkins would not renounce Jackson,but said the former presidential candidate was not an advisor; hereminded Jewish groups that he had condemned the anti-Semitism ofMuslim Minister Louis Farrakhan.   Dinkins and his wife have lived in the same three-bedroomapartment in upper Manhattan for 26 years. They have two grownchildren and one grandchild.</TEXT></DOC>
