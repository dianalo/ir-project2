In 23 other states, testing is permitted butcan't be used to discriminate against an individual employee-- so, in effect, it's barred.   The legal barriers to HIV testing by employers soon willmove even higher. Last year President Bush signed theAmericans with Disabilities Act, the employment provisions ofwhich take effect next July. The act will bar nearly all U.S.employers of 25 or more people from discriminating in theiremployment practices on the basis of whether an individualhas a disability or is perceived to have one. Beginning inJuly 1994 the act will cover employers of 15 or more people.The act also bars all pre-employment medical screening.</LP><TEXT>   That would seem largely to end arguments over HIV testing,but it probably doesn't. The medical impact of HIV and AIDSisn't fully understood, and the economic impact has hardlybeen examined. David E. Bloom and Sherry Glied, two ColumbiaUniversity economists, question whether the present economicand legal approach to HIV testing will be effective. In arecent article in Science magazine, later reprinted by theNational Bureau of Economic Research, they assess the costsand benefits of HIV testing.   Even without prohibitions on HIV testing, the authorsnote, most small firms, after weighing costs and benefits,would be unlikely to test employees. The benefits stem fromavoiding the health-care costs associated with dealing withan HIV-positive individual, while the costs are thoseincurred in identifying him. Serious as AIDS is, itsincidence varies widely around the country. From November1988 to October 1989, the incidence of AIDS ranged from 81per 100,000 down to a single case in both North Dakota andSouth Dakota.   The authors' analysis suggests that even most large firmsalso would be unlikely to gain from testing, although somebig firms might find the testing cost-beneficial if theyrecruited mainly in areas with a high HIV prevalence.   Ironically, the area with the highest incidence of AIDS isWashington, D.C., which bans HIV testing. In fact, many otherhigh-incidence areas either ban testing or bar thediscriminatory use of the results of such tests.   As the legal limitations on testing increase, employerswill have an incentive to circumvent the spirit of theprohibitions. Employers may simply reject workers who, forone reason or another, look like they might be an AIDS risk.This could lead to ad hoc consideration of such factors asgender, race, ethnicity, age, marital status and sexualorientation. Few employers are qualified to give such factorsthe weight they might deserve and, even if they were, theycould run head-on into broader anti-discrimination statutes.Whatever the problems of HIV testing, they are likely to beless than the injustices worked by employers' eyeball tests.   Another step that employers may take is to limit theeligibility and benefits of their health-care programs. &quot;Theyare especially likely to do this,&quot; the authors write, &quot;ifindividuals who either suspect or know they are HIV-positiveelect, on the basis of that information, to work foremployers who offer generous benefit packages.&quot; This wouldleave many employees who test HIV-negative with less thanoptimal health-benefit packages -- the social cost ofachieving the distributional objectives that presumably ledto the prohibitions on testing.   With the legal barriers against HIV testing and thegenerally unfavorable costbenefit relationship, very littletesting now is being done. The new laws indicate that societydoesn't want HIV and AIDS to affect the job market, butemployers aren't going to accept the cost burden.   There are a variety of alternatives. Laws might be changedto permit HIV testing in highly restricted circumstances --for example, making sure that the results of the tests arekept confidential. Failing that, HIV testing might be morebroadly used in combination with some form of national healthinsurance or expanded welfare benefits -- taking part of thecost off employers.   There are those who argue that wider testing might providesocial benefits. One contention is that individuals whotested HIV-positive would modify their high-risk behavior.Some studies, however, have indicated that such individualssometimes increase their high-risk behavior, presumablyfiguring that they have nothing to lose. The social benefitin such cases is, of course, negative.   It may seem callous to talk about the AIDS tragedy ineconomic terms, but economic factors must be faced if thenation is ever to deal with the epidemic. The employers' roleis to provide jobs and generate income, part of which can beused to deal with national problems. Employers who focussolely on social goals and ignore the need for productivityand profits will be part of the problem, not part of thesolution.   So employers are not likely to hire workers who are farmore likely to inflate company costs than to contribute tocompany income. HIV &quot;testing&quot; is likely to go on, even thoughmuch of it will be on a catch-as-catch-can basis.</TEXT></DOC>
