Young was elected president and chief operating officer of York International Corp., succeeding Thomas J. Vincent, who will remain with the company as a consultant on international operations.    Mr. Young, 43 years old, has been president of the company's Bristol Compressor Co., and before joining Bristol in 1983 was director of product development for Rockwell International Corp.'s automotive group. The changes are effective Friday.    Stanley Hiller, York's chairman and chief executive officer, called Mr. Vincent, 54 years old, &quot;an important contributor&quot; to the company's turnaround, and said Mr. Young's promotion &quot;is a planned part of the orderly transition&quot; toward a management team to direct the future of the company.    York, which makes heating and air-conditioning systems as well as industrial refrigeration equipment, went public in March 1986. Before that, it had been unprofitable for several years as a division of Borg-Warner Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
