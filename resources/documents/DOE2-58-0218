These relationshave been empirically developed by the experimental input coming frompiston engines whose geometry differs considerably from that of the RCE.The objective of this work was to derive equations to estimate heat transfercoefficients in the combustion chamber of an RCE. This was accomplishedby making detailed temperature and pressure measurements in a directinjection stratified charge (DISC) RCE under a range of conditions. Foreach specific measurement point, the local gas velocity was assumed equalto the local rotor tip speed. Local physical properties of the fluidswere then calculated. Two types of correlation equations were derivedand are described in this paper. The first correlation expresses theNusselt number as a function of the Prandtl number, Reynolds number,and characteristic temperature ratio; the second correlation expressesthe forced convection heat transfer coefficient as a function of fluidtemperature, pressure and velocity. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
