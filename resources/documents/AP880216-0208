Acongressional study shows most high-school juniors cannot write asimple letter seeking a summer job.   A steelworker misorders $1 million in parts because he cannotread well. An insurance clerk who doesn't understand decimals paysa claimant $2,200 instead of $22.   Illiteracy caused by poor education has become an economic timebomb, threatening both the quality of the American work force andthe nation's ability to compete on world markets, governmentpolicymakers say.   The Department of Education estimates more than 27 millionAmericans older than 17 cannot read or write well enough to performbasic requirements of everyday life. Another 45 million areconsidered barely competent in basic skills.   That means more than 72 million _ one out of every three adults_ may lack the reading and writing skills they need to find work.And the number is growing annually by more than 2 million, federalofficials say.   These statistics coincide with a surge in demand for workers whonot only can read and write, but who also can use computers,understand technological concepts and think independently in aneconomy that is shifting to services and information and away frommanufacturing.   Moreover, this erosion of worker literacy comes at a time whenAmerica's competitors in Asia and Europe are forging ahead witheducated work forces that may come to dominate the high-technologybusiness of the 21st century.   ``We need to determine what to do with the substantial fractionof our population that's ill-equipped to compete in a globaleconomy,'' said Indiana University professor Lawrence Mikulecky.   A study commissioned by the Department of Labor titled``Workforce 2000,'' published last June, estimated that between nowand the end of the century, for the first time in U.S. history, amajority of all new jobs will require postsecondary education.   This prospect presents a great risk to minority workers, whohistorically have lacked the schooling and skills needed to exploitjob opportunities, said the study conducted by the HudsonInstitute, a private research organization.   If that pattern persists, the study said, ``by the year 2000,the problems of minority unemployment, crime and dependency will beworse than they are today. Without substantial adjustments, blacksand Hispanics will have a smaller fraction of the jobs of the year2000 than they have today, while their share of those seeking workwill have risen.''   The problem is compounded by a declining number of peopleentering the labor pool, a consequence of the sharp dropoff inbirth rates that followed the postwar baby boom.   Some personnel executives say the literacy crisis already hashurt them. New York Telephone Co. discovered last year that 84percent of its New York City applicants flunked the company'sentry-level exam, which included basic questions on vocabulary andnumerical relationships.   The Business Council for Effective Literacy, acorporate-sponsored group, has documented instances in whichemployees misordered millions of dollars in parts, overpaid billsand endangered work-place safety. In one case, a feedlot operatorwho misread a label killed a pen full of cattle by giving thempoison instead of grain.   Foreign companies building factories in the United States alsohave been rudely awakened. At Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S.manufacturing operations, for example, personnel managers now testthe educational level of all prospective employees.   ``They're not just assuming that because someone comes in with ahigh-school diploma, he's going to be prepared,'' said Paul Jurmo,program associate at the Business Council for Effective Literacy.   Definitions of literacy vary greatly, but some tests have servedas important guides. In 1985, for example, the Department ofEducation asked 3,400 people aged 20 and older to answer at least20 of 26 simple questions correctly. Nearly 13 percent failed.   Other measurements are considered equally discouraging. A studymandated by Congress in 1984 found that fewer than 400 of 2,00011th graders could adequately write a note applying for a summerjob at a swimming pool.   College Board test scores have fallen about 8 percent over thepast 20 years, while test performance abroad has risen. In aninternational calculus and algebra test done a few years ago, thebest U.S. 12th graders came in last among students from the mostdeveloped countries. Japanese finished first.   Estimates on the cost of work-place illiteracy also vary but arebelieved to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. TheInstitute for the Study of Adult Literacy at Penn State Universityhas said the cost is at least $225 billion per year, just in termsof lost productivity, welfare and related crime and prison expenses.   In addition, at least $25 billion is spent by companies andprivate groups to upgrade worker education, but most of this effortreaches only a small fraction of those who need it most, says DavidHarman, a Columbia University professor who has done extensiveresearch in the area.   A great deal of illiteracy remains obscured, partly because manyolder employees are sensitive about their lack of skills, fearingthey could be fired or face ridicule by seeking help.   Some devise elaborate ways to conceal inability to read orwrite, including feigning nearsightnedess or taking jobapplications home to have spouses complete them, said Eli Zal,executive director of Literacy Volunteers of New York City Inc., anonprofit group that organizes classes for adults.   There are some encouraging signs. Millions of illiterate orbarely literate adults are starting to take advantage of a growingrange of educational programs offered not only by voluntary andgovernment groups, but labor unions and employers themselves.   The federally funded Adult Basic Education program, the largestsingle literacy effort in the nation, enrolled 3.1 million peoplein 1986, up from 2.5 million in 1984.   Many large companies have started contributing money tocommunity efforts, drafted tutors to help disadvantaged workers andorganized schools of last resort to provide basic instruction.   General Motors Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.,for example, together spend at least $700 million annually on adulteducation. Other companies such as Polaroid Corp., Standard OilCo., Ford Motor Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group offerremedial classes in plants and offices.   Part of this corporate effort arises from a gradual realizationamong executives that it's in their long-term interest to have anadaptable and educated work force. But many in business still maynot appreciate the magnitude of the crisis, according to Robert W.Goddard, publication director at Liberty Mutual Insurance, whowrote on the subject in a recent issue of Personnel Journalmagazine.   ``The major force driving corporate America to attack illiteracyis the same one that united the colonies 200 years ago: Either hangtogether on this issue, or hang separately,'' said Goddard.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Feb 21</NOTE></DOC>
