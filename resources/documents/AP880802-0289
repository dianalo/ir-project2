The decision means that China will be permitted to buy computerswith double the processing speed of those it previously has beenallowed to purchase.   By eliminating the requirement that such exports be cleared byCOCOM, the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for MultilateralExport Controls, license processing should be cut by 50 days, thedepartment said.   ``This change is part of the United States' objectives aimed atmaking the multilateral export control system stronger by focusingcontrols on truly strategic equipment and reducing unnecessaryburdens imposed on industry,'' Commerce Under Secretary for ExportAdministration Paul Freedenberg said in a statement.
