Circuit Court order that toilets be provided for all farm workers. It's not the subject matter that readers may find offensive, but how collusion between a lobbying group and sympathetic judges led to new regulations.    The case of Farmworker Justice Fund vs. Secretary of Labor shows how a group can win the legal system's lottery by filing suits until it finds a friendly judge.    The case began in 1972, when El Congreso, representing agricultural workers, asked the Labor Department to require toilets in the fields. The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration responded in 1976 with a &quot;proposed rule-making&quot; by asking for public comments on the idea. The comments were negative. The cost of outfitting distant fields with such facilities could bankrupt inestimable farms and ranches. Workers had always roughed it, but if they wanted to trade off lower wages for more accessible toilets they could without any regulations.    El Congreso sued when Labor decided not to issue regulations. The D.C. Court of Appeals rejected the claim in 1977, noting that there is no requirement that the executive branch regulate toilets. There is, it said, the &quot;traditional agency discretion to alter priorities and defer action.&quot;    The farm-workers group filed another claim in 1978, which Labor settled in 1982 by agreeing to hold more hearings. It again decided in 1985 not to issue any regulations. Yet another suit was filed. To stanch the litigation, Secretary Bill Brock promised to ask the states to act. He offered a model rule that would mandate one toilet for every 20 workers within one-quarter mile of a work site or at the closest road. He said that federalism allocates such health issues to the states, which are more efficient monitors of local farms than Washington. The feds would stick to such health-threatening problems as asbestos.    El Congreso went to court for the fourth time last year, and this time El Congreso won the judge lottery. Judge Patricia Wald, who with Abner Mikva is the most notorious activist on the circuit, was assigned to the case. In the ruling issued last week, Judge Wald (joined by fellow liberal Judge Hubert Will who usually sits in Chicago) ignored the circuit court's earlier acknowledgement that the executive branch had the discretion not to issue regulations. She ordered OSHA to require toilet facilities &quot;to bring to an end this disgraceful chapter of legal neglect.&quot; She could not find any statute requiring toilets. Instead, Mr. Brock's &quot;particular vision of 'federalism'&quot; was flawed. He must regulate, she wrote, because he can't rely on the states to do so.    The dissent by Judge Stephen Williams, a recent Reagan appointee, was incredulous. He noted that 75% of farm workers are already covered by state regulations. He also emphasized that Mr. Brock is entirely free either to issue regulations or not. &quot;The majority sidesteps precisely the point that counsels judicial restraint: that the effectiveness of the Secretary's use of resources in this area comes at the expense of his not using those resources in other areas.&quot;    There is some &quot;deja vu&quot; here of the pre-Reagan judiciary. This case was a symbol of the regulatory excesses of the 1970s. When Malcolm Wallop campaigned for Wyoming senator in 1976, he ran a TV spot featuring a cowboy riding a horse with a Port-O-Potty dangling from the saddle.    The Justice Department is urging Mr. Brock to appeal the decision to the entire D.C. Circuit. The 3-to-1 victory ratio for this case's past litigation should be encouraging. If he has any doubts, Mr. Brock should recall that Sen. Wallop defeated the incumbent in a landslide. </TEXT></DOC>
