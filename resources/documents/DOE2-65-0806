At the same time, the environmental problems causinga major part of the rapidly changing laws and regulations and issuesof imported fuel dependency indicate an urgent need for new energy technologies.One important way of supporting new technology development is to createand maintain a proactive national energy policy. Stability and balancein such a national policy would lessen the perceived risk to other non-governmentenergy technology investors. Federal funding of development projectsdesigned by utility companies would encourage investment by the utilityindustry while ensuring a technology's applicability to future use byutilities. The national photovoltaics effort now stresses basic research,with little emphasis on technology development and almost no emphasison demonstration. In order to progress in the most effective and timelymanner, a more balanced approach will be necessary. Utility companiesare interested in photovoltaics, but their willingness to invest in developmentof the technology wavers due to uncertainties concerning the regulatoryenvironment, economics and the need for new generating capacity in thefuture.</TEXT></DOC>
