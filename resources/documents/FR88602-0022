Background  </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 14, 1981 (46 FR 36333), FDA announcedthe agency's plan for conducting a systematic review of its rules and askedthe public to comment on those FDA regulations that are perceived to bethe most burdensome. The purpose of the review was to identify regulationsthat impose unnecessary burdens on the public generally or on specificsegments of the public such as small business and, for such regulations,to explore alternative measures for protecting the public health. FDA'sreview of its regulations was initiated in response to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-364), which requires all regulatory agencies to initiatea review of any regulations which can have a significant impact on smallmanufacturers, and to Executive Order 12291, which requires agencies toexamine new and existing regulations for possible significant impacts onthe industry as a whole. Subsequently, as a result of the assessment ofpublic comments received in response to FDA's notice and of other availableinformation, the agency published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 2, 1982 (47 FR 29004), that identifiedthe rules initially selected for highest priority review. The July 2, 1982,notice also advised that FDA intended to select other rules for review. Although the July 2, 1982, notice did not identify the regulation concerningthe procedure used to grant variances from performance standards for electronicproducts, FDA's experience in implementing the regulation since 1974 indicateda need for its review. Therefore, FDA conducted a comprehensive reviewof this regulation in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354), Executive Order 12291, and FDA's experience in implementing theregulation for the past 14 years. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Variance Regulation  </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 18, 1974 (39 FR 13879), FDA publishedits procedures for granting variances from performance standards for electronicproducts (21 CFR 1010.4). FDA issued the regulation under the authorityof the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Radiation Control forHealth and Safety Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 263f).  Since publishing the 1974 regulations FDA has published several correctionsand amendments to the variance regulation to provide consistency with otherregulations (46 FR 8957; January 27, 1981, and 50 FR 7518; February 22,1985). On August 17, 1979, FDA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>an amendment to eliminate a requirement thatFDA publish a notice of issuance of a variance and allow a 30-day objectionperiod (44 FR 48190).  The current variance regulation (21 CFR 1010.4) consists of four paragraphs:Paragraph (a), <T3>Criteria for variances, </T3>determines when FDA will grant a variance; Paragraph (b), <T3>Applications for variances, </T3>specifies the contents of an applicationfor a variance;  Paragraph (c), <T3>Ruling on applications, </T3>explains FDA's procedures for approving,denying, amending, or withdrawing a variance and informing the applicantand the public of its actions on an application for a variance;  Paragraph (d), <T3>Certification of equipment covered by the variance, </T3>describeslabeling changes to be made by manufacturers (1) to state that the productconforms to the performance standard except for the characteristics coveredby the variance; (2) to state that the product conforms to the variance;and (3) to provide for the inclusion of the assigned number and effectivedate of the variance. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Review of the Regulation  </ITAG>FDA initiated a retrospective review of this regulation by analyzing regulatoryactions taken as a result of its requirements. The agency also reviewedthe costs, benefits, and other effects of the regulation. The purpose ofthe review was to identify any changes which would minimize unproductivedisruption of the marketplace while maintaining an optimum level of publichealth protection.  As a result of the review, FDA has determined that the regulation continuesto serve the purpose for which it was developed; that is, the criteriafor granting a variance, the specific contents of an application for thevariance, the procedures for FDA to grant or withdraw a variance, and theappropriate labeling changes to accommodate a variance have served FDA'sgoal of assuring that electronic products are reasonably safe and effectivewhile relieving manufacturers of some unnecessary requirements on a case-by-casebasis. Therefore, FDA is not proposing any substantive changes in the requirementsof the regulation.  Based upon review of correspondence and applications for variances receivedfrom manufacturers of electronic products, FDA is proposing clarifyingchanges to help applicants to more readily understand the requirementsand thus to expend fewer resources in submission of applications.  Also, the agency is proposing to remove the requirement in the varianceprocedure (andSection; 1010.4(c)(2)) that a notice of availability of theapproved variance be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The agency believes that publication of thenotice of approval is no longer necessary. FDA also believes there is alack of public interest in the variance procedure, as evidenced by a completeabsence of responses to published notices of availability of approved variances.Interested persons have suggested that FDA announce its approval of variancesin publications such as trade journals and FDA's own publications ratherthan in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. FDA may adopt this procedure.  If FDA issues a final rule upon its proposal to amend the regulation soas to remove the requirement that the agency announce variance approvalin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, FDA would continue to maintain the administrativerecord of each variance action as it now does. The agency would continueto file the applications for variance and for amendments and extensionsof a variance as well as all correspondence on the applications with theDockets Management Branch and make them and nonconfidential backgroundinformation available under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. <T3>et seq.</T3>). Removing the requirement for announcement of the approvalof variances in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>would not speed up approval of variances, becauseapproval of variances takes place before FDA's publication of notices ofavailability of the variances. The proposed change in procedure would,however, conserve FDA's resources. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Environmental Impact  </ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Economic Impact  </ITAG>FDA has carefully analyzed the economic effects of this proposed rule andhas determined that the rule would not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities as defined by the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. In accordance with section 3(g)(1) of the Executive Order12291, the impact of this proposed rule has been carefully analyzed, andit has been determined that the proposed rule does not constitute a majorrule as defined in section 1(b) of the Executive Order. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Submission of Comments  </ITAG>FDA invites comments from the public and regulated industry regarding toproposed amendments to the regulation. Intrested persons may submit writtencomments, data, or information to the Dockets Management Branch (addressabove). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except individualsmay submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket numberfound in brackets in the heading of this document. Written comments areto be submitted by August 1, 1988; however, comments received after thatdate will be considered, if possible. Any comments data, and informationsubmitted in response to this notice will be available for inspection inthe Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday throughFriday. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 1010  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Electronic products, Exports, Radiationprotection.Therefore, under the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the RadiationControl for Health and Safety Act, and under authority delegated to theCommissioner of Food and Drugs, it is proposed that 21 CFR Part 1010 beamended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1010_PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS: GENERAL </ITAG>1.
