It is shown that at low bias voltagethe electron irradiation does not change the charge-carrier transportmechanism. A change of the current-voltage characteristics of GaAs diodesinduced by increase of the irradiation dose is due to a rise of resistanceof the diode base, resulting from a compensation of the base after thebombardment and to the appearance of double injection of the charge carriersinto the diode base. It is found that a sublinear section of the current-voltagecurve, which appears at high irradiation dose, is a result of the formationof a near-anode stationary high-field domain. Analytical expressionsare obtained which describe well the experimental current-voltage characteristicsfor the irradiated diodes. The sensitivity of the irradiated diodes tothe hydrostatic pressure is described by means of analytical formulaeand numerical calculations, taking into account the pressure dependenceof the width of the gap, energies of the gap levels induced by irradiation,and the lifetime of the charge carriers injected into the base region.A rise of the sensitivity of the diodes to the hydrostatic pressure withthe irradiation dose is due to the appearance of the radiation-inducedstates within the gap.</TEXT></DOC>
