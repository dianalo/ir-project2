Gorbachev'srestructuring drive eventually may enable Soviet computer makers tosatisfy demand, but progress will be slow and Moscow can be expectedto keep trying to acquire Western technology, a U.S. scientificadvisory panel says.   It said the United States should take a more focused and flexibleapproach to export controls on computers, especially since theexisting curbs on many components and systems have become virtuallyunenforceable.   The panel urged the United States to concentrate instead onstriving _ together with its NATO allies and Japan _ to controlleakage to the Soviet bloc of militarily valuable supercomputers andthe most advanced computer manufacturing processes.   ``The United States cannot afford to be complacent about itscomputer technology strengths or base export control decisions on anassumption of an invincible lead,'' said the National ResearchCouncil report released Thursday.   Preparing the 288-page study was a 17-member committee chaired bySeymour E. Goodman, professor of management information systems andpolicy at the University of Arizona, Tucson.   The National Research Council is the principal operating agencyof the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering.   The report estimated that the Soviet Union lags about five yearsto 10 years behind the West in many computer technologies.   ``The lag between East and West is now large enough that theacquisition-diversion of certain Western technologies for directproduction will help the Soviets tremendously,'' it said.   Referring to Gorbachev's perestroika or restructuring drive, thereport said that ``if perestroika actually fails to bring aboutfundamental changes in the Soviet economy, collection efforts willsurely increase.   ``On the other hand, if perestroika succeeds, the Sovietcomputing industry may finally find itself in a position to fullymeet demand, and the Soviet military may find itself getting thesame kind of support from its own computing industry that it nowmust get by using the Western computer industry as a surrogate,'' itsaid.   But the report added that ``the full effects of perestroika willbe a long time coming, and transformation of the Soviet computerindustry cannot happen overnight. In the meantime, the acquisitionof Western technology would seem to appear even more attractive tothe Soviet computer industry as it tries to close the gap.''   On U.S. export controls policy, it noted that ``as the computermarket becomes increasingly global, U.S. firms face increasingforeign competition, mostly from firms operating with fewer exportbarriers under the same CoCom guidelines.''   CoCom is the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral ExportControls, comprising the United States, Japan and all NATO countriesexcept Iceland.   ``Tighter U.S. controls may reflect the absence of a fullyeffective multilateral control effort, but there is a risk that inthe computer area, the United States may lock the proverbial barndoor after the horse has escaped,'' the report said.   It concluded that ``current technological progress will makecontrols harder to enforce, and technological and marketdevelopments combine to make a case for a more focused and flexiblecontrol process.''   Increasingly powerful computer hardware and software, the studysaid, are in effect becoming commodities in world trade.   ``Commodity products are available in high volume and at lowcost, they may be available in multiple and substitutable forms, andthey tend to be small and easy to transport,'' it said. ``Theseattributes make commodities vital to the economic health of thecomputer industry, but also effectively uncontrollable.''   The report recommended that the United States publish a list ofcomputer technologies that are commodities. The government thenshould promulgate a policy exempting such commodities from exportcontrols, at least for trade among CoCom nations.   On the other hand, it said, the State Department should work withother agencies to focus export control efforts on ``computertechnologies of compelling military importance'' that could enableSoviet bloc countries to make substantial gains in their technologybase.   In particular, the report cited advanced chip fabrication lines,supercomputers and other high-performance computing systems,computer-aided design systems, and magnetic and magneto-opticalmaterials.   The study also said the United States should involve newlyindustrializing countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan andSouth Korea into the CoCom program.</TEXT></DOC>
