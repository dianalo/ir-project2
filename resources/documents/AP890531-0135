(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Richard Arrington asked onWednesday that a special state prosecutor be appointed to determinewhether federal agents illegally tried to frame him and other blackBirmingham officials.   ``I have an obligation to try to remove any cloud of suspicionover this office,'' Arrington said at a news conference.   The mayor says a developer, Robert Moussalem of suburbanTrussville, told him FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents weretrying to entrap Arrington in a phony land deal.   Moussalem, who has been charged with bribery, says agents wereafter Arrington and other black officials from Alabama's largestcity, including City Council President William Bell, CouncilmanJeff Germany and state Rep. John Rogers. Arrington becameBirmingham's first black mayor in 1980 and is in his third term.   The mayor released a letter in which he asked Attorney GeneralDon Siegelman to appoint H. Lewis Gillis of Montgomery, a formerprosecutor, as a special assistant attorney general to look intothe accusations.   ``This investigation will focus on whether certain personsengaged in criminal solicitation, conspiracy, attempted briberyand-or obstruction'' of the city's governmental operations, theletter said.   Arrington said the city would pay Gillis' expenses but that hisinvestigation would be independent.   Requests for the appointment of a particular prosecutor are notthat unusual, said Joy Patterson, a spokeswoman for Siegelman,adding that the attorney general was not immediately available tocomment.   U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson has said that Moussalem'sallegations are too absurd to merit comment.   Arrington's special counsel, Donald Watkins, said Donaldson andthe Justice Department ``have a conflict of interest in this. Itwould be a conflict to prosecute Moussalem and use him as amaterial witness in another matter.''   A federal grand jury indicted Moussalem on May 1 on charges thathe tried to bribe undercover agents to call off tax audits andinvestigations.   Arrington released a copy of a Nov. 23 letter from Donaldson toMoussalem that offered favorable consideration of his criminalcharges in exchange for his cooperation and immunity for any actshe committed under federal direction.   ``Unfortunately a number of black elected officials have beenput under a cloud without criminal charges against them,'' Watkinssaid. ``We just want to get to the bottom of it and find out whatis going on.''   He also said that ``there appears to be a concerted effort todiscredit and taint through innuendo certain black officials.''   Watkins said that ``we want to find out the truth, no matter whomay be affected. Somebody is lying and we need to find out who'slying.''  </TEXT></DOC>
