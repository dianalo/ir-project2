The Labor Department said civilian joblessness fell from April'srate of 5.3 percent, with a decline in the number of people lookingfor work offsetting an anemic expansion of non-farm payrolls.   Financial markets reacted favorably to the report, whichimmediately renewed speculation among economists over whether theFederal Reserve is ready to relax its tight hold on credit in theface of a slowing economy.   ``Are they going to ease on the basis of this report alone? No,I don't think so,'' said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for theMortgage Bankers Association and a former Fed governor.   Only 101,000 new jobs were added to the economy last month, thelowest monthly total since 84,000 in March 1986 and well below theaverage monthly gain of 275,000 jobs for 1987 and 1988. The averagemonth-to-month gain over the last three months has slipped to160,000.   ``It suggests to us that we're going to have either slow growthor no growth in the second half of the year,'' said Merrill Lynchchief economist Donald H. Straszheim. ``This slowdown is not astatistical fluke _ it is an event.''   ``This is a rather weak report on employment but I don't see anyindications of recession,'' said Gramley.   ``The economy certainly does not appear to be headed near-termfor a recession,'' said Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic AdvisersInc.   There was a bit of good news on inflation as average hourlyearnings increased just 0.1 percent last month on a seasonallyadjusted basis after shooting up more than 0.6 percent from Marchto April.   But coming on the heels of a report showing first-quarter unitlabor costs rose 6.6 percent on an annual basis, analysts said theencouraging wage data in the unemployment report was not enoughevidence to say inflation was waning.   The slowdown in payroll expansion was essentially across theboard, with declines in the goods-producing industries and gains onthe service-producing side well below robust 1987 and 1988 averages.   Construction payrolls fell by 14,000 and manufacturing jobs by18,000, according to the Labor Department's survey of businessestablishments. Overall, the goods-producing sector lost 33,000jobs last month.   Growth in the service-producing sector offset some of thoselosses but was sluggish nonetheless, including the slowestmonth-to-month gain in service jobs _ 65,000 _ in six years.   Wholesale trade added just 2,000 jobs last month and retailtrade 17,000, while governments expanded their payrolls by 32,000workers, the government said.   The Labor Department said the average private-sectornonagricultural workweek fell 0.3 hours, to 34.6 hours. The averagefactory workweek also fell last month, slipping 0.2 hours to 41hours while average overtime fell an equal amount to 3.8 hours.   Those could be further signs of slowing growth, but the LaborDepartment cautioned that they also could reflect adjustments fromApril, when the data was skewered somewhat because formulas forseasonal influences did not take into account that Easter holidaysfell in March this year instead of April.   The unemployment rate declined despite such sluggish job growthbecause, the government said, there were 49,000 fewer people in thecivilian labor force last month. The number of unemployed Americanswho were actively seeking jobs fell 151,000 to 6.39 million lastmonth.   The government said the number of part-time workers last monthwho wanted to work full time fell by about 300,000, to 4.8 million.   Declines in the unemployment rate were reported for both whiteand black adult men while joblessness soared among black women andblack teen-agers.   Unemployment among white adult men fell from 4 percent to 3.6percent in May while the rate dropped among black men from 10percent to 9.4 percent.   For white women, the unemployment rate last month was unchangedat 4.1 percent while for black women it shot up from 8.8 percent to9.5 percent.   Unemployment for black teen-agersclimbed from 26.2 percent to28.4 percent. The rate among white teen-agers was 11.2 percent,down from 11.5 percent.   Among Hispanics, unemployment dropped from 8.3 percent to 7.9percent, said the government, which does not provide a gender orage breakdown for Hispanics.   A separate calculation that includes military personnelstationed in the United States put May unemployment at 5.1 percent,down from 5.2 percent.   The report included a number of revisions to previous databecause of several annual steps the department takes in an effortto increase the accuracy of its surveys. Those changes included areduction of 595,000 in the government's estimate of job growth inthe last two years.</TEXT></DOC>
