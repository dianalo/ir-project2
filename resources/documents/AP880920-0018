Cynthia Taeuber of the Census Bureau said Monday that officialshave decided to hold a separate count, a few days before theregular national census, in an effort to count those living on thestreets and in shelters.   The homeless have become an increasingly visible part ofAmerican society, but there are no concrete estimates of theirnumbers.   On March 20, 1990, Census takers will visit emergency shelters,both public and private, and will go to various street locationswhich have been identified as places the homeless congregate, saidTaeuber.   The street search for the homeless will be conducted from 2 a.m.to 4 a.m., and shelters will be visited from 6 p.m. to midnight,she said.   Census officials will be working with various groups andagencies that serve as advocates for the homeless, explainedTaeuber, in order to determine in advance where to look for thesepeople.   In addition, the agency will encourage people with those groups,and the homeless themselves, to work as enumerators in the count.However, these workers will have to pass the same written exams andother criteria as all Census workers.   Census day for most of the nation is April 1, 1990. The count ofthe homeless is being taken a few days early, however, because manyshelters close at the end of March or beginning of April, Taeubersaid.   She added that the Census Bureau will not try to define whoconstitutes a homeless person. Instead it will merely issue countsof people living on the streets and those staying in various typesof shelters.</TEXT></DOC>
