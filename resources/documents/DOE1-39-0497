The method is currently widely used in applications ranging fromfundamental research to routine analytical measurements. In recent yearsNMR imaging has emerged as an important diagnostic tool in medicine.The manufacture of commercial instruments based on magnetic resonancemethods has given rise to new technologies.</TEXT></DOC>
