The main factor influencing the content of Canada's hydrogenprogram is the decreasing availablility of petroleum and the increasein electricity as energy sources. It is recognized that energy storageand hydrogen systems will facilitate this transition. The principal Canadianstrength in this area is the fabrication of water elecrolyzers whichare exported worldwide, but in the energy storage sector, particularlyelectric batteries, Canada's presence is very limited. The Canadian hydrogenprogram is based on a directive plan which has evolved taking into accountinitiatives done outside the program, particularly in Ontario and Quebec.The overall objective is to secure capabilities within the areas studied,and particular objectives and programs are outlined in the subcategoriesof hydrogen production, hydrogen use, energy storage and electrochemicalresearch. Strategies adapted for attaining program objectives have beenconceived in terms of particular circumstances, the principal influencesbeing the availability of resources and the importance conceded to theresearch in other countries. This report contains a brief review of thecontent and context of research activity, and an appendix provides acomplete list of the reports produced within the program's framework.Important events or significant progress are noted in a chronologicaloverview. There is also an examination of possible improvements, newchallenges and possibilities in hydrogen research. 45 refs., 13 figs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
