Pat Schroeder,D-Colo., said Thursday as the House approved the child caremeasure, which is expected to cost $22.7 billion over the next fiveyears. ``The Congress is more enlightened than a lot of peoplethought,'' she said.   The House overwhelmingly rejected a smaller $17.2 billionadministration-endorsed child care plan that would have eliminatedrequirements for state regulation of child care providers. Thesubstitute, offered by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, was defeatedon a 230-195 vote.   Also rejected by a 285-140 margin was an amendment by Rep.Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., mirroring Bush's proposal last March toexpand child care aid solely through tax credits.   Democratic leaders refused to allow a vote on competingproposals on how to divide up some $1.75 billion in new directsubsidies. Instead, they sent both to a conference with the Senate,which approved its own child care package last June.   The child care measure was included as part of a bill to reducespending by nearly $11 billion in fiscal 1990, which began lastSunday. The overall bill, with a variety of unrelated proposalssuch as a cut in capital gains tax rates and a repeal of theyear-old catastrophic care program for the elderly, was approved ona 333-91 vote.   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia predicted afterthe House's action Thursday that Bush would veto the entire bill ifHouse-Senate negotiators retain language specifying regulatorymandates and restricting aid for church-provided child care.   Both the Senate version and one of the House versions targetmuch of the aid toward establishing child care facilities in thepublic schools.   However, the House also armed its negotiators with a versionwritten by its Ways and Means Committee to provide the $1.75billion in new direct subsidies over the next five years throughexisting entitlement block grants to the states.   That plan, supported by governors as well as churches, wouldallow the new aid to continue flowing to church-supported childcare centers through voucher programs.   Stenholm's measure would have dropped requirements that statesinspect child care centers and provide 15 hours of annual training.It also would have ended current child care tax deductions of up to$2,400 for families with incomes above $90,000.   ``We believe the family is the best determiner of how child careshould be provided, not the federal government,'' Stenholm said inleading the attack on the proposed standards.   Supporters of the proposed standards, however, argued thatincreasing the quality of child care is just as important asincreasing its availability and reducing the cost of it to poorfamilies.   ``The federal government has found it appropriate to regulatethe type of food we eat so that our health is protected,'' saidRep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y. ``Clearly our health is important andso are our children. They deserve the finest and the best care wecan provide for them.''   All the surviving proposals would double the size of thepreschool Head Start program for poor children and convert it intoa year-round, 10-hours-a-day operation.   The bulk of the new aid _ $13.5 billion over the next five years_ is in the form of increased Earned Income Tax Credits for poorfamilies with children under age 12.   Basically the credits would expanded by a maximum of $200 to$300 for each child in qualifying families plus another $430 perfamily if one or more of the children is under age 6.</TEXT></DOC>
