Thursday's vote followed a narrow Democratic vote earlier thismonth to close debate on the bill.   Fifty-five Democrats voted for the measure and none against. TenRepublicans also supported it.   The House already has passed a similar legislation and the Houseand Senate will have to work out differences in the bills.   Republicans had been delaying since shortly after the strikebegan March 4. President Bush has refused to appoint an emergencyboard, under provisions of the Railway Labor Act, to investigatethe strike.   That refusal led to Democratic criticism Thursday of Bush'shandling of the strike. Some 30,000 machinists, flight attendantsand pilots have been out of work as a result.   ``Mr. President, nobody is asking you to come down on the sideof the workers, the strikers,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,D-Ohio. ``Nobody is asking you to come down on the side ofmanagement.''   Metzenbaum cited 34 previous occasions under which Democraticand Republican presidents have appointed emergency boards, causingsettlement of 26 strikes without a work stoppage.   ``But for some reason that I don't understand, this president isreluctant to provide some leadership in bringing about a settlementof the case,'' Metzenbaum said.   Bush has said management and employees should resolve theproblem.   Under the bill, a Democrat and a Republican from the House andone each from the Senate would be appointed by their respectiveleaders in Congress to the commission.   The panel would make recommendations on how to settle the strikeand make further recommendations on maintaining competiveness inthe airline industry. The panel also would make recommendations onhow to protect employee collective bargaining rights in bankruptcyproceedings involving air carriers.   The report will be due in 45 days after enactment.   Five days after the Eastern strike began, the company filed forprotection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act. Eastern has beencontinuing efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court and theairline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier two-thirds itsformer size.   Eastern was purchased by Frank Lorenzo in 1986, and he has beenaccused by strikers and Senate Democrats of siphoning awayEastern's cash and assets. He has been criticized for allegedlydraining the assets of other airlines as well.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said: ``We are delighted thatthe Senate has approved this labor-supported proposal, whichprovides a process that should lead to a fair and equitablesettlement of the Eastern Air Line strike. We urge the House acceptthe Senate bill and the president to quickly sign it into law.''</TEXT></DOC>
