Twoothers are using the automatic teller machines nearby.   Meanwhile, at a branch of a major local bank half a blockaway, more than 20 people stand impatiently in a queue thatsnakes through the lobby toward distant tellers perchedbehind thick, counter-to-ceiling bulletproof plastic. Sevenother customers stand outside in sweltering heat to use thebank's streetside ATMs.</LP><TEXT>   For Ms. Lo, one of the many young Hong Kong professionalsthat Citibank targets, the appearances are important. &quot;Youcan tell they're better; it's a big difference from localbanks,&quot; she says.   The scene repeats itself, with variations, across much ofAsia. Whether financing motor scooters in Bombay or marketing&quot;preferred&quot; gold credit cards to yuppies in Singapore,Citibank is doggedly pursuing in Asia its goal of becoming aglobal consumer bank -- the grand vision of John Reed,chairman of Citibank's parent, Citicorp.   Perhaps nowhere has Citibank been more successful than inAsia, competing with entrenched domestic banks on their ownturf by offering innovative services, new technology and, asin Ms. Lo's case, giving customers what they want. In somecountries, Citibank is nudging entire banking sectorsforward, though analysts warn that domestic monoliths haveawakened and competition may intensify.   Citibank officials imagine that in a few years, customerswill be able to tap their accounts through ATMs around theworld. Already, there are 22 Asian banking centers atCitibank offices in such cities as New York, Los Angeles andLondon to serve mobile Asian clients.   &quot;Citibank behaves in every market like a local bank,&quot; saysthe general manager of another U.S. bank in Hong Kong.&quot;They've taken a much bigger chance than other foreignbanks,&quot; which traditionally have left the retail side todomestic banks.   Pei-yuan Chia, group executive in charge of Citibank'sinternational consumer banking, says the bank intends toreach 10 million affluent Asian households by the end of thedecade, a fivefold increase from the present. That's anexpensive proposition when stretched across Asia, from Japanto India. And the cost could rise if economic growth slows orbanking liberalization stalls in just a couple of thosecountries.   &quot;Probably every bank that is looking at the retail side ofbanking is looking at Citibank as the benchmark,&quot; says BrianWaterhouse, a banking analyst for James Capel (Far East)Ltd., an affiliate of Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp.Another analyst calls Citibank a &quot;screaming success in Asia.Citibank's approach in consumer banking has been excellent.&quot;   The bank's approach in Hong Kong is based on years ofexperience with its giant New York network. Citibank evensent out Steve H. Price, former head of consumer banking inNew York, to run the North Asia division. Mr. Price saysconsumer banking in the British colony is nearly as advancedas in New York, and that Citibank is positioned even betterin Hong Kong than in New York. &quot;We're more successful becausewe're really tightly focused,&quot; he says.   That focus is the top 30% to 50% income bracket of thepopulation, to whom the bank markets itself as a statussymbol and a leader in service in a competitive bankingenvironment. &quot;If you want to buy from K mart, don't come tous, but if you think Gucci is the right thing, then we arethe right thing,&quot; Mr. Chia says.   Ms. Lo is the perfect Citibank target. She is a chicaccountant in her early 30s who works in the colony's Centralcommercial and financial district. She has accounts atseveral banks and knows the rates paid at others. Aftershopping around, Ms. Lo chose Citibank because it paid moreon foreign-currency deposits than local banks did. And, Ms.Lo says, the bank's advertisements didn't lie: Citibankservice is better.   Like local banks, Citibank plans to stay in Hong Kongafter the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Itsexposure in the territory seems to highlight the riskCitibank runs by investing in many Asian markets at once.Problems in one country could hurt the bank regionwide.   For example, more than half of Citibank's Hong Kong loanportfolio is in home mortgages, most of which stretch beyond1997. Hong Kong people might walk away from their debts, somebanking analysts caution. But Mr. Price says the mortgagesare made mostly to the &quot;people who will stay in Hong Kong.&quot;   Other Citibank officials note that the bank has profitedin more volatile locales. In the Philippines, where arevolution and a series of coup attempts in the past fewyears have crippled the economy, Citibank benefited becausecustomers shifted their deposits to it from local banks. Moregenerally, bank officials say, Citibank's regional strategyensures that if operations in one country suffer, steadybusiness in the rest of Asia will compensate.   Citibank's Asian strategy is costly. Officials won't sayhow much the bank is investing in the region, except that itis &quot;a lot and not enough.&quot;   Investment is concentrated in two areas: credit cards andtechnology. Telebanking and sophisticated ATMs help the bankovercome the disadvantage of government limitations on localbranch networks. In Japan, nearly 30% of the bank's customerswere able to open their accounts without ever stepping into abranch office. In some cities, Citibank provides personalbankers so that customers can become familiar with the sameperson over time.   Citibank's approach to local banking often seemsfar-fetched in the region's less-developed markets. InTaiwan, for example, the idea of a mortgage was revolutionaryuntil the mid-1980s, so much so that the government wasreluctant to let Citibank offer mortgages.   Home purchases in Taiwan long were financed in the Chinesetradition, borrowing from family or tapping lifetime savings.But as property prices soared and more young people enteredthe housing market, Citibank saw an opening. Citibank'srequests to offer home mortgages were turned down twicebefore regulators in Taipei decided in 1985 to &quot;give thosecrazy Americans a chance,&quot; as one Citibank executive puts it.Today, Citibank remains ahead of its competition in themortgage business.   Citibank officials now plan to introduce telebanking sothat customers can bank without having to negotiate Taipei'snotorious traffic to reach one of the two branches. ButCitibank remains limited to two branches to serve the islandrepublic's 20 million people. Further expansion depends inpart on the continuation of banking liberalization, as is thecase in South Korea and Thailand, where Citibank repeated itssuccess in mortgages and where the bank is also restrictedfrom enlarging its branch network.   &quot;Where markets are highly protected, there's a limit as tohow much Citibank can do,&quot; says Richard Wong, a principalwith Egon Zehnder International Ltd., an internationalexecutive search firm. &quot;But if you assume liberalization,Citibank should be able to expand.&quot;   So far, the governments of the three countries areconvinced that Citibank is helping to improve consumerbanking overall. But local banks are pressing regulators toslow liberalization so they can regroup to fight the foreigncompetition.   Government restrictions are a problem in 10 of the 15Asian countries where Citibank now operates. &quot;That's a bignumber,&quot; says Citibank's Mr. Chia.</TEXT></DOC>
