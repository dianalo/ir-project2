She didn't even cry,&quot; said her mother, JoanMilne. &quot;It went better than we anticipated. After it was over, every kid cameup and gave her a hug. A couple even gave her a kiss.&quot;;    Melissa'smuch-rehearsed announcement, which was made last week, was one of thecarefully planned steps her family is taking to make the community aware ofthe facts about Melissa's illness.;    School officials, who learned ofMelissa's condition in January, prepared her classmates with discussions aboutthe human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS. On the day of Melissa'sannouncement, each of the 360 students in the school brought home a letter fortheir parents from Principal Paul Sheckler explaining that Melissa &quot;wants herfriends and the community of Indian Valley School to know she has an immunedeficiency commonly known as . . . HIV.&quot;;    Sheckler made it clear Melissawill be allowed to stay in school. Public health officials will meet withconcerned parents this week.;    &quot;Kids have a right to attend school if, likeMelissa, they're not a danger to the public health,&quot; said Francis Wise, whodirects the Contra Costa County public health department's communicabledisease division.;    Milne is hopeful that going public with her daughter'sillness, which was contracted through a blood transfusion at birth, will helpother families.;    &quot;If a child had leukemia or cancer, they would get supportfrom their community,&quot; Milne told the Contra Costa Times. &quot;We get none ofthat. It's a socially unacceptable disease. The families dealing with it arein a crisis, yet at the same time we're being shunned. We call ourselves, 'Thefamilies in the shadows.' &quot;;    So far, people have reacted calmly toMelissa's announcement, Sheckler said.;    But Milne said she warned herdaughter that reactions may not all be good. She recalled campaigns to keepRyan White and other HIV-infected children out of schools and the fire-bombingof a Florida home after it was revealed that three of the family's childrencarried the HIV infection.;    &quot;I told her that when some people found out,they wouldn't be very nice because of it,&quot; Milne said. &quot;I tried to explain toher that it's not because of her, but because they're afraid of the virus.&quot;;   Two weeks ago, Melissa's teacher asked the class what they would do if theyhad a friend who was HIV-positive.;    &quot;Everyone said they'd be kind. So thatmade me feel good,&quot; Melissa said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Walnut Creek  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910610  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  485  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday June 10, 199100162100,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
