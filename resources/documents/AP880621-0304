The May increase, less than the gains of 0.5 percent in Marchand 0.4 percent in April, would amount to an annual inflation rateof 4.2 percent if prices climbed at the same pace for 12 months,the Labor Department said.   Food prices prices rose just 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.6percent increase in April. Analysts said the only area where theeffects of the drought showed up were in higher retail prices forvegetable oil and mayonnaise.   The biggest price increase was for gasoline, up 1.7 percentafter a 1.1 percent increase in April. Gasoline prices, however,are still just 2.9 percent higher than they were a year ago.   Automobile prices rose 0.2 percent last month with the paring ofmany dealer incentives.   Stock prices opened higher today on the New York Stock Exchangean hour after the inflation report was issued. The Dow Jonesaverage of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 20 points in slowtrading Monday as analysts had anticipated a larger increase in theConsumer Price Index.   ``It was pretty low compared to expectations,'' John Hagens, ananalyst for the Wefa Group, an economic consulting firm in BalaCynwyd, Pa., said of the price report. ``The food picture hasn'treally passed into the CPI yet.''   For the first five months of 1988, overall retail prices haverisen at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, the same pace they grew in1987, the government said.   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said last week that theReagan administration remains optimistic that its targetedinflation cap of 4.5 percent for 1988 will not be exceeded.   However, low unemployment-spurred wage gains that have beenoutpacing price increases over the last three months plusanticipated future food price hikes from the current drought in theFarm Belt have triggered fears of a inflationary wage-price spirallater this year or in early 1989.   Leading the food price increases were gains for meats, poultry,fish and eggs, up 0.8 percent last month compared with a 1.4percent rise in April. Price increases for fruits and vegetablesalso slowed from their 1.4 percent rise in April to 0.6 percent inMay.   The increases for other food and beverages were one-half of 1percent or less.   ``The drought and major hikes in commodity prices that we'reseeing are scary, but it's just too soon for them to have reachedthe retail market,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist for theFutures Group, a Washington consulting firm.   Donald Ratajczak, an economist who directs his own survey ofwholesale and retail prices from Georgia State University inAtlanta, said poultry was a key ingredient in higher consumer foodprices last month.   ``The poultry producers may be responding to higher feed costs,but they are the result more of large U.S. soy meal sales to theSoviet Union last fall than the drought,'' he said.   About the only place where the 1988 drought could have reachedthe retail level so far, Ratajczak said, is in the prices ofvegetable oil and mayonnaise. Those prices rose 0.8 percent in May,but account for only one-fourth of 1 percent of the consumer priceindex.   Medical costs jumped 0.7 percent in May and are now 6.4 percenthigher than they were a year ago, making them the single biggestpropellant of inflation in the Consumer Price Index.   But prices for women's clothing, which had skyrocketed a totalof 7 percent in March and April, fell by 0.4 percent last month.   ``Apparel prices have softened and the large increases there areover,'' said Ms. Shaber. `There's a lot of stiff consumerresistance out there. Retailers already have put the stuff onsale.''   The 0.3 percent increase in the overall index in May was thesmallest since a 0.2 percent rise in February.   The May figures raised the index to 117.5, meaning that ahypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84 baseperiod would have cost $117.50 last month, a dime more than inApril.   While severe inflation has yet to rear its head, analysts expecta combination of drought-related commodity shortages and decade-lowunemployment to push prices up faster in 1989.   Hourly wage increases, for example, have outpaced priceinflation the last two months after lagging way behind for morethan a year.   To some, like Ms. Shaber, the wage increases can only beexpected at some point to catch up with price inflation. But toother analysts, particularly those with close ties to the financialmarkets, the prospect is scary.   ``We're definitely getting an acceleration of inflation and thebeginning of a wage response to that,'' said Allen Sinai, aneconomist for the Boston Co., and New York consulting house. ``Ithink we're in the incipient stages of a wage-price spiral.''   Ratajczak said higher feed costs resulting from the drought willprompt ranchers to send more cattle to slaughter, putting aninitial downward rather than upward pressure on food prices.   ``However, the reduced meat supplies then will increase foodinflation in 1989,'' he said. ``And higher food inflation mayintensify wage demands, leading to modest acceleration in 1989.''   That modest acceleration is defined by Ratajczak as 5.5 percentinflation next year.</TEXT></DOC>
