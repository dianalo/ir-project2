 Three possible casescenarios where the Value Pack is useful are discussed.andP;  Thesescenarios are: removing copy protection from a hard disk, removingcopy protection from an original System Disk, and using the ValuePack with a new package of Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  Directions for correctingerror messages are also presented.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Lotus 1-2-3 Value Pack (Utility program) (usage).andO;Topic:     TutorialCopy Prevention TechniquesFile ManagementDisk Drives.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Goodbye Copy ProtectionandM;If you're like many users of the IBM version of 1-2-3, you've feltinconvenienced by copy protection.andP;  Perhaps damaged protection files renderedyour System Disk unusable.andP;  Or maybe damaged protection files on yourhard-disk system forced you to use a System Disk as a &quot;key&quot; disk to start1-2-3.andP;  Or maybe you never had problems with copy protection until you triedto use the Lotus 1-2-3 Value Pack to remove it--then your troubles began.andO;Well, you're not alone.andP;  Lotus Product Support reports that since the 1-2-3Value Pack shipped just over a year ago, it has received a record number ofcalls on the subject of removing copy protection.andM;Regardless of your experience with copy-protection removal, this article willmake it easy for you to use the 1-2-3 Value Pack to remove copy protectionfrom your System Disk or hard disk.andP;  Three possible scenarios would requirethat you use the 1-2-3 Value Pack: (1) removing protection from your harddisk, (2) removing protection from your original System/Backup System Disk,and (3) using the 1-2-3 Value Pack with a new package of 1-2-3.andM;Following a discussion of the three scenarios is a list of possible errormessages, along with instructions for correcting the error conditions.andO;Remember, to perform these steps, you must be using the IBM version of 1-2-3,and you must have the 1-2-3 Value Pack Disk.andP;  For information on how toobtain the Lotus 1-2-3 Value Pack, see the box on page 79.andM;CASE 1andM;REMOVING COPY PROTECTIONandM;FROM YOUR HARD DISKandM;Before beginning, check the size of your 123.COM file to determine whether ornot you have already transferred copy protection to the hard disk.andP;  Change tothe subdirectory containing your 1-2-3 program files.andP;  Then type dir 123.comand press Return.andP;  The file name followed by the file size appears.andP;  If thefile is 2,000 bytes, 1-2-3 is copy-protected on the hard disk, and you shouldproceed with the following steps.andP;  If the file size is 2,304 bytes in 1-2-3Release 2.01 or 2,048 bytes in 1-2-3 Release 2, 1-2-3 is not copy-protected,and you should proceed with the directions under case 2.andM;1.andP;  Make sure you have enough memory.andP;  1-2-3 requires an additional 4K ofmemory after you remove copy protection, and that may cause a problem.andP;  Start1-2-3 and retrieve your largest worksheet.andP;  Then press the slash key andselect worksheet Status.andP;  Check the available amount of conventional memory.andO;If it's greater than 4,096 bytes, proceed with removing copy protection.andP;  Ifavailable memory is less than 4,096, you may not want to use the 1-2-3 ValuePack to remove copy protection, since to do so means that you won't be ableto use your largest worksheet.andP;   After checking available memory, press theEscape key to return to the worksheet.andP;  Then select/Quit Yes to exit 1-2-3.andM;2.andP;  Insert the Value Pack Disk in drive A.andP;  Type a: and press Return.andM;If your computer has both a high-density drive and a low-density drive,however, insert the Value Pack Disk in the low-density drive.andP;  By doing so,you'll be able to use the Value Pack Disk to remove copy protection fromother computer systems that have only low-density drives.andM;These directions assume that drive A contains the Value Pack Disk.andP;  If youuse a drive other than A, substitute that drive letter.andM;3.andP;  To begin name registration, type init and press Return.andP;  Read theintroductory screens, then press Return to continue.andP;  The program prompts youto enter your name and your company's name.andP;  After you make an entry, theprogram asks you to confirm it by pressing Y for Yes or N for No.andP;  If youpress N, you can reenter the names.andM;Once you confirm the names, a screen appears displaying your name, yourcompany's name, and the version of 1-2-3 that you're using.andP;  You'll see thisscreen each time you start 1-2-3.andP;  If the screen contains any incorrectinformation, hold down the Control key and press Break to restart theprogram.andP;  If all the information is correct, press Return.andM;A message indicates that you have completed name registration.andP;  Press Returnto continue.andM;4.andP;  Now remove copy protection.andP;  Specify the drive and directory containing1-2-3.andP;  After a few moments, a message indicates that 1-2-3 is nowunprotected, and the program returns you to a DOS prompt.andP;  If you use 1-2-3Release 2.01, continue with step 5; if you use 1-2-3 Release 2, proceed tostep 6.andM;5.andP;  If you use 1-2-3 Release 2.01, you must copy an updated version of thefile named INSTALL.SCR from the Value Pack Disk to the subdirectorycontaining your 1-2-3 program files.andP;  Change to that subdirectory.andP;  With theValue Pack Disk in Drive A, type copy a:install.scr, and press Return.andP;  Amessage indicates that one file has been copied.andM;Next copy the updated INSTALL.SCR file to the floppy disk that contained theoriginal file.andP;  If you use the 5-1/4-inch version of 1-2-3 Release 2.01, theoriginal file is on the Utility Disk.andP;  If you use the 3-1/2-inch version ofRelease 2.01, the original file is on the Install Disk.andP;  Remove the ValuePack Disk and insert the Utility or Install Disk in drive A.andP;  Type dira:install.scr and press Return.andP;  You should see the file name INSTALL.SCRfollowed by the file size and date of creation.andP;  If the message File notfound appears instead, check that you inserted the correct disk in drive A.andO;Then reenter the command, making certain that you specify the appropriatedrive and spell the file name correctly.andM;Once you locate the original file, copy the file from the hard disk to thefloppy disk.andP;  Type copy install.scr a: and press Return.andM;6.andP;  Now you can start 1-2-3.andP;  Enter 123 or lotus at the subdirectory promptcontaining your 1-2-3 program files.andM;Once you've removed copy protection from your hard disk, you'll want toremove if from your original System/Backup System Disk.andP;  Follow the case 2directions for doing so.andP;  Then you can use the DOS COPY *.* command to makebackup copies of your program disks.andP;  Do not use the DOS DISKCOPY command tomake backups.andP;  If you wish, you can use the Value Pack Disk to removeprotection from other copies of 1-2-3.andM;CASE 2andM;REMOVING COPY PROTECTIONandM;FROM YOUR ORIGINAL SYSTEM DISKandM;You'll want to remove copy-protection files from your original System/BackupSystem Disk if any of the following conditions exist:andM;* You use 1-2-3 on a floppy-disk-drive system.andM;* You damaged the copy-protection files on your System/Backup System disk andwant to restore that disk to working order.andM;* You copied the 1-2-3 program files to the hard disk, but you nevertransferred copy protection to the hard disk.andP;  Consequently, you arecurrently using the original System/Backup System Disk as a &quot;key&quot; disk.andP;  Thismeans that you must insert the System Disk in the floppy-disk drive each timeyou start 1-2-3.andM;If any of these conditions exist, you should:andM;1.andP;  Follow step 1, case 1.andM;2.andP;  Follow step 2, case 1.andM;3.andP;  Follow step 3, case 1.andM;4.andP;  After you complete step 3, case 1, the Value Pack program asks you tospecify the drive and directory containing your 1-2-3 rpogram files.andP;  Removethe Value Pack Disk from drive A and replace it with the originalSystem/Backup System Disk.andP;  Press Return twice.andP;  After a few moments, amessage indicates that 1-2-3 is unprotected.andM;If you do not have a hard disk, skip to step 5.andP;  If you have a hard disk towhich you previously copied your 1-2-3 files, you need to check for thepresence of a file named 123.COM on you hard disk.andP;  This file was part of theold copy-protection system, and you need to erase it from your hard disk.andM;From the subdirectory containing your 1-2-3 program files, type dir 123.comand press Return.andP;  A file name and size appear.andP;  If you use 1-2-3 Release 2and the COM file is 2,048 bytes, or if you use 1-2-3 Release 2.01 and the COMfile is 2,304 bytes, type erase 123.com and press Return.andP;  Then proceed withstep 5.andM;If the 123.COM file is 2,000 bytes, the protection on the hard disk may bedamaged.andP;  If you use the 5-1/4-inch version of 1-2-3 Release 2.01, insert theUtility Disk in drive A, type a:zap 123, and press Return.andP;  You will see themessage Typing Y at this point will erase files necessary to run yourinstalled Lotus product.andP;  Type CTRL C to quit or Y to continue.andP;  Enter y.andO;Now double-check that the file has been removed.andP;  Type dir 123.com and pressReturn.andP;  The message File not found appears, indicating that the COM file isgone.andP;  Now proceed with step 5.andM;If you use the 3-1/2-inch version of 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 or the 5-1/4-inchversion of 1-2-3 Release 2, you'll need to change the read-only attribute ofthe 123.COM file before you erase it.andP;  Use the DOS ATTRIB command, availablein DOS 3 and higher.andM;To use the DOS ATTRIB command, change to the sub-directory containing yourDOS files.andP;  Assuming your 1-2-3 program files are in a subdirectory named123, type attrib -- r c:\123\123.com and press Return.andP;  If you receive themessage Bad command or file name, make sure that you are in the subdirectorythat contains your DOS files and that you correctly entered the command.andM;Once you correctly change the file attribute, erase it.andP;  First change to thesubdirectory containing your 1-2-3 program files.andP;  Then type erase 123.comand press Return.andP;  Now go to step 5.andM;5.andP;  If you use 1-2-3 Release 2, skip to step 6.andP;  If you use 1-23 Release2.01, complete step 5, case 1, then complete step 6, which follows.andM;6.andP;  Now you can start 1-2-3.andP;  If you have a hard disk, enter either 123 orlotus at the 1-2-3 subdirectory prompt.andP;  If you have a floppy-disk-drivesystem, insert the System Disk in Drive A and enter either 123 or lotus.andM;If you wish, use the DOS COPY *.* command to make backup copies of yourprogram disks.andP;  Do not use the DOS DISKCOPY command to make backups.andP;  You canalso use the Value Pack Disk to remove the protection from other copies of1-2-3.andM;CASE 3andM;USING THE VALUE PACKandM;WITH A NEW PACKAGE OF 1-2-3andM;If you have a new package of 1-2-3, you must remove copy protection beforeyou copy the floppy disks to your hard disk.andM;1.andP;  Follow step 2, case 1.andM;2.andP;  Follow step 3, case 1.andM;3.andP;  The Value Pack program asks you to specify the drive and directorycontaining your 1-2-3 program files.andP;  Remove the Value Pack Disk from drive Aand replace it with the original System/Backup System Disk.andP;  Press Returntwice.andP;  After a few moments, a message indicates that 1-2-3 is unprotected.andM;4.andP;  Follow the directions in the Value Pack manual for installing yoursoftware.andP;  Follow step 5, case 1.andP;  Use the DOS COPY *.* command to makebackup copies of your program disks.andP;  Do not use the DOS DISKCOPY command tomake backups.andP;  You can also use the Value Pack Disk to remove protection fromother copies of 1-2-3.andM;ERRORSandM;Directions for correcting anyandM;error message you receiveandM;No matter how faithfully you try to follow the preceding instructions, errosmay occur.andP;  Here are some error messages you may receive, followed byinstructions for correcting the conditions: No key disk in drive A: No keydisk in drive C: Product has been uninstalled Unauthorized duplicate LoadFailed 12andM;All of these error messages are caused by the continued presence of a filenamed 123.COM, which was part of the old copy-protection program.andP;  You needto erase this file from your hard disk.andM;From the subdirectory containing your 1-2-3 program files, type dir 123.comand press Return.andP;  The file name 123.COM followed by the file size appears.andO;If you use 1-2-3 Release 2 and the COM file is 2,048 bytes, or 1-2-3 Release2.01 and the COM file is 2,304 bytes, type erase 123.com and press Return.andM;If the 123.COM file is 2,000 bytes, the file is damaged.andP;  If you use the5-1/4-inch version of 1-2-3 Release 2.01, insert the Utility Disk in drive A,type a:zap 123, and press Return.andP;  You'll see the message typing Y at thispoint will erase files necessary to run your installed Lotus product.andP;  TypeCTRL C to quit or Y to continue.andP;  Enter y.andP;  Now double-check that the processremoved the file.andP;  Type dir 123.com and press return.andP;  The message File notfound appears, indicating that the COM file is gone.andM;If you use the 3-1/2-inch version of 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 or the 5-1/4-inchversion of 1-2-3 Release 2, you'll need to change the read-only attribute ofthe 123.COM file before you erase it.andP;  Use the DOS ATTRIB command, availablein DOS 3 and higher.andM;To use the DOS ATTRIB command, change to the subdirectory containing your DOSfiles.andP;  Assuming your 1-2-3 program files are in a subdirectory named 123,type attrib--r c:\123\123.com and press Return.andP;  If you receive the messageBad command or file name, make sure that you're in your DOS subdirectory andthat you correctly spell the command.andM;After changing the file attribute, erase it.andP;  First change to thesubdirectory containing your 1-2-3 program files.andP;  Then type erase 123.comand press Return.andM;1-2-3 has not been had-disk installed or is not a supported release.andM;This error message appears if you try to remove copy protection from a harddisk to which you never transferred copy protection or if you try to use theValue Pack disk on a non-IBM version of 1-2-3.andP;  It may also appear if youattempt to remove copy protection while you have RAM-Resident programsrunning in the background.andP;  If that's the case, remove the programs frommemory and then try to remove the copy protection.andM;If you use an IBM version of 1-2-3 and get this error, check the size of the123.COM file.andP;  Change to the subdirectory containing your 1-2-3 programfiles.andP;  Type dir 123.com.andP;  The file name and size appear.andP;  If you use 1-2-3Release 2.01 and the 123.COM file is 2,304 bytes, or 1-2-3 Release 2 and the123.COM file is 2,048 bytes, you have not transferred copy protection to thehar disk.andP;  Follow the case 2 instructions for removing copy protection fromthe original System Disk.andM;Not a valid system disk.andM;This error message may appear when you attempt to run the Install programafter you have removed the copy protection from 1-2-3 Release 2.01 on yourhard disk.andP;  The error is caused by the absence of an updated INSTALL.SCRfile.andM;Copy the INSTALL.SCR file from the Value Pack Disk to the subdirectorycontaining your 1-2-3 program files on your hard disk, as well as to youroriginal Utility Disk (5-1/4-inch version) or original Install Disk(3-1/2-inch version).andP;  Then you'll be able to run the Install program withoutgetting this error.andM;The disk in the drive you specified does not contain enough free space forValue Pack to run.andM;This error message occurs when your original System/Backup System Diskdoesn't have enough disk space for copy-protection removal.andP;  In general, thisoccurs because you mistakenly saved files on the System/Backup System Disk.andO;Here are three common solutions: delete the COMMAND.COM file from the disk;copy worksheet files from the System/Backup System Disk to another disk; orcopy the file named 123.HLP from the System/Backup System Disk to anotherdisk.andP;  Details on these options follow.andM;If you use a hard-disk system, make sure you have a copy of the fileCOMMAND.COM on your hard disk.andP;  Then insert your System/Backup System Disk indrive A, type a: and press Return.andP;  Next type dir command.com and pressReturn.andP;  If the message File not found appears, try one of the solutionsdescribed in the following two paragraphs.andP;  If the file name and size appear,you know that you can erase it from your System/Backup System Disk.andP;  Typeerase command.com and press Return.andM;If you use 1-2-3 on a floppy-disk-drive system, do not erase the COMMAND.COMfile from the 1-2-3 System/Backup System Disk.andP;  Instead, insert yourSystem/Backup System Disk in drive A, then type dir a:*.wk1 and press Return.andO;If the System/Backup System Disk contains any worksheet files, a list willappear.andP;  If such a list exists, use the DOS COPY *.WK1 command to copy thefiles from the System/Backup System Disk to another formatted disk.andP;  Then usethe DOS ERASE *.WK1 command to erase the worksheet files from theSystem/Backup System Disk.andM;A final option for users of floppy-disk systems is to copy the file named123.HLP from the System/Backup System Disk to another formatted disk and thenerase the file 123.HLP from the System/Backup System Disk.andP;  The drawback tothis solution is that you'll need to insert the disk containing 123.HLP intothe floppy-disk drive each time you press the HELP key.andM;If you choose this last solution, insert the System/Backup System Disk indrive A and a formatted disk in drive B.andP;  Type a: and press Return.andP;  Typecopy 123.hlp b: and press Return.andP;  Finally, type erase 123.hlp and pressReturn.andP;  With the help file gone, you'll have enough room to remove copyprotection from the System/Backup System Disk.andM;HOW TO GET THE 1-2-3 VALUE PACKandM;If all the Lotus 1-23 Value Pack offered was the ability to remove copyprotection, it would still be worth the $15 investment.andP;  But the 1-2-3 ValuePack offers more than that.andP;  It contains two add-ins--Lotus Speed-up andLotus Learn, both of which work only with 1-2-3 Release 2.01.andP;  Speedupimproves recalculation time.andP;  Learn helps automate macro writing.andP;  Severalnew display and printer drivers are included, as well as 180 days oftoll-free telephone support.andM;To obtain the 1-2-3 Value Pack directly from Lotus Development Corp., call800-426-7682 (in Canada, 800-447-4700) and charge it to your MasterCard,Visa, or American Express.andP;  Or send a check or money order for $15 to LotusDevelopment Corp., Center VP, P.O. Box 9168, Cambridge, MA 02139-9168.andP;  Besure to specify part number ANU-450 for 5-1/4-inch media or part numberANU-440 for 3-1/2-inch media.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
