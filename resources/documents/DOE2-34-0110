In single crystals that have noncentrosymmetry with respectto the sites of precessing nuclear-quadrupole moments, the electronicpolarizability of atoms and chemical bonds on opposite sides of the nuclear-quadrupolemoment is not the same. The oscillating electric field produced by thequadrupole moment induces a net electric dipole moment in its neighboringelectronic environment. The coherent summation of these dipole momentsover the Boltzmann distribution of the nuclear ensemble produces an oscillatingmacroscopic electric dipole moment. The sample is placed between theplates of a capacitor that is tuned with an inductance to the nuclearprecession frequency. Coherent nuclear precession is initiated followinga rf magnetic field pulse that tips the nuclear spins into the precessionmode. The voltage signal from the capacitor gives rise to an oscillatingcurrent in the series circuit and magnetic flux in the inductor. Straymagnetic induction pickup signals are balanced out. The flux is coupledto a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which producesa voltage output at the nuclear-quadrupole resonance frequency of {similar_to}30MHz for /sup 35/Cl nuclei in NaClO{sub 3} at 4.2 K. The /sup 35/Cl nucleusinduces electric dipole moments in nearby oxygen atoms bonded to theCl atom. Measured free-precession electric signals are compared to thepredictions of a point-oxygen-atom polarizability model applied to theCl: O bond. The technique is sensitive to chirality and to bond angles.</TEXT></DOC>
