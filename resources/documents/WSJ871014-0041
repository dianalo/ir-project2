In an interview yesterday, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger confirmed that a Pentagon investigation indicates the Iranians probably took the U.S.-made missiles from a rebel caravan. Pentagon officials stressed that much of the information collected so far has come from rebel and Pakistani sources, that the inquiry is still in progress, and that additional details may emerge.    Mr. Weinberger, however, said that, based on the information gathered so far, &quot;I don't have any evidence&quot; that the American-backed Afghan Mujahedeen sold the missiles to Iran.    Intelligence sources said the convoy of trucks was delivering the missiles to rebel leader Ismail Khan, a former Afghan army officer whose guerrillas have operated around the city of Herat in western Afghanistan, when one of the trucks broke down. These sources said the mishap apparently occurred close to the Iranian border. Local revolutionary guardsmen grabbed the missiles -- that are fired from the shoulder -- when the Afghans sought help to repair the truck.    The revolutionary guard is a powerful political and paramilitary organization in Iran.    The report that the Iranians appropriated the missiles from an Afghan convoy contradicts a new Iranian claim that the missiles were part of a secret arms deal negotiated by former National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane. Fereydon Pezeshkan of the South-North News Service, an American-run independent news agency, reported yesterday from Tehran that an Iranian source claimed the missiles were delivered aboard the plane that brought Mr. McFarlane to a secret meeting with Iranian officials in Tehran in May 1986.    Through his lawyer, Leonard Garment, Mr. McFarlane yesterday denied selling any Stingers to the Iranians. &quot;This is another fabrication,&quot; Mr. Garment said.    The account of the waylaid Afghan convoy suggests that the Iranians have only a handful of the sophisticated, heat-seeking missiles, too few to pose a significant threat to American warplanes and helicopters in the Persian Gulf, intelligence officials said.    In addition, U.S. officials noted that the Stinger is a complex, sophisticated weapon which the Iranians aren't trained to use and which aren't likely to be effective when fired from small speedboats, such as those used by the Iranians in the Persian Gulf. Intelligence officials also give little credence to Iranian claims to be manufacturing copies of the missiles.    U.S. military officials were surprised to discover Stinger batteries and other parts on an Iranian boat last week after Army helicopters returned fire from four small Iranian vessels, disabling three of them. The discovery led to widespread speculation that the Afghan rebels, who have been receiving Stingers from the Central Intelligence Agency and who have sold or traded other weapons to the Iranians, may have sold some of the missiles to Iran.    American intelligence sources and officials familiar with U.S. aid to the Afghans discounted the theory however, arguing that the Mujahedeen have received relatively few Stingers and would be unwilling to part with their most effective defense against Soviet jets and helicopter gunships. &quot;The Stingers are the most effective weapons the Mujahedeen have,&quot; said one official. &quot;If they sold them, they'd only use the money to try to buy more Stingers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
