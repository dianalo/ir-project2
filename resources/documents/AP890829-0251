Bruce Bartlett, deputy assistant secretary for economic policy,compiled a list of 86 countries, showing that 55 have lowered theirtop rates since 1985. Only two _ Lebanon and Luxembourg _ haveincreased them. The 29 others have kept the same rate.   Some have enacted reductions that have not yet gone into effect,he added.   In Japan, the highest rate has gone down to 50 percent from 70percent, and in France to 56.8 percent from 60 percent. Britainremained steady at 60 percent. Bartlett pointed out that Britain'sreductions had started earlier, from higher rates than in the UnitedStates.   Italy went down to 50 percent from 65 percent.   ``There's no way of explaining these policies except by theleadership of the United States,'' he said in an interview.   The top U.S. rate went down to 28 percent from 50 percent.   He called rates over 50 percent ``confiscatory,'' saying, ``theyonly serve to justify high rates on lower incomes.''   ``When someone with a low income pays 25 percent, it's consolingto think that the fellow with millions is paying 90 percent,''Bartlett said.   He said high rates encourage people and money to leave a country,discourage effort and do not increase total revenues.   The southern African republic of Zambia, one of the world'spoorest countries, has the highest top rate of the 86 on his list.It dropped only to 75 percent from the 80 percent of 1985. Theaverage Zambian earned $240 in 1987.   Bartlett cautioned that the top rate is applied to very differentincomes in different countries. In Mexico, for example, the 40percent rate is charged on incomes over $13,170. In Honduras, almostnext door, that is also the top rate, but it is applied only onincomes of $500,000 in a country where the average income in 1987was $780.   ``You should get as close as possible to a flat rate,'' Bartlettsaid, adding that he would favor a flat rate for the United States.   A flat rate charges the same percentage against all income, highor low. The U.S. system was designed as a progressive tax, based onthe taxpayer's ability to pay, with higher rates on higher incomes.   Bartlett praised Bolivia, where he said the 10 percent rate _ thelowest on his list _ is a flat rate.   Many governments, unlike the United States, rely for theirrevenues more on sales taxes than on income taxes.   He pointed out that his figures do not include social securitytaxes, taxes for health services and local income taxes. The topfederal rate in Canada, for example, is only 29 percent but inQuebec the total tax burden can reach 49.1 percent, he calculated.   His figures were drawn from tax guides issued by twointernational accounting firms, Price Waterhouse and Coopers andLybrand. They were first published in a table in Tuesday's WallStreet Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
