BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iowa is done. New Hampshire is history. It's onto Super Tuesday.   On March 8, voters in 20 states and America Samoa will statetheir presidential preferences in the biggest one-day primaryseason balloting ever.   Democrats will choose 1,307 delegates, almost a third of all thedelegates to the national convention in Atlanta. Republicans willpick 712 delegates, again about a third of the delegates to the GOPconvention in New Orleans.   To raise the stakes a bit, look at it this way: on Super Tuesdayalmost 63 percent of the magic number of delegates needed to winthe nomination will be selected.   Although 14 of the 20 states are Southern or border states, thecandidates are faced with a disparate set of voters _ from thetextile-and tobacco-dominated Carolinas through booming Georgia andFlorida to the oil-depressed states of Louisiana and Texas.   Here is a look at how the races are shaping up in each state:</TEXT><HEAD>ALABAMA</HEAD><TEXT>   The race remains cloudy in Alabama, where about 20 percent ofthe 2.3 million registered voters are black.   Republicans have spent little time campaigning for the 38delegates. Tom Coker, a veteran political organizer who directs theBusiness Council of Alabama, said he feels the top three finishersmay be no more than 10 to 12 percentage points apart, with VicePresident George Bush first and former television evangelist PatRobertson battling Sen. Bob Dole for second.   On the Democratic side, much of Jesse Jackson's civil rightstime was spent in Alabama and he has benefited from thatrecognition.   Early polls showed Jackson in the lead with better than 20percent, followed closely by Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., withMissouri Rep. Richard Gephardt third. But those polls had largeundecided blocs, and it's expected that Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis and Gephardt improved their standing here after early wins.   Alabama has 56 Democratic delegates at stake.   Another factor in Alabama is the Democrats' attempt to limitcross-over voting by adopting a rule preventing anyone from votingin the Republican presidential primary March 8 and then coming backand voting in any Democratic primary in June when state and localnominees will be chosen. The Republican Party has no similar rule.   The rule may discourage some generally conservative Democratsfrom voting in the Republican primary as they have tended to do inyears past. It also may turn some independent conservativeRobertson voters into Republicans.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>AMERICAN SAMOA</HEAD><TEXT>   The smallest player on Super Tuesday is American Samoa, whereabout 300 people are expected to participate in the DemocraticParty caucus that night. The South Pacific territory will sendthree delegates to Atlanta.   Chairman Utu R.M. Sinagege says the caucus will decide whetherdelegates will go instructed or uncommitted. ``We would rather waitto see where the trend is going ... who doesn't make the cut,'' hesaid.   In American Samoa, people don't have to show proof of partyregistration to attend a caucus. ``The place is so small, everyoneknows everybody and it would be hard for anyone (who is notDemocrat) to slip into the caucus,'' Sinagege said.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>ARKANSAS</HEAD><TEXT>   Arkansas Republicans expect a large turnout that may benefitRobertson and hurt Bush, who was ahead early, said state executivedirector Dorothy English. She attributes many of the newRepublicans to Robertson's candidacy.   In all, about 1.2 million Arkansans are eligible to vote March8, up about 5,000 from 1986.   About 16 percent of the population is black.   Democratic executive director Kip Blakely says Jackson and Goreare the perceived leaders, but he says Dukakis and Gephardt aregaining strength. ``It looks like a four-man race,'' he said.   Blakely predicts an average turnout of Democrats, about 450,000to 500,000 for the primary. However, the turnout of Republicans maytriple or quadruple with 75,000 to 100,000 expected to vote.   ``I think you're going to see Pat Robertson people crawl outfrom under the woodwork,'' Blakely said.   Arkansas has 38 Democratic and 27 Republican delegates at stake.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>FLORIDA</HEAD><TEXT>   After Texas, Florida has the biggest chunk of delegates with 136Democrats and 82 Republicans up for grabs.   Dukakis has been in Florida early and often. His campaign set upoffices last August with 16 full-time staffers and has added staffsteadily since Iowa and New Hampshire. Phone banks have beenrunning in all 19 congressional districts.   Gephardt has successfully raised money here, and is counting on87-year-old Rep. Claude Pepper, the nation's most popularDemocratic campaigner, to get out the elderly vote, which mighthurt Dukakis.   Jackson, who boasts six campaign offices in the state, has anactive grassroots organization.   Gore's main presence has been his father, former Sen. AlbertGore Sr., who the campaign is using in South Florida retiree areas,and in conservative northwest Florida.   Most Democratic officials say the race is too close to call andpolls in the last 10 days generally give Gary Hart, Jackson andDukakis the most strength, although Hart's support may beattributed to name recognition.   Simon Ferro, a member of the Democratic National Committee, saidthat although Florida is a media state, ``you still need anorganization to get the people out and to pass the word.''   ``Gephardt probably has the weakest organization in Florida buthe does have the endorsements of a number of officials. Whetherthey can provide the organization for him, I don't know,'' Ferrosaid.   ``If Dukakis does well, it will prove that money and good, earlyorganization does pay off,'' said Katharine Kelly, a member of thestate's Democratic Central Committee.   Bush has the most extensive Republican campaign, running withfive full-time professionals headed by state executive director KenWright.   Although Robertson continues to outspend Bush, and is consideredstrong is some GOP pockets, particularly North Florida, Bush hasenjoyed commanding leads in nearly every poll conducted recently.   In an effort to catch up, Dole was in Florida last week andplans later trips.   The latest registration figures, which are more than 15 monthsold, showed Florida with 3.2 million Democrats, including 554,585blacks, and 2 million Republicans, including 21,716 blacks.   Cross-over voting is not permitted.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
