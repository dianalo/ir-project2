The vessel ``is simply a cruise ship and has nothing to do withany treasure-hunting whatsoever,'' embassy spokesman HarryTrouerbach said in a telephone interview.   Earlier reports in Europe said the ship was carrying treasurehunters in search of a World War II wreck.   ``That is a fantastic story. It surely comes from a veryimaginative mind,'' Trouerbach said.   The Plancius was released Friday afternoon and was bound for theneighboring Netherlands Antilles island of Curacao, Trouerbach saidlate Friday.   The Venezuelan coast guard detained the ship a week agp off LaBlanquilla island, 170 miles northeast of Caracas. Venezuelaclaimed it had illegaly entered its territorial waters.   Trouerbach said it was allowed to leave La Guaira port atCaracas once authorities determined it never actually enteredVenezuelan waters.   The Plancius was taking its 40 passengers to Willemstad,Curacao's main city, where they were scheduled to board a KLM planefor the Netherlands, Trouerbach said.   ``Most of the passengers are biologists, not treasure-hunters,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
