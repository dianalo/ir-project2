(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A young computer whiz who tried to commitsuicide after creditors and authorities seized his company has beencharged with bilking six investors out of more than $500,000 tokeep his business operating.   A Nofolk County grand jury handed up an indictment Tuesdayagainst 24-year-old Tex Zachary Hildreth, charging him with 11counts of felony larceny.   He was scheduled to be arraigned today in Norfolk SuperiorCourt. His attorney did not return telephone calls after businesshours Tuesday.   Hildreth, who started his computer software firm at age 20 andlived lavishly, orchestrated ``financial deals where he promisedinvestors substantial returns,'' said Mike McGorty, a spokesman forthe county district attorney.   ``The money is still outstanding,'' the spokesman said. ``This(fraud) could stretch well beyond a million dollars.''   Some of the money was solicited to pay off other investors andbank notes, said McGorty.   Hildreth also is charged with using falsified documents toobtain bank loans for his Braintree-based company, Massdata Corp.,McGorty said.   ``Why he was doing it is something that remains to come out.This is a very long and careful investigation and it continues,''he said.   The grand jury heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses overtwo months, McGorty said.   Each of the 11 counts carries a maximum penalty of five years inprison or a $25,000 fine and two years in prison, McGorty said.   Hildreth and his mother, Rose, 50, fled Massachusetts justbefore his company was closed in May and its assets seized.   They were found a short time later when an employee at a NewHampshire hotel called police to report a bloodied man wandering inthe lobby. Police found Hildreth, who apparently had slashed hiswrists. His mother, a former school lunchroom worker who wasemployed by Massdata as a clerk, was found lying injured in theirroom. Both were incoherent, police said.   In the room, authorities found what they believed were suicidenotes, said Manchester, N.H., police Lt. William Bovaird.   Hildreth, who had been charged with larceny of more than $250after police received a complaint about his business dealings, wasarrested as a fugitive.   He bought his first computer at age 16 and, with the help of amentor, rented office space to start his own software firm at age20. The confidence he gained prompted the overweight young man tolose 115 pounds in less than two years.   He quickly surrounded himself with symbols of success, includinga $220,000 condominium, a $32,000 BMW and a $4,000, 50-inch TV.</TEXT></DOC>
