The official Xinhua News Agency reported the project, but aforeign commerical official said it was highly uncertain it would becarried out.   Xinhua said $250 million is to be invested in Panda Motors Corp.in Huizhou, a small city east of the Guangdong provincial capital ofCanton and 54 miles from a nearby port to Hong Kong.   The China News Service, another official agency, said the firststage of the project will be finished by 1995, but that the firstcars will be produced as early as next year. All the vehicles willbe exported, it said.   It said Huizhou city was preparing to borrow $54 million to buildpower generating plants, docks and other facilities needed for thefactory.   The official reports did not identify the foreign investors.   A foreign commercial official in Canton said one of the mainbackers was Dr. Charles Kim, a Korean-American who formerly workedfor the Small Business Administration in Washington. The company'shome office is in Arlington, Va.   The official said the company was incorporated in Delaware inSeptember 1988 and former Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada waslisted as a legal adviser, but that little was known about who wasbehind the project or how much of the project they were financing.Officials of the company reached in Huizhou referred all questionsto the home office in Virginia.   The commercial official said it did not appear that any majorAmerican or Japanese automaker was involved in the project. He saidSouth Korea, which has shown an interest in expanding its investmentin China, has also denied putting money in Huizhou.   ``The whole premise is very, very iffy,'' said the official,speaking on condition of anonymity. He referred to the difficulty ofobtaining quality parts in China and the question of whether thereis an international market for 300,000 vehicles made in China.   The commercial official noted that top leaders in Beijingapproved the decision before the June military crackdown on thestudent protest movement and the ouster of Communist Party chiefZhao Ziyang and other reformists.   ``Unfortunately the top is no longer there,'' he said, adding itis not certain the current conservative leadership will let theproject proceed.   The project also runs counter to attempts to consolidate China'sslumping auto industry and bring it under the control of centralplanners in Beijing.   The State Council, or cabinet, late last year announced it willno longer approve joint ventures involving cars and that passengercar production will be confined to six major manufacturers.   They include the First Automotive Works in northern Jilin, whichis making Audis in cooperation with Volkswagen; the SecondAutomotive Works in central Hubei province; the Japan-backed TianjinAutomotive Industry Corp.; the Shanghai Volkswagen Auto Co.; theBeijing Jeep Corp., a Chrysler subsidiary; and the Guangzhou PeugeotAutomobile Co.   Chinese auto officials say they want to produce up to 700,000passenger cars by the year 2000; only 33,000 were made last year outof total vehicle production of about 560,000.   In the first half of 1989, China produced 290,000 vehicles,including 37,800 passenger cars. But a tough government austerityplan, including a ban on most public institutions buying cars, hasled to plummeting sales and huge inventories.</TEXT></DOC>
