BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)EXECUTIVE (EXE)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Automatic budget cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law would slice military programs by 10.4% and nonmilitary programs by 8.7%, the non-partisan Congessional Budget Office estimated.    Budget reductions of about that size will take effect Nov. 20 if Congress and the president fail to compromise on their own deficit-reduction package. And yesterday, President Reagan again signaled his intention to oppose the deficit-reduction plan currently moving through Congress, which would contain a tax increase.    Gramm-Rudman, which was recently revitalized by Congress and the president, would make across-the-board cuts of $23 billion from projected levels of government spending for the year that began Oct. 1. The budget office's new estimate for the deficit in fiscal 1988 is $179.3 billion before cuts, $9.4 billion higher than its previous projection.    &quot;The CBO report could be the start of the countdown to a major embarrassment -- automatic sequester (budget cuts),&quot; said Lawton Chiles (D., Fla.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. &quot;Or it can mark the opening of the hunting season, where Congress and the White House work together to find the savings necessary to reduce the deficit in a responsible way.&quot;    President Reagan made clear that raising taxes isn't an alternative he will back. &quot;It's possible to meet the deficit-reduction targets with no new taxes,&quot; he said. &quot;If Congress should actually pass a tax hike -- my answer will be simply this: veto.&quot;    One possibility being voiced by many lawmakers is that the president will accept a watered-down version of Congress's deficit-reduction plan, leading to use of only part of the across-the-board cuts the Congressional Budget Office report outlined yesterday.    The budget office estimate isn't the final word on the amount of cuts that would go into effect. Estimates by the White House's Office of Management and Budget also are considered. But Edwin Dale, its spokesman, said those projections, due out Tuesday, will be similar to the congressional estimates.    The automatic cuts would be taken equally from military and nonmilitary spending. Military personnel would be exempted from the automatic cuts. Also, among nonmilitary spending, several poverty programs and Social Security would be exempted from automatic curtailment.    According to the budget office, the cuts are concentrated in about 20% of government spending. If the full $23 billion in automatic cuts go into effect, the Pentagon would have a budget of $278.9 billion, $5 billion less than the lowest level envisioned by Congress's budget resolution and about $2 billion less than its fiscal 1987 outlays.    Nonmilitary spending would be sliced to $774.2 billion, $5.2 billion less than Congress has resolved but $40 billion more than last year's estimated spending.    The Gramm-Rudman cuts are made from projected levels that take inflation into account. </TEXT></DOC>
