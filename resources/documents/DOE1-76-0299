<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0299 </DOCNO><TEXT>In 1979 the authors showed that the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus ison chromosome 14, and in 1981 they showed that the locus for the lambdalight chain is on chromosome 22. On the basis of these findings the authorsspeculated that the genes for human immunoglobulin chains could be directlyinvolved in the rearrangements observed in Burkitt lymphomas and in thepathogenesis of this disease. The subsequent finding that the locus forimmunoglobulin kappa chains maps at chromosome band 2q11 strengthenedthis speculation. Therefore, they have used somatic cell genetic techniquesto determine whether the chromosome breakpoints in Burkitt lymphoma withthe t chromosome translocation involve directly the heavy chain locus.The results of this analysis are summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
