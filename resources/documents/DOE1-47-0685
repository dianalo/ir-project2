Optical control of diffusedischarges is a promising way of upgrading the performance of e-beamcontrolled opening switches for repetitive operation. Ideal gases shouldexhibit a negligible attachment cross section for low E/N values (switchclosed) in the ground state and strong attaching properties upon opticalexcitation in an E/N range between the conducting state and self breakdownof the switch. The ratio of resistivity change in these experiments ismuch higher than in previous investigations. In this investigation theattachment rate of an electronegative gas component, representing approximately1% of the gas in the discharge volume, was increased by means of vibrationalexcitation with a pulsed IR-laser beam. Molecules exhibiting a stronglyincreased attachment rate upon IR-excitation are vinyl-chloride, vinylflouride and trifluoroethylene, which has been verified in preliminaryexperiments. All experiments reported were performed with vinyl chlorideand trifluoroethylene.</TEXT></DOC>
