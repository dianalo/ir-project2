L. No. 99-570,100 Stat. 3207-49. In addition, there are many editorial revisions andchanges to the existing DOE rule on FOIA which are incorporated in thisfinal rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Information</ITAG>The Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, 100Stat. 3207-49, requires that each agency (1) promulgate regulations whichestablish a fee schedule to process requests for information and (2) establishprocedures and guidelines to determine when such fees should be waivedor reduced. The DOE fee schedule and procedures conform to the guidelinesissued by the OMB for agencies to follow in implementing these regulations.This final rule revises existing DOE fee schedules and procedures in accordancewith the FOIA, as amended, and makes other technical and editorial changesto the DOE regulations that implement the FOIA. The DOE published its proposedrule for comment on June 17, 1987 (52 FR 23155).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order No. 12291</ITAG>It has been determined that these regulations are not a major rule subjectto the requirements of Executive Order No. 12291 (46 FR 13193, February19, 1981), because they are not likely to result in an annual effect onthe economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local Governmentagencies, or geographic regions, or cause significant adverse effect oncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the abilityof United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.These regulations were submitted to the Director of the Office of Managementand Budget for a 10 day review period as required by section 3(c)(3) ofExecutive Order No. 12291. The Director has concluded his review underthat Executive Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>Comments postmarked or received within the comment period were consideredin the development of this final rule. In response to a suggestion by theecommenters, the DOE will again include the language of the FOIA exemptionsin the rule. Additional comments are addressed below according to the subsectionsof the regulation to which they apply.1. <T3>Definitions (Section 1004.2).</T3> Three commenters objected to certaindefinitions contained in this section, especially that of ``representativeof the news media.'' However, these definitions were drawn from the OMBFee Guidelines, that became final after a period of public notice and commentin which concerns similar to those raised by these commenters were considered.<T3>See</T3> OMB Fee Guidelines, sec. 6g-6j, 52 FR 10011, 10017-18 (March27, 1987); <T3>see also</T3> 52 FR 10013-15 (OMB analysis of comments on definitions).The DOE is required by the FOIA to conform its fee schedule, which includesthese definitions of categories of requesters, to the OMB Fee Guidelines.Furthermore, the DOE firmly believes that these definitions, includingthat of ``representative of the news media,'' properly implement the statutoryintent of the amended Act.2. <T3>Fees to be charged (Section 1004.9(a)).</T3> One commenter objectedto the use of private sector firms to locate, reproduce and disseminaterecords in response to FOIA requests, because these private firms mighthave access to trade secrets and confidential commercial information. However,this provision was taken directly from the OMB Fee Guidelines. <T3>See</T3> OMB Fee Guidelines, sec. 7, 52 FR 10011, 10018 (March 27,1987). The DOE believes that this correctly implements the statutory provisionconcerning making records promptly available.3. <T3>Review of records (Section 1004.9(a)(3)).</T3> One commenter objectedto the provision for charging review costs for a subsequent review of recordspreviously withheld pursuant to an exemption determined to no longer apply.The DOE believes that such review qualifies under the statute as an ``initialexamination'' because the record is being reviewed for the first time todetermine whether other exemptions which had not been previously considerednow apply. If these review costs were precluded, the DOE would be compelledat the time of initial processing to review these records to determinethe applicability of all possible exemptions, even though at the time ofprocessing one exemption may clearly apply to the entire record or portionsthereof. Such an approach would unnecessarily increase review costs torequesters.4. <T3>Notification of charges (Section 1004.9(a)(7)).</T3> One commenterstated that it is unclear whether a requester must agree to pay all feesfor charges over $25.00 before the time deadlines for a response to hisrequest will begin to run. A sentence has been added to this section ofthe final rule to address this concern and to clarify that under thesecircumstances, a request is deemed to have been received when the requesterhas provided an assurance to pay the total anticipated fee. Such an assuranceensures that government expenses are not inappropriately incurred and arecovery of cost can be made.5. <T3>Waiving or reducing fees (Section 1004.9(a)(8)). </T3>Three commentersexpressed concern that the factors to be considered for fee waivers andfee reductions require the DOE to make speculative and subjective valuejudgments regarding the subject of a request and its value to the public.These factors set forth by the DOE, are taken directly from the statute.The six criteria enumerated in the regulation are provided as specificelements to be considered that shall be known to all requesters. The DOEwill make every effort to apply the criteria in an objective manner.Contrary to the suggestion of two of the commenters, the requirement thatinformation be submitted in support of a fee waiver request is not affectedby the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq. </T3>The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of theOMB, which has responsibility for the implementation of the Paperwork ReductionAct, has determined that FOIA fee regulation requirements that requesterssubmit information in support of their fee waiver and fee limitation claimsare not ``information collection requests'' within the meaning of thatAct. <T3>See also </T3>5 CFR 1320.7(c) (1987).One commenter also urged that the DOE establish certain categories of requestersor types of requests which would be presumptively entitled to a fee waiver.The DOE believes that each request for a fee waiver must be evaluated onits own merit and that the provisions of andSection; 1004.9(a)(8) accuratelyreflect the appropriate considerations guiding agency fee waiver determinations.The fee waiver provision of the FOIA, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(iii),does not provide for any such presumptions for categories of requesters,although the limitations on duplication, search, and review fees undersubsection (a)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act do distinguish among categories ofrequesters. The fee waiver provision in subsection (a)(4)(A)(iii), therefore,must be applied on a case-by-case basis for all requesters.6. <T3>Charges for unsuccessful search (Section 1004.9(b)(6)). </T3>One commenterobjected to the provision for charging requesters for unsuccessful searches,asserting that this might intimidate potential requesters. The statute,however, does not restrict recovery of search costs to those instanceswhere documents are located. <T3>See </T3>5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Since costs will be incurred bythe DOE regardless of whether a search results in the discovery of responsiverecords, the DOE believes that the requester should incur this expenseand not the general public.7. <T3>Aggregating requests (Section 1004.9(b)(7)). </T3>One commenter questionedthe language of this section stating that it is unclear that the DOE willapply a reasonable standard to determine whether a request is being brokendown to evade fees. The word ``reasonably'' has been added to the languagefor clarification.The commenter also suggested that DOE include in the final rule the statementthat in no case will DOE aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjectsfrom one requester. This comment has been adopted and the rule has beenrevised accordingly.8. <T3>Advance payments (Section 1004.9(b)(8)). </T3>Two commenters objectedto the suspension of the statutory time limits for responding to a requestwhile an advance payment is being sought. However, this provision ensuresthat the agency recoup appropriate costs incurred to provide a requesterthe documents sought. Moreover, this provision is consistent with the OMBFee Guidelines. <T3>See </T3>OMB Fee Guidelines, sec. 9d, 52 FR 10011, 10020 (March 27,1987).The DOE believes that this provision correctly implements the statutoryprovision concerning advance payments.9. <T3>Handling information of a private business, foreign government, oran international organization (Section 1004.11). </T3>One commenter statedthat ``the regulations should make clear that the provisions for consultingwith businesses and others may not be exercised in a manner that will interferewith the agency's obligation to grant or deny information within 10 days.''As written, the DOE regulations have no adverse impact on the Department'sresponsibility to determine within 10 days after the receipt of a requestwhether to comply with the request. This determination may precede andis independent of any consultation with submitters of information coveredby this section.Additionally, one commenter suggested the addition of some safeguards forhandling information covered by this section. As written, this sectionis no different than that which existed previously in the FOIA regulationsof the Department, and the DOE has determined that adequate safeguardswere contained therein.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 1004</ITAG>Freedom of information.<ITAG tagnum="6">Harry L.

L. 89-487, as amended by Pub. L. 93-502, 88Stat. 1561, by Pub. L. 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241, and by Pub. L. 99-570, 100Stat. 3207-49. The regulations of this part provide information concerningthe procedures by which records may be requested from all DOE offices,excluding the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Records of theDOE made available pursuant to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 shall befurnished to members of the public as prescribed by this part. Personsseeking information or records of the DOE may find it helpful to consultwith a DOE Freedom of Information Officer before invoking the formal proceduresset out below. To the extent permitted by other laws, the DOE will makerecords available which it is authorized to withhold under 5 U.S.C. 552whenever it determines that such disclosure is in the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1004.2  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.  </ITAG>As used in this part:  (a) ``Appeal Authority'' means the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  (b) ``Authorizing or Denying Official'' means that DOE officer as identifiedby the Directorate of Administration by separate directive, having custodyof or responsibility for records requested under 5 U.S.C. 552.

(c) ```Commercial use' request'' refers to a request from or on behalfof one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial,trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalfthe request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongsin this category, agencies must determine how the requester will use thedocuments requested. Moreover, where DOE has reasonable cause to doubtthe use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where thatuse is not evident from the request itself, the DOE will seek additionalclarification before assigning the request to a specific category.  (d) ``Department'' or ``Department of Energy (DOE)'' means all organizationalentities which are a part of the executive department created by TitleII of the DOE Organization Act, Pub L. 95-91. This specifically excludesthe FERC.  (e) ``Direct costs'' means those expenditures which the DOE actually incursin searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters,reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include,for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basicrate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits)and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in directcosts are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lightingthe facility in which the records are stored.  (f) ``Duplication'' refers to the process of making a copy of a documentnecessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of,but are not limited to, paper copy, microform, audiovisual materials, ormachine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk). The copyprovided must be in a form that can be reasonably used by requesters. (g) ``Educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a public or privateelementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education,an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professionaleducation, and an institution of vocational education, which operates aprogram or programs of scholarly research.

Box 3402, Golden, CO 80401.(i) ``General Counsel'' means the General Counsel provided for in section202(b) of the DOE Organization Act, or any DOE attorney designated by theGeneral Counsel as having responsibility for counseling the Departmenton Freedom of Information Act matters.(j) ``Headquarters'' means all DOE facilities functioning within the Washingtonmetropolitan area.(k) ``Non-commercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referencedin andSection; 1004.2(c), and which is operated solely for the purpose ofconducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended topromote any particular product or industry.(l) ``Office'' means any administrative or operating unit of the DOE, includingthose in field offices.(m) ``Representative of the news media'' refers to any person activelygathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publishor broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information thatis about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcastingto the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in thoseinstances when they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who maketheir products available for purchase or subscription by the general public.These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive.Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronicdissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), suchalternative media would be included in this category. In the case of ``freelance''journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization ifthey can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through thatorganization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contractwould be the clearest proof, but agencies may also look to the past publicationrecord of a requester in making this determination.(n) ``Review'' refers to the process of examining documents located inresponse to a commercial use request (see andSection; 1004.2(c)) to determinewhether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld.It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing allthat is necessary to excise them and otherwise pepare them for release.Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issuesregarding the application of exemptions.(o) ``Search'' includes all time spent looking for material that is responsiveto a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification ofmaterial within documents. The DOE will search for material in the mostefficient and least expensive manner in order to minimize cost for bothDOE and the requester. For example, DOE will not engage in line-by-linesearch when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the lessexpensive and quicker method of complying with a request. ``Search'' willbe distinguished, moreover, from ``review'' of material in order to determinewhether the material is exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manuallyor by computer using existing programming.(p) ``Secretarial Officer'' means the General Counsel; Assistant Secretary,Management and Administration; Assistant Secretary for Congressional, Intergovernmental,and Public Affairs; Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and EnergyEmergencies; Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy; Assistant Secretaryfor Fossil Energy; Assistant Secretary, Conservation and Renewable Energy;Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs; Assistant Secretary for Environment,Safety, and Health; Administrator, Economic Regulatory Administration;Administrator, Energy Information Administration; Director of Energy Research;Director of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management; Director of MinorityEconomic Impact, and the Inspector General.(q) ``Statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees forparticular types of records,'' at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi), means anystatute that specifically requires a government agency, such as the GovernmentPrinting Office (GPO) or the National Technical Information Service (NTIS),to set the level of fees for particular types of records, in order to:(1) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations by convenientlymaking available government information;(2) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications andother services which are for their special use so that these costs arenot borne by the general taxpaying public;(3) Operate an information dissemination activity on a self-sustainingbasis to the maximum extent possible; or(4) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, appropriatedfunds used to pay the cost of disseminating government information.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1004.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Public reading facilities.</ITAG>(a) The DOE Headquarters will maintain, in the public reading facilities,the materials which are required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to be made availablefor public inspection and copying. The principal public reading facilitywill be located at the Freedom of Information Office, 1000 IndependenceAvenue, SW, Washington, DC. A complete listing of other facilities is availablefrom the Freedom of Information Officer at DOE Headquarters.(b) Each of the designated field offices will maintain in public readingfacilities certain materials maintained in the Headquarters facility andother materials associated with the particular field offices.(c) Each of these public reading facilities will maintain and make availablefor public inspection and copying current indices of the materials at thatfacility which are required to be indexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) or otherapplicable statutes.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1004.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Elements of a request.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Addressed to the Freedom of Information Officer.</T3> A request fora record of the DOE which is not available in a public reading facility,as described in andSection; 1004.3, shall be addressed to the appropriateHeadquarters or field Freedom of Information Officer, Department of Energy,at a location listed in andSection; 1004.2(h) of this part, and both theenvelope and the letter shall be clearly marked ``Freedom of InformationRequest.'' Except as provided in andSection; 1004.4(e), a request will beconsidered to be received by the DOE for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)upon actual receipt by the Freedom of Information Officer. Requests deliveredafter regular business hours of the Freedom of Information Office are consideredreceived on the next regular business day.(b) <T3>Request must be in writing and for reasonably described records. </T3>Arequest for access to records must be submitted in writing and must reasonablydescribe the records requested to enable DOE personnel to locate them witha reasonable amount of effort. Where possible, specific information regardingdates, titles, file designations, and other information which may helpidentify the records should be supplied by the requester, including thenames and titles of any DOE officers or employees who have been contactedregarding the request prior to the submission of a written request. Ifthe request relates to a matter in pending litigation, the court and itslocation should be identified to aid in locating the documents. If therecords are known to be in a particular office of the DOE, the requestshould identify that office.  (c) <T3>Categorial requests. </T3>(1) Must meet reasonably described recordsrequirement. A request for all records falling within a reasonably specificand well-defined category shall be regarded as conforming to the statutoryrequirement that records be reasonably described if DOE personnel can reasonablydetermine which particular records are sought in the request. The requestmust enable the DOE to identify an locate the records sought by a processthat is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive of DOE operations. TheFreedom of Information Officer may take into consideration problems ofsearch which are associated with the files of an individual office withinthe Department and determine that a request is not one for reasonably describeddocuments as it pertains to that office.  (2) Assistance in reformulating a non-conforming request. If a requestdoes not reasonably describe the records sought, as specified in paragraph(c)(1) of this section, the DOE response will specify the reasons why therequest failed to meet the requiremnts of paragraph (c)(1) of this sectionand will invite the requester to confer with knowledgeable DOE personnelin an attempt to restate the request or reduce the request to managableproportions by reformulation or by agreeing on an orderly procedure forthe production of the records. If DOE responds that additional informationis needed from the requester to render records reasonably described, anyreformulated request submitted by the requester will be treated as an initialrequest for purposes of calculating the time for DOE response.  (d) <T3>Nonexistent records. </T3>(1) 5 U.S.C. 552 does not require the compilationor creation of a record for the purpose of satisfying a request for records. (2) 5 U.S.C. 552 does not require the DOE to honor a request for a recordnot yet in existence, even where such a document may be expected to comeinto existence at a later time.  (3) If a requested record is known to have been destroyed or otherwisedisposed of, or if no such record is known to exist, the requester willbe so notified.  (e) <T3>Assurance of willingness to pay fees. </T3>A request shall include(1) an assurance to pay whatever fees will be assessed in accordance withandSection;1004.9, (2) an assurance to pay those fees not exceeding somespecified dollar amount, or (3) a request for a waiver or reduction offees. No request will be deemed to have been received until the DOE hasreceived some valid assurance of willingness to bear fees anticipated tobe associated with the processing of the request or a specific requestof a waiver or reduction of fees.  (f) <T3>Requests for records or information of other agencies. </T3>Some ofthe records in the files of the DOE have been obtained from other Federalagencies or contain information obtained from other Federal agencies. (1) Where a document originated in another Federal agency, the AuthorizingOfficial will refer the request to the originating agency and so informthe requester, unless the originator agrees to direct release by DOE. (2) Requests for DOE records containing information received from anotheragency, or records prepared jointly by DOE and other agencies, will betreated as requests for DOE records except that the Authorizing Officialwill coordinate with the appropriate official of the other agency. Thenotice of determinaton to the requester, in the event part or all of therecord is recommended for denial by the other agency, will cite the otheragency Denying Official as well as the appropriate DOE Denying Officialif a denial by DOE is also involved.       <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1004.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Processing requests for records.</ITAG>(a) Freedom of Information Officers will be responsible for processingrequests for records submitted pursuant to this part. Upon receiving sucha request, the Freedom of Information Officer will, except as providedin paragraph (c) of this section, ascertain which Authorizing Officialhas responsibility for, custody of, or concern with the records requested.The Freedom of Information Officer will review the request, consultingwith the Authorizing Official where appropriate, to determine its compliancewith andSection; 1004.4. Where a request complies with andSection; 1004.4,the Freedom of Information Officer will acknowledge receipt of the requestto the requester and forward the request to the Authorizing Official foraction.(b) The Authorizing Official will promptly identify and review the recordsencompassed by the request. The Authorizing Official will prepare a writtenresponse (1) granting the request, (2) denying the request, (3) granting/denyingit in part, (4) replying with a response stating that the request has beenreferred to another agency under andSection; 1004.4(f) or andSection; 1004.6(e),(5) informing the requester that responsive records cannot be located ordo not exist.(c) Where a request involves records which are in the custody of or arethe concern of more than one Authorizing Official, the Freedom of InformationOfficer will identify all concerned Authorizing Officials, send copiesof the request to them and forward the request for action to the AuthorizingOfficial that can reasonably be expected to have custody of most of therequested records. This Authorizing Official will prepare a DOE responseto the requester consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, which willidentify any other Authorizing Official, having responsibility for thedenial of records.(d) Time for processing requests.

The DOE will use the most efficient andleast costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under theFOIA. The DOE may contract with private sector services to locate, reproduceand disseminate records in response to FOIA requests when that is the mostefficient and least costly method. When doing so, however, the DOE willensure that the ultimate cost to the requester is no greater than it wouldbe if the DOE itself had performed these tasks. In no case will the DOEcontract out responsibilities which the FOIA provides that only the agencymay discharge, such as determining the applicability of an exemption, ordetermining whether to waive or reduce fees. Where the DOE can identifydocuments that are responsive to a request and are maintained for publicdistribution by other agencies such as the National Technical InformationService and the Government Printing Office, the Freedom of InformationOfficer will inform requesters of the procedures to obtain records fromthose sources.(1) <T3>Manual searches for records. </T3>Whenever feasible, the DOE will chargefor manual searches for records at the salary rate(s) (i.e. basic pay plus16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search.(2) <T3>Computer searches for records. </T3>The DOE will charge at the actualdirect cost of providing the service. This will include the cost of operatingthe central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of operating time thatis directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a FOIArequest and operator/programmer salary.(3) <T3>Review of records. </T3>The DOE will charge requesters who are seekingdocuments for commercial use for time spent reviewing records to determinewhether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges will be assessedonly for the initial review (i.e., the review undertaken the first timethe DOE analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particularrecord or portion of a record. The DOE will not charge for review at theadministrative appeal level of an exemption already applied. However, recordsor portions of records withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequentlydetermined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicabilityof other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequentreview would be properly assessable.(4) <T3>Duplication of records. </T3>The DOE will make a per-page charge forpaper copy reproduction of documents. At present, the charge for paperto paper copies will be five cents per page and the charge for microformto paper copies will be ten cents per page. For computer generated copies,such as tapes or printouts, the DOE will charge the actual cost, includingoperator time, for production of the tape or printout. For other methodsof reproduction or duplication, we will charge the actual direct costsof producing the document(s).(5) <T3>Other charges. </T3>It shall be noted that complying with requestsfor special services such as those listed below is entirely at the discretionof this agency. Neither the FOIA nor its fee structure cover these kindsof services. The DOE will recover the full direct costs of providing servicessuch as those enumerated below to the extent that we elect to provide them:(i) Certifying that records are true copies;(ii) Sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc.(6) <T3>Restrictions on assessing fees. </T3>With the exception of requestersseeking documents for a commercial use, section (a)(4)(A)(iv) of the Freedomof Information Act, as amended, DOE will provide the first 100 pages ofduplication and the first two hours of search time without charge. Moreover,DOE will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters,if the cost of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than thefee itself. These provisions work together, so that except for commercialuse requesters, DOE will not begin to assess fees until after the Departmenthas provided the free search and reproduction. For example, if a requestinvolves two hours and ten minutes of search time and results in 105 pagesof documents, DOE will charge for only 10 minutes of search time and onlyfive pages of reproduction. If this cost is equal to or less than $15.00,the amount DOE incurs to process a fee collection, no charges would beassessed. For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, theword ``pages'' refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which willbe normally be ``8\1/2\andmultiply;11'' or ``11andmultiply;14.'' Thus, requesterswould not be entitled to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks, for example.A microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or 100 pages of computerprintout, however, might meet the terms of the restriction. Similarly,the term ``search time'' is based on a <T3>manual search. </T3>To apply this term to searches made by computer,the DOE will determine the hourly cost of operating the central processingunit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent. When the cost ofthe search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computerto process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hoursof the salary of the computer operator conducting the search, DOE willbegin assessing charges for computer search.(7) <T3>Notification of charges. </T3>If the DOE determines or estimates thatthe fees to be assessed under this section may amount to more than $25.00,the requester will be informed of the estimated amount of fees, unlessthe requester has previously indicated a willingness to pay the amountestimated by the agency. In cases where a requester has been notified thatactual or estimated fees may amount to more than $25.00, the request willbe deemed not to have been received until the requester has agreed to paythe anticipated total fee. A notice to a requester pursuant to this paragraphwill offer him the opportunity to confer with DOE personnel in order toreformulate his request to meet his needs at a lower cost.(8) <T3>Waiving or reducing fees. </T3>The DOE will furnish documents withoutcharge or at reduced charges if disclosure of the information is in thepublic interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to publicunderstanding of the operations or activities of the government and disclosureis not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. This feewaiver standard thus sets forth two basic requirements, both of which mustbe satisfied before fees will be waived or reduced. First it must be establishedthat disclosure of the requested information is in the public interestbecause it is likely to contribute significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the government. Second, it must be establishedthat disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interestof the requester. When these requirements are satisfied, based upon informationsupplied by a requester or otherwise made known to the DOE, the waiveror reduction of a FOIA fee will be granted. In determining when fees shouldbe waived or reduced the Freedom of Information Officer should addressthe following two criteria:(i) That disclosure of the Information ``is in the Public Interest Becauseit is Likely to Contribute Significantly to Public Understanding of theOperations or Activities of the Government.'' Factors to be consideredin applying this criteria include but are not limited to:(A) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested recordsconcerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';(B) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether thedisclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding of governmentoperations or activities;(C) The contribution to an understanding by the general public of the subjectlikely to result from disclosure; and(D) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whetherthe disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public understandingof government operations or activities.(ii) If Disclosure of the Information ``is Not Primarily in the CommercialInterest of the Requester.'' Factors to be considered in applying thiscriteria include but are not limited to:(A) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requesterhas a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure;and, if so(B) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identifiedcommercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparisonwith the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is ``primarilyin the commercial interest of the requester.''(b) <T3>Fees to be charged_categories of requesters. </T3>There are four categoriesof FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercialscientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all otherrequesters. The Freedom of Information Officer will make determinationsregarding categories of requesters as defined at andSection; 1004.2. TheHeadquarters Freedom of Information Officer will assist field Freedom ofInformation Officers in categorizing requesters, and will resolve conflictingcategorizations. The FOIA prescribes specific levels of fees for each ofthese categories:(1) <T3>Commercial use requesters. </T3>When the DOE receives a request fordocuments which appears to be for commercial use, charges will be assessedto recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release,and duplicating the records sought. Commerical use requesters are not entitledto two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction ofdocuments. The DOE will recover the cost of searching for and reviewingrecords even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records.(2) <T3>Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters. </T3>TheDOE will provide documents to requesters in this category for the costof reproduction only, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To beeligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that therequest is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifyinginstitution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, butare sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educationalinstitution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientificinstitution) research.(3) <T3>Requesters who are representatives of the news media</T3>. The DOEwill provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproductiononly, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusionin this category, a requester must meet the criteria in andSection; 1004.2(m),and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. With respectto this class of requesters, a request for records supporting the newsdissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be arequest for a commercial use.(4) <T3>All other requesters</T3>. The DOE will charge requesters who do notfall into any of the above categories fees which recover the full reasonabledirect cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsiveto the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and thefirst two hours of search time will be furnished without charge. Moreover,requests from individuals for records about themselves filed in DOE systemsof records will continue to be processed under the fee provisions of thePrivacy Act of 1974.(5) <T3>Charging interest_notice and rate.</T3> Interest will be charged thoserequesters who fail to pay fees. The DOE will begin to assess interestcharges on the amount billed on the 31st day following the day on whichthe billing was sent to the requester. Interest will be at the rate prescribedin section 3717 of Title 31 U.S.C. and will accrue from the date of thebilling.(6) <T3>Charges for unsuccessful search</T3>. The DOE will assess charges fortime spent searching even if the search fails to identify responsive recordsor if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If theDOE estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it will notifythe requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester hasindicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated.Such a notice will offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agencypersonnel in order to reformulate the request to reduce the cost of therequest.(7) <T3>Aggregating requests</T3>. A requester may not file multiple requestseach seeking portions of a document or documents, solely to avoid paymentof fees. When the DOE reasonably believes that a requester or, a groupof requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request downinto a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment offees, the DOE will aggregate any such requests and charge the appropriatefees. The DOE may consider the time period in which the requests have beenmade in its determination to aggregate the related requests. In no casewill DOE aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.(8) <T3>Advance payments</T3>. Requesters are not required to make an advancepayment (i.e., payment before action is commenced or continued on a request)unless:(i) The DOE estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requestermay be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00. In such cases, theDOE will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain a satisfactoryassurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt paymentof FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the fullestimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment.(ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion(i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing). The DOE will requirethe requester to pay the full amount delinquent plus any applicable interestas provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, or demonstrate that hehas, in fact, paid the delinquent fee; and to make an advance payment ofthe full amount of the estimated current fee before we begin to processa new request or a pending request from that requester.When the DOE acts under paragraphs (b)(8) (i) or (ii) of this section,the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA(i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 workingdays from receipt of appeals from initial denials, plus permissible extensionsof these time limits) will begin only after the DOE has received fee paymentsdescribed above.(c) <T3>Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365)</T3>. TheDOE will use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosureto consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, whereappropriate, to encourage payment of fees.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1004.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemptions.</ITAG>(a) 5 U.S.C. 552 exempts from all of its publication and disclosure requirementsnine categories of records which are described in paragraph (b) of thatsection.
