Notice No. 88-5 included a brief statement concerning each proposaland invited public comment. The interested reader is referred to NoticeNo. 88-5 for additional background information. Twenty-three commenters responded to Notice No. 88-5. While a number ofcommenters expressed support for various proposals and offered suggestionsfor specific changes, several commenters expressed their opposition tocertain proposals. Listed below is a section-by-section summary of thechanges and a discussion of comments received. <ITAG tagnum="84">A. Part 171 </ITAG>In andSection; 171.7, the following changes are made: 1. In paragraph (c)(4), the address for the Bureau of Explosives, Associationof American Railroads (AAR) is revised; 2. Paragraph (c)(5), containing an outdated address for AAR is updated;3. In paragraph (c)(19), the current address for The Fertilizer Instituteis revised; 4. Paragraph (d)(2) is amended by updating the AAR Specification for TankCars from the 1985 edition to the 1988 edition; 5. Paragraph (d)(7)(iv) is amended by revising the title of a Bureau ofExplosives' publication; and 6. Paragraph (d)(17) is amended by updating the International MaritimeDangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) to the latest 1988 edition. 7. Paragraph (d)(33) is added to reference The Fertilizer Institute's publication.``Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer'', datedAugust 1984. References to the 1971 edition of this publication which appearedin andSection;andSection; 173.182 and 174.510 are removed. In andSection; 171.8, the definition for ``Atmospheric gases'' is amendedto include ``air.'' Also, the gas ``argon'' was inadvertently omitted fromthe definition in the notice. This oversight is corrected. In andSection; 171.12. the last sentence of paragraph (b) and the penultimatesentence in paragraph (d) are revised to allow stowage and segregationof hazardous materials in freight containers in conformance with the requirementsof the IMDG Code, when transported by motor vehicle or railcar. These changesare made for consistency with a similar change made to andSection; 176.11in this final rule, concerning transportation by vessel. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Part 172 </ITAG>In andSection; 172.101. the Hazardous Materials Table is amended as follows:1. The entry ``1,1-Difluoroethylene <T3>(R-1132A)</T3>'' is added. The appropriate refrigerant ``R'' numberis added for consistency with other refrigerant gas entries appearing inthe Table, as suggested by a commenter. 2. The entry ``Empty cartridge case, primed'' is removed. 3. The hazard class for ``Hydrogen selenide'' is changed from ``Flammablegas'' to ``Poison A'' and a restriction regarding stowage on a vessel isadded in Column 7(c). 4. The entry ``Life rafts, inflatable'' is revised to read``Life-savingappliances, self-inflating'' with the identification number ``UN 2990,''for consistency with the description in international regulations for transportationby aircraft. 5. The prefix ``NA'' for the entry ``Paint related material'' is revisedto read ``UN'' 1263, for consistency with the international regulations.This change was proposed in Docket HM-181. 6. The entry for ``Sulfur, molten'' is revised to provide for an alternativespelling of the description as ``Sulphur, molten''. 7. A cross reference, ``Perchloroethylene <T3>see </T3>Tetrachloroethylene'' is added to clarify that either namemay be used as a proper shipping name. ``Perchloroethylene'' is commonlyused domestically, and ``Tetrachloroethylene'' is used internationally.8. The italicized entry ``<T3>Tetraethylammonium perchlorate (dry)</T3>'' with the word ``forbidden''is removed. A new entry is added to allow shipment of the material as aflammable solid. 9. The entry ``Vinyl methyl ether'' is revised to include a reference to``andSection; 173.315'' in column 5(b). Section 172.504(c) is revised to clarify that a rail car does not haveto be placarded when transporting freight containers or transport vehiclesthat do not require placarding. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Part 173 </ITAG>Section 173.5(a)(2) is revised by increasing the capacity of inside packagingsfor liquid agricultural chemicals from 1-gallon to 2\1/2\ gallons whenoffered for transportation in less-than-case-lot quantities. Section 173.25(c) is amended by deleting the words ``Poison B material''in order to clarify that a hazardous material labeled POISON is subjectto the restrictions of this section, even if it meets the definition foranother hazard class.In andSection; 173.31, the following changes are made:1. Paragraph (a)(7) is removed and reserved.2. Paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) are revised to reflect the latest changesregarding coupler vertical restraint systems on tank cars.3. Two commenters expressed opposing views on the provision in proposednew paragraph (c)(14) for checking a tank car's excess flow valve for tightnessat the time of retest. One commenter contended the proposal implies thatall tank car tank valves having threaded seats must be tightened with awrench. The other commenter believed that any time a valve over a seatis removed, the valve seats should be tightened with a 24-inch wrench orlonger. RSPA and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) believe thatthe requirement, as written, allows for the tightening of the valve seatsby whatever means necessary to accomplish the job, and imposes little orno burden on tank car repairers or shippers. Therefore, the provision isadopted as proposed.4. A new paragraph (d)(10) is added to permit the shipment of certain multi-unittank car tanks, under specified conditions, after expiration of the retestdate.In the Table following the introductory paragraph in andSection; 173.34 (e),the entry ``DOT 3A, 3AA, 3AL'' is revised to read ``DOT 3A, 3AA'' and aseparate entry is added for ``DOT 3AL'' to clarify that DOT 3AL cylindersmust be retested every 5 years.Section 173.115 is revised to permit certain alcohol solutions to be reclassifiedas combustible liquids, even when they contain ORM-E materials, and toindicate that solutions which are hazardous substances and hazardous wastesare subject to regulation in all instances. Section 173.118(a) is revised to exclude from consideration constituentsin flammable liquids that are classed as an ORM-E. Section 173.118a(b)(7) is revised to clarify that combustible liquids intank cars are subject to the unloading requirements in andSection; 174.67.In andSection; 173.182, the footnote in paragraph (a) is revised by removingthe date referenced for The Fertilizer Institute's publication. The August1984 edition of the publication is being incorporated by reference in andSection;171.7 of this final rule. It was discovered that andSection; 173.245(a)(29) which proposed the authorizationof monoethanolamine; <T3>primary amyl alcohol</T3> for MC 303 cargo tanks made of aluminum,was in error. The exemption, DOT-E 8732 erroneously prescribed the MC 306and MC 303 cargo tanks made of aluminum or steel as authorized packagingsfor monoethanolamine; <T3>primary amyl alcohol.</T3> We have no knowledge of any MC 303 cargotanks made of aluminum which are used to transport monoethanolamine; <T3>primary amyl alcohol.</T3> Therefore, andSection; 173.245 (a)(29) remainsunchanged. Section 173.249a(d)(3) is adopted as proposed. One commenter objected tothe use of nonspecification packagings for certain corrosives that containa high percentage of acetic acid, citing an incident involving the spillageof coal tar dye from an opened-head fiber drum, which overturned and thelid came off. The commenter believed that if the drum had been a DOT specificationfiber drum with an inner liner, the spillage would not have occurred. However,the commenter provided no data to indicate that a deficiency in the containerwas the cause of the incident, and RSPA does not believe withdrawal ofthe proposed change is warranted.RSPA has adopted the proposed change to andSection; 173.250 concerning theshipment of motor vehicles equipped with electric storage batteries byvessel. However, the change is made to paragraph (b) instead of paragraph(a) as proposed in the notice. See discussion in this preamble to andSection;176.905(k).It was proposed to revise andSection; 173.262 (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3),to prohibit the transportation of Hydrobromic acid greater than 49 percentin polyethylene packagings. The proposed change was based on data receivedby RSPA that problems with permeation have been experienced. However, acommenter requested that these provisions be retained and submitted substantialdata which support the continued use of polyethylene packagings for shippingHydrobromic acid. Provisions authorizing the use of polyethylene packagingsare retained, but a provision is added to require that these packages mustsatisfy the requirements in andSection; 173.24(d) pertaining to permeabilityprior to the first shipment.Section 173.264(b)(1) is revised to authorize the use of DOT 3BN cylindersfor the transportation of Hydrofluoric acid, anhydrous (hydrogen fluoride).Section 173.301(d)(3) is amended by authorizing ``1,1-Difluoroethylene''in manifolded cylinders. A commenter, in responding to proposed andSection;173.301(1), stated that the proposed requirement for mounting DOT 3AX,3AAX, and 3T cylinders on a motor vehicle or in ISO frames for transportationis overly-restrictive, and that there is no reason for requiring only ISOframes. RSPA agrees and has revised paragraph (1) to authorize the cylindersto be transported in ISO or other frames of equivalent structural integrity.In andSection; 173.304, the following changes are made: 1. The Table in paragraph (a)(2) is amended by adding an entry for ``1,1Difluoroethylene'' in alphabetical sequence; a new Note 12 is added inthe entry for ``Insecticide, liquefied gas''; and a new Note 13 is addedin the entry for ``Refrigerant gas, n.o.s., or Dispersant gas, n.o.s.''2. Paragraph (b) is amended by adding ``1,1-Difluoroethylene'' to follow``carbon dioxide''. In the Table in andSection; 173.314(c), the entry for ``Bromotrifluoromethane''is corrected by reinstating the DOT-105A500W tank car which was deletedinadvertently under another rulemaking. In the Table in andSection; 173.315(a)(1), the entries ``Carbon dioxide,refrigerated liquid'' and ``Nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid'' are correctedto reference paragraph (c)(1) instead of paragraph (c). An editorial correction is made to Table 4 in andSection; 173.417(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Part 174 </ITAG>Section 174.510 is revised by removing the data referenced for The FertilizerInstitute's publication. The August 1984 edition of the publication isbeing incorporated by reference in andSection; 171.7 of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Part 175 </ITAG>RSPA proposed to include in andSection; 175.10(a)(5) an exception for personswho are traveling under the provisions of 14 CFR 108.11 (a) and (b), andare carrying small arms ammunition, from having to comply with the specifiedrequirements. This proposal is adopted with a minor change. Two commenterssuggested that RSPA also should permit, for persons who are subject toandSection; 175.10(a)(5), the use of a specially designed packaging for smallamounts of ammunition when carried in baggage. RSPA agrees with the commentersand has adopted their suggestion. In andSection; 175.10(a)(7), the referenceto ``135.114'' is revised to read ``135.91''. <ITAG tagnum="84">F. Part 176 </ITAG>Section 176.11(a) is revised to authorize hazardous materials to be stowedand segregated in accordance with the IMDG Code. A provision on gravity type tanks in andSection; 176.340(a)(2) is removed.Gravity type tanks approved under 46 CFR 98.35 were no longer authorizedfor use after October 1, 1984. Three persons commented on the proposal concerning nonspecification portabletanks in new andSection; 176.340 (a)(4) and (b), one in support and two opposed.The opposing commenters criticized the system under which the nonspecificationportable tanks would be built and tested, and recommended instead thatsuch construction and testing be closely monitored by the United StatesCoast Guard (USCG). RSPA and USCG do not agree with these comments. Torequire such procedures for the nonspecification portable tanks in questionwould create an additional administrative burden, paperwork burden, anda time delay on tank manufacturers and the government. The proposed nonspecificationportable tanks are similar to DOT 57 portable tanks, with the exceptionof having a larger rated capacity, vibration testing, and marking requirements.The DOT 57 specification authorizes manufacturers to certify portable tanksas conforming to the specification. DOT 57 portable tanks are authorizedto transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials. The nonspecificationportable tanks, although similar to a DOT 57, are authorized to transportcombustible liquids only. RSPA and USCG believe that more stringent requirementsfor these nonspecification portable tanks, which are used for combustibleliquids only, are unwarranted. For this same reason, the proposed requirementthat owners retain a copy of the manufacturer's data report during thetime the tank is in service is removed. However, RSPA and USCG believethat it would be in the best interest of the tank manufacturers or theowners of these tanks to retain data pertinent to the manufacture of thenonspecification portable tanks. One commenter objected to the proposed revision of andSection; 176.905(k)on the grounds that requiring the batteries in containerized motor vehiclesto be disconnected would be costly and lead to possible damage to the vehicles.RSPA does not agree with this comment. Existing andSection; 176.905(c) alreadyrequires motor vehicles, whether containerized or not, to have their batteriesdisconnected when stowed below deck. Therefore, the revision would applyonly to motor vehicles carried in containers on deck. The reason for disconnectingthe batteries in a hold or compartment below deck is to reduce the possibilityof an accidental spark in a potentially explosive atmosphere. Such an atmospherecould also develop in the close confines of an unventilated freight container(a warning sign to this effect is required by andSection; 176.905(k)). Inthe interest of eliminating a possible fire hazard on board vessels, andSection;176.905(k) is adopted as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">G. Part 178 </ITAG>One commenter pointed out that the clarification of andSection; 178.39-5significantly impacts the DOT 3BN specification, to the extent that nickelcylinders could no longer be manufactured. This was not RSPA's intention.The provision is revised in the final rule. The Tables in andSection;andSection; 178.224-1(a)(1) and 178.224-2(c) are amendedby increasing the maximum capacity of DOT-21C fiber drums from 55 gallonsto 75 gallons for drums having a net weight of not over 115 pounds and250 pounds respectively. Plastic heads are authorized for certain drums.Two typographical errors noted in the Table in andSection; 178.224-1(a)(1)are also corrected. Proposed andSection; 178.251-7(a) would have required that the certificationplate on new DOT 57 portable tanks be marked ``Leakage test date'' insteadof ``Original test date''. A commenter suggested that to prevent additionalcosts to manufacturers, RSPA should allow manufacturers to mark either``Original test date'' or ``leakage test date'' on tanks. RSPA agrees withthe commenter and has provided for either entry. In either case, the testdate marked on a tank must be the date of the leakage test specified inandSection; 178.253-5(b). <ITAG tagnum="84">H. Part 179 </ITAG>Section 179.14 is revised to reflect the latest changes regarding the couplervertical restraint systems on tank cars. Section 179.100-13(d) is revised to clarify the function of excess flowvalves in tank cars. Except for a typographical error, andSection; 179.100-15 is adopted as proposed.RSPA received no objections to the proposed change to andSection; 179.100-23(c)to authorize the use of an additional head shield design. The provisionis adopted as proposed. In keeping with the Association of American Railroads' request to reflectthe latest changes concerning couplers on tank cars, andSection; 179.105-6is removed and reserved. Four commenters expressed their concerns that requirements for safety ventclosures, as proposed in andSection; 179.200-18(b)(3), may be overly restrictive.RSPA and FRA agreed with the commenters, and have revised the provision.The other changes to 179.200-18 (b) and (c) are adopted. Several typographicalerrors appearing in the section are also corrected. Section 179.201-1(a) is amended by adding references to andSection;andSection;179.202-8, 179.202-11, and 179.202-16 under the ``Special references''column for DOT 111A60W2 tank cars. In andSection; 179.203-1(c), the reference to ``andSection; 173.8'' is amendedto ``andSection; 171.12a''. In andSection; 179.203-1(d), the reference to ``andSection;173.9'' is amended to read ``andSection; 171.12a''. In andSection; 179.300-7(a), the introductory text and the Table are amendedto authorize the use of stainless steel for fabrication of class DOT 106Aand 110A-W tank car tanks. In Part 179, the reference ``andSection; 179.105-6'' is removed and replacedwith the reference of ``andSection; 179.14'' in certain sections.Administrative notices I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. Furthermore, in view of the type of changes herein, theRSPA has further determined that this rulemaking (1) is not ``major'' underExecutive Order 12291; (2) is not ``significant'' under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3) will notaffect not-for profit enterprises, or small governmental jurisdictions;and (4) does not require an environmental impact statement under the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (49 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>) A regulatory evaluation is not considered necessary becausethe anticipated impact is minimal. I have reviewed this regulation in accordancewith Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''). It has no substantial directeffects on the States, in the Federal-State relationship or the distributionof power and responsibilities among levels of government. Thus, this regulationcontains no policies that have Federalism implications, as defined in ExecutiveOrder 12612.
