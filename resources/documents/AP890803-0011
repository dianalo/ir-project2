The network said it had been told by unidentified ``senioradministration officials'' that Bush ``has decided to strike backat the Lebanese Shiites and their Iranian sponsors'' if hisdiplomatic moves failed to prevent the death of the next hostage.   Just what form this retaliation would take was not specified.   A senior Defense Department official, asked about the report,said Wednesday evening, ``I know of no such decision.'' Thisofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney left Washington during the day for a visit tohis home state of Wyoming and said, ``There is a distinctatmosphere of un-crisis around here.''   Another administration official said a message to Iran, theexistence of which was disclosed on Tuesday, had said in substance``if anything happens to the hostages we hold you responsible,''and was conveyed to Tehran trhough two channels, the Swiss embassyrepresenting U.S. interests there and through another government hedeclined to name. This official discussed the message on conditionof anonymity.   Bush sought help from more world leaders and, for the third timein three days, met with top military, diplomatic and nationalsecurity advisers in the Cabinet Room to review developments in thehostage crisis. The White House said no further sessions werescheduled.   ``We are leaving no stone unturned,'' Bush said.   He said he had been incontact with many world leaders, includingBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in telephone calls duringthe day.   ``They face the same problems that we face when it comes toinformation and trying to find out exactly what happened,'' Bushsaid. ``We are not dealing with all the facts.   ``But I've had assurance after assurance from world leaders thatthey want to help,'' the president said.   On the eve of the threatened execution by kidnappers of Americanhostage Joseph Cicippio, Bush was asked if he feared the hostageswere in peril. Alluding to the threats, Bush replied, ``Well, we'reconsidering that that might well be the case, given statements thatwe've seen.''   However, Shiite Moslem sources in Lebanon said they expectedCicippio's captors to spare him at Iran's behest to avert aconfrontation with the United States. International tension alreadywas high after the reported execution Monday of Marine Lt. Col.William Higgins.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said theadministration was pleased with a statement by Iran'sPresident-elect Hashemi Rafsanjani condemning the killing ofHiggins and all acts of a terrorist nature.   She called on Rafsanjani to act ``in accordance with thespirit'' of his statement. ``We remain convinced that Iran is in aposition to bring significant influence to bear on those who holdthe hostages and call on it to do so,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   She also welcomed a statement by a top aide to PalestineLiberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat criticizing theexecution of Higgins.   Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said the USS Belknap, the flagshipof the U.S. 6th Fleet, and the fleet's commander canceled ascheduled visit to the Soviet port of Sevastapol to be ``at thebeck and call'' of Bush in case he needs them.   The aircraft carrier USS America also cut short a visit and leftthe port of Singapore, officials said.   ``We're prudently planning,'' Bush said of the military moves.   On the other hand, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwateradvised reporters ``not to read a lot into those movements ... Iwould not attach a great deal of significance to them.''   Bush, posing for pictures in the Oval Office with the visitingforeign minister of the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain, SheikMohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, said the administration wasdealing with the hostage crisis ``with a heavy heart'' because ofHiggins' reported death.   ``We are thinking prudently about this matter in every possibleway,'' the president said. ``We have exercised every diplomaticchannel that I can think of. ...   ``We've been in touch _ I have, personally, with many worldleaders, and our State Department has fleshed his out, so we'releaving no stone unturned,'' Bush said.   ``But regrettably ... we're dealing with less than a full deckwhen it comes to information,'' he added. ``It is very hard whenyou're dealing with this kind of cowardice and this kind ofdastardly act to get all the information that you need to make adecision.''   Afterward, Sheik Mohammed told reporters outside the White Housethat, ``I think in the next few days something must come to stopthis kind of killing of innocent people.''   The president was asked by reporters if it would make matterseasier if Israel released the Moslem cleric whose kidnapping byIsrael inflamed the hostage situation.   ``I have made clear the position of the United States that Ithink a release of everyone held against their will would be a goodthing,'' Bush replied.   Separately, Fitzwater said the United States has not askedIsrael to release the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   The official who discussed the message to Iran said the UnitedStates had told Israel, through the embassies in Washington and TelAviv, on several occasions that it ``neither approves nordisapproves'' Israel's proposed swap of Obeid for hostages held bythe Shiites.   Bush and White House officials made a deliberate attempt toquell any suggestion that the administration was paralyzed bycrisis.   ``I don't want anyone in this country or around the world tothink that it (the hotage ordeal) is anything of other thantremendous concern,'' Bush said. ``But we must prudently move onwith the business of our country.''   Administration officials said a study of a videotape purportingto show Higgins dead by hanging was inconclusive as to the identityof the victim or when the victim was killed.   ``There are those who think the circumstantial evidence from thevideotape would indicate that the victim did not die by hanging,however there is is no conclusive proof of that or any proof ofwhen it happened,'' said one official, insisting on anonymity.   The New York Times said in Thursday editions that the CIA hadtold the White House it believed Higgins was probably killed beforeMonday, according to unidentified officials who said the conclusionwas based in part on ``conversations'' with nations in contact withthe Hezbollah. A call to CIA spokesmen Wednesday night was notimmediately returned.   In another development, the Senate displayed growing frustrationwith terrorist kidnappings and murders, voting to instruct the CIAand Pentagon to report by Sept. 1 on how best to locate and rescueAmerican hostages in Lebanon.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., meanwhile, said hiscriticism of Israel this week was not helping terrorists drive awedge between the United States and the Jewish state, as criticscontended.   ``My basic message to Israel is this. We are in this together.We both have vital interests at stake. Whenever possible we oughtto act together. And always we ought to take fully into account thevital interests of the other, when we contemplate unilateralaction,'' Dole said.</TEXT></DOC>
