Approval would send the proposed statutory ban to President Bushfor his signature, despite his statement last week that he regardsanything short of a constitutional amendment as inadequate.   The House postponed until Thursday a vote, originally scheduledfor today, on the bill that would outlaw flag defacement by simplestatute. It already approved the legislation, 380-38, on Sept. 12but in slightly different form.   Meanwhile, the Senate plans to take up the constitutionalamendment backed by Bush and Republican leaders next Monday and theHouse plans to consider that measure afterward.   The Senate approved the bill on the statute, 91-9, lastThursday. Before doing so, it made a number of changes and theHouse must pass upon them before the measure can go to thepresident's desk.   As approved by the Senate, the bill says, ``Whoever knowinglymutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on thefloor or ground or tramples upon any flag of the United Statesshall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than oneyear or both.''   The maximum fine would be $1,000.   Federal law already calls for precisely those penalties fordefacing the flag. Supporters of the change say, however, thecurrent statute would likely be ruled unconstitutional by theSupreme Court.   Bush called for an amendment after a Supreme Court ruling inJune that threw out a Texas flag-burning case on grounds that thestate statute was an unconstitutional limit on freedom of speech.   The wording of the federal statute is similar to the Texasstatute.   Democratic sponsors designed the latest legislation to ban anyact of flag defacement without considering whether it is part of apolitical protest. They hope that will shield it against any courtchallenge on free-speech grounds.   They are trying to head off an amendment they say would limitfreedoms guaranteed under the Bill of Rights in response to anisolated flag-burning incident.   Republican supporters of a constitutional amendment, such asSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, contend no statutory ban on flag burningis likely to pass a court test, regardless of how carefully it isphrased.   All but a few Senate Republicans, however, voted for thestatutory ban. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a critic of boththe bill and the amendment, said some lawmakers probably voted outof fear that a ``no'' vote would come back to haunt them incampaigns.   Metzenbaum and several other lawmakers have said, however, thatthe heat over the issue has subsided since it flared over thesummer.</TEXT></DOC>
