Dunn, executive vice president of Dow Jones andamp; Co.andM;Customer frustration with the expense and difficulty of culling informationfrom databases isn't news to major providers of on-line services.andP;  Most ofDow Jone's competitors have also started to offer friendlier ways to findinformation in their databases.andP;  These include easy-to-follow menus, andsoftware that helps you design data searches off-line.andP;  Both methods helpreduce on-line costs.andP;  Executives at on-line information companies readilyacknowledge that unless they make it easier to understand and use theirservices, they will never reach an untapped customer base that numbers in themillions.andM;A decade ago, the proponents of on-line service believed that by now mostbusinesspeople with a computer and modem would be logging on for stockquotes, copies of newspaper articles, or corporate reports.andP;  But the market,which consists of potentially as many as 73 million so-called knowledgeworkers, was never fully tapped.andP;  News/Retrieval has fewer than 300,000subscribers.andP;  Compu-Serve, based n Columbus, Ohio, is the nation's largestprovider of on-line information services, with more than 500,000 subscribers.andM;The main reason for News/Retrieval's low number of subscribers, says DowJones's Dunn, was its confusing search system.andP;  Customers were frustrated byspending time on-line and coming up empty-handed.andM;Specialists agree that traditional computer-search techniques, usually basedon arcane Boolen logic, have turned users off.andP;  Indeed, communicationsanalysts Gary Arlen of Washington, D.C., describes Dow Jones's former systemas &quot;user-surly at its finest.&quot;andM;English-language queriesandM;Attempting to both remedy the problem and attract new users, Dow Jones hasinvested $5 million in two Connection Machine computers, made by ThinkingMachines Corp. in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  They offer computing power that is 1,000times faster than the old equipment and, with the new software, let asubscriber query News/Retrieval in English sentences.andP;  Dunn says the newDowQuest system &quot;gives the appearance of understanding the question and givesyou what it thinks you want.&quot;andM;About 150 News/Retrieval customers tested DowQuest in January, and a sampleof 10,000 customers received unlimited free service for the month of March.andO;By midyear Dow Jones will have introduced the remainder of its 285,000customers to DowQuest.andM;Initially, Dow Jones will charges $1 per minute for News/Retrieval searchesthat use DowQuest.andP;  Customers usually pay $2.14 to $2.80 per minute duringprimetime hours.andP;  During the next six months, the company will look atseveral pricing structures before settling on a firm fee for DowQuest.andP;  DowJone's startup fee of $29.95 included three free on-line hours so thatcustomers can become comfortable with the system.andP;  After the first year, theannual service fee goes down to $18.andM;While Dow Jones made a major investment in new hardware, its competitors inon-line services hope to accomplish the same task with less-expensivesoftware upgrades.andP;  CompuServe introduced a new version of CompuServeNavigator, a Macintosh program that lets you set up a search before goingon-line.andP;  The program is expecially valuable for eliminating &quot;all the cryptic[search] commands and taking away that sense of waiting for something tohappen,&quot; says Nick Arnett, editor of Multimedia Computing andamp; Presentations,published by Creative Strategies Research International, a market researchfirm in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;Late this summer CompuServe customers will see more improvements, saysspokeswoman Kathleen Munger Thomas.andP;  &quot;We're working on a new interface thatwill make the service even easier to use.&quot;andM;Programs similar to CompuServe Navigator are available for the IBM PC andcompatible computers.andP;  Three years ago Dialog Information SErvices, anotherleading on-line information provider, introduced DialogLink.andP;  The softwarelets you frame a query off-line rather than on-line while charges are addingup.andP;  Still other programs save time and money by automatically storing dataon a disk so that you can read it off-line, at your leisure.andM;Preparing searches off-lineandM;Mead Data Central in Dayton, Ohio, with 400,000 subscribers to medical,legal, and general-interest databases, was scheduled, at press time torelease Nexis News Plus in April.andP;  Like Dialog's program, the software letsyou plan a search off-line.andP;  In addition, the Mead program tells you ahead oftime how much a search will cost and gives you the actual after-session cost.andO;It lets you request as many as 32 searches, which it conducts sequentially,says Richard Anderson Jr., Mead Data Contral's vice president for corporateinformation services.andM;Can't please everyoneandM;Industry executives are finding, however, that the trend toward friendlierinterfaces doesn't please everyone.andP;  When Dow Jones surveyed customers aboutDowQuest, those who were skilled at using News/Retrieval were less satisfiedwith DowQuest and its ability to pinpoint information than they were withNews/Retrieval's older interface.andP;  If, for example, you initiate a DowQuestsearch by typing factual information such as &quot;earthquake in Armenia,&quot; notesKen Bosomworth, president of International Resource Development (IRD), amarket research firm in New Canaan, Conn., you'll probably get the data youwant.andP;  However, you may become frustrated if you pose a question thatinvolves concepts and reasoning.andP;  For example, if you type &quot;What are theunderlying problems of the automobile industry?&quot; the response--if you get oneat all--may be less illuminating than you'd hoped it would be.andM;Despite improvements, analysts say information services habe a long way to gobefore they can truly reach the masses.andP;  &quot;The typical on-line service is inthe Dark Ages,&quot; says Arnett of Creative Strategies International.andP;  And he ismost doubtful about English-based data searches.andP;  &quot;English is an inefficientlanguage,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;When you know what you want and you want to get itquickly, English is not the best way to do it.&quot;andM;Improvements to on-line information services, say providers, are a responseto customer demands for ease, efficiency, accuracy, and speed.andP;  But industryanalysts say that rapid growth of CD-ROM technology could be a factor in thepush to keep on-line customers satisfied.andM;A compact disk can hold more than 200,000 pages of the same business andfinancial data available from on-line services.andP;  If immediacy is notparamount, weekly CD-ROM updates can be far cheaper than getting the sameinformation on-line.andP;  Dow Jone's Dunn acknowledges the niche CD-ROMtechnology has carved into the market.andP;  But he dismisses the notion thatcompact disks will replace on-line services.andP;  &quot;There's a place for both,&quot; hesays.andM;Still, the new CD-ROM technology is a factor that provides of on-lineservices really hadn't reckoned with until recently.andP;  Says IRD's Bosomworth:&quot;The [on-line services] vendor is going to see his revenues get a haircut.&quot;andM;CONNECTION MACHINES: MOVING DATA BY BRUTE FORCEandM;In its bid to make its News/Retrieval on-line service more efficient anduser-friendly, Dow Jones andamp; Co. is banking on the Connection Machine, asuperpowerful parallel-processing computer that looks likes Darth Vadersqueezed into a Rubik's cube.andP;  The five-foot high stark black cuve is made upof eight subcubes.andM;Introduced in 1985 by Thinking Machines Corp.andP;  (Cambridge, Mass), theConnection Machine contains 65,536 processors, each with its own memory, plusa high-speed communications network.andP;  By assigning one processor to eachelement of data, a Connection Machine can compute millions of data pointssimultaneously.andP;  In this way, you can search an entire database in the timethat it normally takes to search a single document.andM;Inside the Connection Machine, a unique communications network moves dataamong processors at billions of bits per second.andP;  The system's designers areproud of the machine's ability to process 2,500 million instructions persecond (mips).andP;  &quot;Comparing the difference in performance between a ConnectionMachine and a large mainfrme is like comparing a [Boeing] 747 with abicycle,&quot; says a company executive.andM;The pplications for which the machine was designed include signal processing,numerical-algorithm design, and fluid-dynamics analysis.andP;  But it's theConnection Machine's promise in the area of data retrieval that makes itattractive to on-line services.andM;Executive at Thinking Machines Corp. boast that fewer than five minutes oftraining is all a novice needs to perform searches.andP;  &quot;It's query by example,&quot;says sales manager Gary Rancourt.andP;  &quot;Show me a piece of text you like, andI'll search the database for others.&quot;andM;Using an algorithm that searches a whole document the system scans terms inthe example and compares them to terms in other documents in the database.andO;After making comparisons, the processors exchange information and rank thedocuments according to how closely they match the search sample.andP;  You mayalso select a paragraph and the system will search based on the contents ofthat paragraph.andM;The Connection Machine is not intelligent--that is, it retrieves documentswithout understanding their content.andP;  But the computer may some day beprogrammed to mimic elements of human reasoning.andP;  If so, Thinking MachinesCorp. will have built, to parrot the company slogan, &quot;a machine that will beproud of us.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
