The outhouse, hastily constructed at a Soviet missile base near Minsk, was a welcome sight for Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, director of the new U.S. On Site Inspection Agency, earlier this month. He led the first U.S. inspection team to visit a Soviet missile base under the recently signed treaty to ban intermediate-range nuclear weapons based in Europe. Unlike the all-male Soviet inspection teams then heading for the U.S. West Coast, one out of every ten U.S. inspectors is a woman.    &quot;The Russians have been extremely accommodating,&quot; says Gen. Lajoie. His teams have inspected 40 Soviet missile sites, many in remote areas previously closed to foreigners. He says Soviet generals went out of their way to provide hospitality and freshly redecorated quarters.    &quot;Their flexibility on procedural aspects surprised us,&quot; he adds. &quot;They were not only technically correct, but in some cases they went beyond that, showing us support buildings that were outside the sites covered by the treaty.&quot;    U.S. teams have much to do under the treaty, which took effect July 1. Within 60 days they must inspect 133 Soviet sites, where Soviet SS-20 nuclear missiles are based, manufactured or used in training exercises.    Soviet inspectors, with only 26 sites to look at, are working at a more leisurely pace. A team of 40 Russian experts left Washington, D.C., this past weekend to visit four U.S. sites associated with the Pershing I and Pershing II missiles. They include a test range at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Ala., where the missiles are repaired and stored.    Earlier this month, other teams of Soviet inspectors visited five missile-related sites on the West Coast and two missile bases in West Germany. The U.S. bases in West Germany are used either for Pershing II missiles or ground-launched cruise missiles, both of which the treaty will ban along with the SS-20.    These first visits are called &quot;baseline inspections,&quot; done to assure each side that the bases contain the number of missiles specified in treaty negotiations. After the two-month inspection period, preparations will begin to remove the missiles to specially prepared sites in the U.S. and the Soviet Union, where the missiles will be destroyed. </TEXT></DOC>
