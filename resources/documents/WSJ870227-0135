The closely held health care and investment concern controlled by LeRoy A. Pesch, a Chicago physician, said in a statement that it still hopes to acquire American Medical through a friendly transaction. But Pesch clearly is trying to put the company's management under pressure to negotiate.    As previously reported, American Medical rejected Pesch's all-cash $20-a-share proposal two weeks ago. Since then, three American Medical shareholders sued the company, objecting to the rejection.    An American Medical spokesman said yesterday that the company's board &quot;will review and assess&quot; the sweetened bid, but he wouldn't say when it will respond.    Terms of the revised proposal include $17 cash, preferred stock with an intended market value of $4, and common stock with an intended market value of $1 for each of American Medical's 86.9 million shares outstanding. Pesch said the bid is good through March 10.    Pesch, which launched the previous bid without having retained an investment banking firm, said yesterday it is now represented by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., a New York investment banking company, and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group, a unit of the big Los Angeles-based banking concern.    Dr. Pesch, the former son-in-law of insurance magnate W. Clement Stone, last year led a $406.2 million leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp., a Dallas health care concern. Dr. Pesch couldn't be reached yesterday.    Bama B. Rucker, senior health care analyst with San Francisco-based Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc., said that while Pesch's sweetened bid is a &quot;fair price by market estimates,&quot; American Medical's board most likely will turn Pesch away once again. &quot;This isn't somebody to whom they want to be wedded,&quot; she said, adding that American Medical would prefer a suitor that could offer &quot;stronger management.&quot;    But Randall Huyser, an analyst who follows health care stocks for San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities, said it is unlikely that another health care company will come forward with a higher, friendly offer. He said that if Pesch proceeds with a hostile bid and can arrange adequate financing, American Medical may propose its own share buyback or leveraged buyout.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    Beverly Hills, Calif.-based American Medical, which has 159 health care facilities in the U.S. and abroad, posted large losses last year and began a reorganization that involved consolidation of regional offices, personnel reductions and the closing of its unprofitable group health insurance operations.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Medical shares closed at $19.375, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
