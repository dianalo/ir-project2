Its chairman since April, Jonathan T. Taplin, has shrunk the payroll, reorganized the company, and acquired new product lines.    Mr. Taplin, 40 years old, plans more steps to stem Berkey's losses and build the concern into a global importer and exporter modeled on one he admires particularly, Japan's huge Sumitomo Corp.    Berkey has a long way to go. Its 1987 revenue from continuing operations was a trifling $113 million. Sumitomo's yearly trading volume exceeds $100 billion. What makes Mr. Taplin think he can pull it off? It's a question of vision and focus, he asserts, adding, &quot;I see Berkey as an international trading and distribution company.&quot;    The old management left after a series of events that began in late 1986, when Mr. Taplin and two partners -- Paul Bluhdorn and Jac Holzman -- took advantage of Berkey's depressed stock price to buy a 13% stake for $2.6 million. Mr. Bluhdorn later sold his interest to Mr. Holzman.    In August, Mr. Holzman and Mr. Taplin, who was elected to the board in December 1986, began running Berkey as co-chief executive officers. Mr. Taplin took over as sole chief executive last month. Mr. Taplin, who lives in Santa Monica, Calif., with his wife and three children, works out of offices in Greenwich, Conn., Berkey's headquarters, and Los Angeles. His salary is $195,000 a year.    Once a high-volume photofinisher, and still a merchandiser of cameras, Berkey had pressed a long-running civil antitrust complaint against Eastman Kodak Co. that was settled in 1981. Berkey got $6.8 million, not even enough to offset its legal fees. The company had a loss of $13.7 million in 1986 and expects to report an $8 million loss for 1987. The company never lost its New York Stock Exchange listing although its stock has fallen far from its $53 peak in 1969. Yesterday, the stock closed at $3.125, down 25 cents, in composite trading.    Mr. Taplin is projecting a profit of at least $2.7 million, or 59 cents a share, for 1988, on sales of at least $145 million. Those numbers will be larger, he says, if a search for acquisitions succeeds. Berkey's major business is arranging sales promotions for drugstores and variety stores, selling them packages that include a variety of products -- radios, clocks, pens and the like -- along with coupons.    Berkey Marketing Cos., the division that distributed photographic equipment, is being discontinued. Mr. Taplin says he ended almost all of Berkey Marketing's contracts with suppliers, mostly in West Germany and Japan, because of unfavorable terms that required Berkey to buy more inventory than it needed.    But Berkey will continue to distribute photographic products, as well as video and home electronics products, through a new division, Greenwich-based Omega Co., which expects 1988 sales exceeding $25 million. Omega will sell its own brand of cameras and accessories made by contractors in Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.    Mr. Taplin also lined up products for Berkey's most important unit, Bandamp;E Sales Co., a sales-promotion concern in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. Bandamp;E, which expects 1988 sales of $90 million, is distributing Walt Disney videocassettes and Yamaha musical keyboards.    As for Willoughby's, a New York electronics store owned by Berkey, Mr. Taplin plans to keep it and perhaps create branches. Willoughby's doesn't fit into Mr. Taplin's concept of a trading company, he concedes. But the store generates cash: It expects annual sales of $30 million.    Mr. Taplin, whose late father was a corporate lawyer, grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and studied English literature at Princeton. He began his career as a road manager for touring musicians, including Judy Collins and Mr. Dylan. In 1971, he helped George Harrison produce the Madison Square Garden concerts to benefit starving people in Bangladesh.    Later, Mr. Taplin moved from Woodstock, N.Y., to Los Angeles and, with $300,000 mostly saved from his earnings, helped finance &quot;Mean Streets,&quot; a low-budget film that became a hit. He also produced &quot;The Last Waltz,&quot; &quot;Carny,&quot; &quot;Under Fire,&quot; and, most recently, &quot;My Science Project.&quot;    He ended a brief career in corporate finance at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in Los Angeles in 1986. &quot;It was very bureaucratic,&quot; Mr. Taplin says. Using his personal computer to look for investments, he spotted Berkey on a standard list.    In one of his first steps toward global trading, he says, Berkey will form a venture with Indamerica International Inc., Los Angeles, a trading company owned by investor Ronald Lye. It will sell U.S.-made computer peripherals in Europe and the Far East and seek foreign goods for sale in the U.S. Mr. Taplin says he will use &quot;the classic trading-company strategies of the Japanese,&quot; such as lining up customers even before goods are acquired. </TEXT></DOC>
