Every four yearssome presidential candidates try to sell protectionism toGranite State voters, and in every election they refuse tobuy it.   Americans do like to grouse about foreign-trade practices,but when they go into the voting booth they generally resistblaming all their economic woes on foreigners. Consider thetreatment voters meted out to this year's trade-bashers.</LP><TEXT>   Iowa Senator Tom Harkin had the enthusiastic backing ofunions in pushing his flat-earth views on trade. He ran an adthat attacked Paul Tsongas as one of several &quot;weak Democrats. . . who support the Bush trade plan&quot; that will &quot;send yourjobs abroad.&quot; Mr. Tsongas fired back with a stirring defenseof free trade: &quot;Protectionism is a death trap. This countrywent through disaster 60 years ago when it went down thatroad, and it is Tom's hope that people do not rememberhistory.&quot; Mr. Harkin came in fourth with 10% of the vote.   At the instigation of Democratic guru Bob Shrum, SenatorBob Kerrey trotted out a TV ad in which he said U.S. tradepolicy should be conducted like a hockey game and pledged to&quot;tell Japan if we can't sell in their market, they can't sellin ours.&quot; After the ad ran, Mr. Kerrey saw his poll ratingsplummet from 16% to 8%, and he ended up just edging out Mr.Harkin. He at least acknowledged that the commercial was adisaster.   The winners in the Democratic primary were the two mostunabashed supporters of open trade. Together, Paul Tsongasand Bill Clinton won 60% of the vote.   Pat Buchanan's protectionist braintrust, the U.S.Industrial Council, is touting his New Hampshire showing asan endorsement of trade restrictions. But Mr. Buchanan'sadvisers admit he eschewed the word &quot;protectionism,&quot; anddidn't make it the subject of any of his innumerablecommercials. He downplayed his views on trade and immigrationwhen they failed to rouse audiences.   The exit polls show New Hampshire voters were interestedin sending George Bush a message on taxes, not trade. Some30% mentioned Mr. Bush's violation of his &quot;no-new-taxes&quot;pledge as a very important factor in their vote; only 5%mentioned trade. Of those who did, 60% voted for Mr. Bush,the more free-trade candidate. That shouldn't be toosurprising in a state where nearly half the voters own aforeign car.   If protectionism didn't sell this year inrecession-wracked New Hampshire, exactly when and where willit bring electoral dividends?   In 1980, John Connally was an early Japan-basher -- andwon one delegate after spending $12 million. In 1984, WalterMondale muzzled his protectionist message after losing earlyprimaries to free-trader Gary Hart. When Bob Dole and PatRobertson pandered to South Carolina primary voters in 1988by endorsing tariffs on textile imports, George Bush attackedthem and won resoundingly. Dick Gephardt's infamousKorea-bashing Hyundai ad helped end his candidacy that year.Mike Dukakis's last-minute appeals to curb foreign investmentfell flat. Protectionism is often touted by campaignconsultants as a cure-all for politicians behind in thepolls. Instead, it often ends up killing the candidate.   George Bush's poor New Hampshire showing has raised fearsthat the White House might back away from its commitment to aNorth American free-trade accord. Such a move would conjureup images of a panic-driven White House and further undermineconfidence in the Bush presidency. History amply demonstratesthat in the U.S., protectionism is a political loser.</TEXT></DOC>
