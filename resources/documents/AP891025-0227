(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of the Lac du FlambeauChippewa tribe Wednesday rejected a $35.6 million pact with thestate to curtail the Indians' off-reservation hunting and fishing.   Outside the tribal hall, a crowd of people protesting theagreement erupted in chants and screams of jubilation when told at9:25 p.m. of the outcome: 439 votes against the plan and 366 for it.   The pact, which many had expected to pass, would have paid thetribe for not fishing for 10 years, then been renegotiated. Someceremonial fishing would still have been allowed.   ``I feel great,'' said Scott Smith, a Lac du Flambeau member.``They saved our rights.''   Before the vote, about 30 to 40 opponents carried signscriticizing the agreement as a ``sellout'' of the tribe's 19thcentury treaty rights and some heckled tribal government officialswho walked by.   The treaty rights, which courts have ruled allow Indians tospearfish off their reservations, have caused controversy andsparked some violence. Some sports fishermen are angered that theChippewa can fish with spears and out of season, which otherfishermen cannot do.   ``Our ancestors thought enough to preserve our rights throughthis treaty and our council is selling it,'' said Dorothy Thoms, atribal member who lives on the reservation in northwesternWisconsin.   Tribal Chairman Mike Allen ordered the tribal center secured byofficers, saying the action was ``due to numerous threats todisrupt the referendum election or take over the building.''   Allen said he received a death threat after he left a meeting onthe reservation Tuesday night.   ``They threatened me last night after the meeting and we've hadnumerous threats and calls,'' Allen said. He said the death threatwas made in person, although he declined to identify the individual.   About 10 officers from tribal police, the Great Lakes IndianFish and Wildlife Commission and Vilas County Sheriff's Departmentpatrolled near the center.   Ms. Thoms said the protesters were prepared to go to jail iftribal officials tried to quash their last-ditch efforts. ``I'vegot my medicine and my toothbrush in my purse,'' she said.   The state's six Chippewa bands retain spearfishing, hunting,food gathering and timber cutting rights under court-affirmed 19thcentury treaties that ceded northern Wisconsin to the federalgovernment.   The Lac du Flambeau, with about 2,500 members, is traditionallythe most active of the state's Chippewa bands during thespearfishing season.   In recent years, opponents of the treaty rights have stagedlarge and sometimes violent protests at lakes where the Indianshave spearfished. Last spring nearly 200 protesters were arrested.   The settlement with the Lac du Flambeau would have established a$35.6 million trust fund from which individual tribal members wouldhave been paid. If it had been approved, it would have advanced tothe Wisconsin Legislature, where it faced opposition.   Before the vote, Allen said the plan would advance no further ifit were defeated and the band is unlikely to continue negotiationswith the state.   Opponents had thought there was little hope the agreement wouldbe voted down. They said a plan to give each tribal member $1,800in the first year of the agreement would probably ensure itspassage.   ``The Great Spirit won over tonight,'' said Thomas Maulson, anorganizer of the off-reservation spearfishing. ``The Lac duFlambeau people came through.''</TEXT></DOC>
