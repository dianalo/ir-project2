Rough, was sentenced to six months in prisonWednesday for leaking secret interest rate data.   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise also ordered the50-year-old ex-banker, who made an emotional plea for mercy beforethe sentencing, to perform 200 hours of community service during twoyears of probation.   Debevoise called the case ``particularly sad'' and said he wasconvinced that Rough's anguished expression of remorse in hisremarks to the judge ``came from the heart.''   But he said jail time for Rough was ``essential for the publicperception of the fairness of the system'' _ that white collarcriminals, and those with advantaged backgrounds, be properlypunished.   ``I breached a trust placed in me, and in doing so, blemished thereputation of the institution I still revere,'' said Rough, hisvoice quavering with emotion.   He said a picture of former Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker remains hanging on his wall. The Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork is part of the Fed's regional system.   Rough sat on the New York Fed's board from 1982 to 1984 whilepresident of the National Bank of Sussex County in Branchville.While there, Rough admitted in a plea bargain, he regularlydisclosed advance word regarding the Fed's discount rate to anow-defunct Livingston brokerage firm, Bevill, Bresler andamp; SchulmanInc. The discount rate is the Fed's interest charge on loans tofinancial institutions.   Bevill, Bresler traded in government securities, the market ofwhich is powerfully affected by the discount rate.   Federal authorities called the case the first to involve insidertrading of government securities, and the first such charges againsta director in the Fed system.   Rough could have received up to five years in prison. But in anunusual move, the U.S. attorney's office recommended that if Roughwas sent to prison, it should be for less than a year. AssistantU.S. Attorney Paul Weissman, in a pre-sentencing memo, said Roughexpected no financial gain.   Debevoise agreed to recommend that Rough serve his sentence,beginning Oct. 16, at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, a minimumsecurity prison camp. Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, who hadasked for probation, said his client would probably serve about 4{months, accounting for time off for good behavior.   Rough's career as a prosperous ``country banker'' who onceaspired to be chairman of the Federal Deposity Insurance Corporationbegan to unravel in the spring of 1987, when witnesses at the trialof Bevill, Bresler president Gilbert C. Schulman disclosed theallegations.   Rough usually leaked the data to Schulman, and blamed his actionson a misguided friendship with the Bevill, Bresler official.Schulman and four other top executives of the firm were sent toprison in connection with its April 1985 collapse.   In his remarks to Debevoise, Rough said his life was in tattersfollowing the December 1988 indictment. Rough said his wife isseeking a divorce, his funds vanished, his career finished, his sonsin trouble with the law and his reputation gone.   ``I am an outcast in the banking community and my owncommunity,'' he said. ``These past few years have been truly aliving hell.''   Rough began in the banking world as a bank runner at age 14 andstarted working as a management trainee and auditor at the New YorkFed in 1961. He joined the National Bank of Sussex eight yearslater, and rose to president in 1978 during explosive growth at therural institution.   Banking was in his veins, he said, with his grandfather andfather in the industry. Rough said he still wore his father'sretirement watch.   Rough said he remembered being scolded as a youth by his father.   ``He would shake his head and say, `Son, you let me down.' Godknows my dad must be shaking his head now,'' said Rough, his voicechoked with emotion.</TEXT></DOC>
