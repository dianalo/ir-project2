But on some day in the next 19 months, a switch will be thrownand market-watchers will train their telescopes on Cincinnati toobserve what many foresee as the dawn of a new age: the era of24-hour stock trading.   There will be no daily opening or close, at least not as we knowthem today, and there will be no floor crowded with noisy, jostlingtraders. There will be only the computer, humming, clicking andbeeping as it matches buy and sell orders streaming in from pointsall over the globe.   Such is the hope of the Cincinnati exchange and its partners inthe venture, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and London-basedReuters Holdings PLC, which jointly announced their plans in March.   But the 24-hour stock market is not a universal vision. It hasnot been a goal publicly pursued by the New York Stock Exchange,for example, although the nation's biggest stock market suggestedthis past week it was considering a way to trade stockselectronically when the floor is closed.   ``To the extent that a customer has a need in the off-hours,this institution has a commitmenmt to meet that need,'' RichardGrasso, NYSE president and chief operating officer, told the WallStreet Journal.   The electronic-trading movement is a response to theincreasingly global nature of financial investing. The smaller theworld gets, the greater the search becomes among exchanges for waysto capture business from overseas.   The Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which averages 1 million tradesper day compared with 170 million per day on the New York StockExchange, turned totally automated in 1976.   Other U.S. exchanges have computerized parts of their operationsbut thus far the switch to automated execution, which many see as aprerequisite to 24-hour trading, has been carried on exclusively byforeign exchanges. The Toronto Stock Exchange, the Tokyo StockExchange and a host of European financial markets use computers toexecute at least part of their orders.   Chicago's commodity futures and options exchanges have recentlytaken the electronic-trading lead in the United States. The ChicagoBoard Options Exchange owns a controlling interest in theCincinnati Stock Exchange; the Chicago Mercantile Exchange willlaunch its after-hours automated-execution system, called Globex,this fall in partnership with Reuters; and the Chicago Board ofTrade, the world's largest futures market, is working on an unusualhybrid trading system called Aurora, designed to recreate on acomputer screen the characteristics of a commodities trading pit.   ``It's so obvious that this is coming, 24-hours-a-day electronictrading, everywhere. It's just a matter of time.'' said PeterSchwartz, president of Global Business Network, a small researchand consulting company based in Emeryville, Calif., that helped theLondon Stock Exchange develop a computerization strategy.   But Eric K. Clemons, an associate professor at the University ofPennsylvania's Wharton School specializing in computer andfinancial issues, says that while the New York Stock Exchangeprobably could convert successfully to round-the-clock trading, itwould require a massive investment in new technology and ``I don'tsee it as an improvement over what the exchange has today.''   What the New York Stock Exchange has today is an electronicdelivery system that routes orders to the exchange floor, wherethey are handled by professional market makers called specialists.   ``It's almost a cybernetic system, a man-machine synthesis, andI think it works very well,'' Clemons said.   Proponents of electronic trading say the specialist system forstock trading, the raucous open-outcry auction tradition of thecommodity markets and virtually every other trading system in whichhumans execute customer orders will inevitably be replaced bycomputers that can perform the same task faster and cheaper whilekeeping flawless records.   ``I don't see how you're going to stop the march of technologyany more than the people who made slide rules stopped the march ofcomputers,'' said Junius Peake, a capital markets expert at thePeake-Ryerson Consulting Group Inc. of Englewood, N.J.   Sophisticated institutional investors face an ever-expandingsmorgasbord of opportunities. They trade U.S. stocks in New York,currency futures in Chicago, yen bonds in Tokyo, British pounds inLondon.   Financial markets have responded by broadening their ownofferings to include products that once were traded only in theirhome countries. Stocks such as IBM, General Motors and MatsushitaElectric have become ``world class'' stocks, traded on exchangesboth at home and abroad.   Still, Japanese investors prefer to trade IBM in New York andmost American players want to trade Matsushita in Tokyo because themarkets for those stocks are larger at home than abroad.   The more players there are in a given market, the more likely aninvestor is to find someone willing to take the opposite side ofhis trade at the price he wants. This is called market liquidity,and investors tend to trade in the most liquid market available.   But the most liquid market is not always open. When it's morningin Tokyo, it's evening in New York. So Japanese investors seekingto trade IBM in New York, where they are likely to get the bestdeal, must wait for the New York Stock Exchange to open.   A 24-hour electronic trading system would provide easy access tothe market, but critics say there is no guarantee of liquidity.With no specialists on hand to take the opposing side of the trade,the order would dangle there, waiting for an opposing order toarrive.   That's not what investors seek in a market.   ``Liquidity follows liquidity and people don't trade wherepeople don't trade,'' Clemons said.   Thus, the greatest challenge facing electronic markets is simplygetting enough people to use them.   Reuters, which has 170,000 computer terminals in use by tradersand brokers worldwide, has been highly successful in getting peopleto use its electronic products, which range from price-quotationmachines to an off-exchange trading network called Instinet.   But spokesman Robert Crooke said human behavior, not technology,will ultimately determine the shape of tomorrow's financial markets.   ``Each system, whether completely automated, partially automatedor in fact fully human, has its advantages and its place, and thatplace will always be dictated by the markets themselves,'' Crookesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, April 23</NOTE></DOC>
