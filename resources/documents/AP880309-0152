ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush stood within reach of the Republicanpresidential nomination today after a sweep of Super Tuesdayprimaries. Democrats Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson split a richharvest of delegates with Albert Gore Jr., who declared today``it's a three-man race'' after thrashing Richard Gephardt in theSouth.   ``It exceeded my fondest expectations,'' exulted Bush as hesurveyed his 16-0 primary shutout Tuesday and looked ahead to anIllinois showdown next Tuesday, where another victory over KansasSen. Bob Dole would give his nomination an aura of inevitability.   White House chief of staff Howard Baker, himself once acandidate, said of Bush, ``I think it would take a major event todeny him the nomination.'' But there was no sign President Reaganwas ready to endorse him or another candidate, he said.   Super Tuesday spelled disaster for Dole, fellow Republican PatRobertson, and Gephardt, all three teetering on the verge ofelimination after rejection in state after state. Robertson did winthe party's caucuses in Washington state on Tuesday.   Almost certain to pack it in was Republican Jack Kemp, who wasmeeting with advisers to see if there was any point in continuing.Kemp, who got no better than 7 percent of the vote in any ofTuesday's primaries, scheduled no announcement today about hisplans, but a spokeswoman said he would have a news conferenceThursday.   In Nashville, Tenn., today, Gore dismissed the chances ofGephardt. ``It's a three-man race, no question about it,'' Goresaid on NBC-TV. The Tennessee senator, who won his own state andfour other Southern primaries, said ``all three of us are going allthe way to California and probably to the convention.''   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, who won the two biggest Southernstates, Florida and Texas, made television appearances fromChicago, where he was already campaigning.   ``I've always felt that ... this will go right down to the lastprimaries in California and New Jersey,'' he said on CBS-TV.   Jackson, who won in five Southern states, said at a Houston newsconference today his results show he is a serious contender.   ``In these elections we are removing those doubts. ... Ourcoalition represents the future of the Democratic Party,'' he said.   Robertson, at a news conference in Atlanta today, said, ``Noneof us could have dreamed that he (Bush) could be so strong. Themantle of Ronald Reagan has passed to George Bush.''   But, he said, ``It isn't over yet. ... Still half of thedelegates are to be selected.''   Robertson had hoped to do well in the South but won only theWashington caucuses, which represent an early stage in that state'sdelegate selection. Still, he said he believed he was ``making aprofound change in American politics'' and he planned to continuehis cause beyond this year's election.   Dole acknowledged he took a whipping. Campaigning today inChicago, he said, ``It will be up to Illinois now to turn itaround.''   The delegate total dramatically spelled out how Bush dominatedthe day.   With 712 Republican convention delegates at stake, Bush won 578,giving him 705 when combined with the delegates he won in earliercontests. Dole had 98, for a total of 163. Robertson gained 9delegates for a total of 17. Kemp picked up four for a total of 39.The remainder will be apportioned as the final few votes arecounted.   It takes 1,139 to gain the Republican nomination at the partyconvention in New Orleans in August.   On the Democratic side, with 1,307 national convention delegatesat stake in 21 contests, the race looked like this:   Dukakis won 386 for a total of 455.5; Jackson picked up 366,giving him a total of 393.55; and Gore took 326 for a total of347.8. Gephardt picked up 93 delegates for a total of 143, whileGary Hart failed to pick up a delegate.   It takes 2,082 to gain the Democratic nomination at the partyconvention in Atlanta this summer.   Super Tuesday was designed by Southern Democrats hoping for amore conservative candidate that they believed could avoid thedisasters which have befallen the Democrats in four of the lastfive presidential elections.   But the massive schedule _ 20 Democratic and 17 Republicancontests _ appeared to offer an advantage to the best financedcandidates or, in the case of Jackson, the one who had the mostsolid base in the region.   While Jackson was far outspent by his rivals, he received morethan 90 percent of the black vote in the South, according to exitpolls, which said he won as much as 10 percent of the white vote _more than twice as much as his 1984 showing among whites.   With 96 percent of precincts reporting, the popular vote fromthe Democratic primaries was Jackson 2,493,700, Dukakis 2,439,856,Gore 2,431,306, Gephardt 1,204,585, Hart 276,594, and Illinois Sen.Paul Simon 179,580.   With 93 percent of the Republican precincts reporting, thetotals were Bush 2,584,238, Dole 1,095,419, Robertson 582,730, andKemp 218,136.   While Bush towered over his Republican rivals after the biggestday in primary election history, the Democrats still were a partyin search of a clear leader.   Super Tuesday gave them three and left Gephardt on shaky ground.Democrats will hold caucuses on Saturday in South Carolina, whereGephardt, Jackson and Gore are the principal contenders, and thenmove on to Illinois for next Tuesday's primary.   Gephardt, already hurting for money, said he will concentratescarce resources on Michigan rather than Illinois, where favoriteson Simon is making a last stand. Michigan's Democratic caucuseswill take place March 26.   ``I never told you it was going to be easy,'' Gephardt toldsupporters in St. Louis. He said the 20-state Super Tuesdaylandscape was just too broad for his financially pressed campaign.   Robertson's political base among fundamentalist Christians wassimply too narrow, and he failed once again to win a primary. Evenin his home state of Virginia, he finished third.   Dukakis proved he could attract Southern votes with victories inTexas and Florida to add to majorities in Rhode Island, Marylandand his home state of Massachusetts. He also was an easy winner inIdaho's Democratic caucuses, and topped the field in Hawaii'scaucuses also.   Jackson carried Alabama, Georgia, Lousiana, Mississippi andVirginia.   Gore, the Tennessee senator who gambled all on a Southernstrategy, came out a winner though he still needs to prove hisappeal north of the Mason-Dixon Line. Gore carried Arkansas,Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee and was leading inNevada.</TEXT></DOC>
