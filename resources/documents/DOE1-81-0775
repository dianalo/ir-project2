In recent years, federal policymakersin the executive branch and Congress have questioned the need for publicprograms to develop, manage, or even protect the nation's forests. Manystates also are examining their funding for forestry programs, and severalhave enacted significant budget cuts. Forestry budgets are unlikely toimprove any time soon, and the scrutiny of public programs is apt tocontinue and perhaps intensify - both at the state and national level.In today's climate, what should be the role of public programs and policyin maintaining and developing forest resources? Can the marketplace effectivelyproduce and allocate forest resources? If not, should public funds bespent to improve marketplace outcomes or are imperfect markets stillsuperior to less than perfect government programs? These questions areaddressed in this article.</TEXT></DOC>
