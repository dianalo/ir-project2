Although he hasn't ``counted noses,'' Sen. James Exon of Nebraskasaid in an interview there are other committee members who feel ashe does. Exon said he had been troubled by allegations about theformer Texas senator's drinking and dealings with women, as well ashis financial involvement, but he made up his mind Tuesday.   Exon said his decision came in the evening after an FBI reportthat had been promised was further delayed because of a new,unspecified allegation. Exon said he was also angry at how the WhiteHouse handled what was supposed to have been the final FBI report.   ``I really came to that decision tonight after, or about, thetime that the FBI report was delayed and after the shenanigans oftoday,'' Exon said. ``I can tell you we're not going to vote on thisuntil we get what looks like the final report.''   Exon said he was concerned with the ``perception'' that Tower``has not recovered from what obviously was a drinking problem atone time,'' and about potential conflicts of interest stemming fromTower's dealings with defense contractors.   According to Wednesday's editions of The New York Times,President Bush called Tower on Tuesday evening to discuss theallegations against him. Also, the Times reported that theallegations had to do with Tower's financial dealings.   Because of the latest allegations since the FBI firstinvestigated Tower, a report from the agency isn't expected forseveral days, Exon and others said. Congress is taking a week'srecess next week. If the panel votes to approve Tower, thatrecommendation would then go to the full Senate.   Exon wouldn't tell The Associated Press whether Sen. Sam Nunn,D-Ga., the panel's chairman, is opposed to the nomination, althoughboth CBS and the Times said he was. Nunn was neither at home nor hisoffice when the AP tried to reach him.   At a news conference, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the rankingRepublican on the committee, said White House counsel C. Boyden Graytold him of the new charge but he was ``not advised'' of thespecifics.   Nunn's office issued a statement saying: ``The FBI report has notbeen delivered to the committee. ... I am informed it has not beencompleted.''   Earlier, Nunn said he had lingering concerns about allegationsagainst Tower, but GOP senators said a preliminary FBI reportprovides no grounds to disqualify Tower.   Warner said he was briefed by the White House and, in turn,briefed the GOP members of the committee about the latest FBIinquiry into the allegations.   Warner said the preliminary report ``provides, at the judgment ofWhite House counsel, no basis on which senators could find thefactual situation that would amount to any disqualification.''   Exon said, however, he never received the report on which theRepublicans were briefed. He then said he found out the report wasnot finished.   The committee last Thursday put off a vote on whether torecommend full Senate confirmation and asked the FBI to review theallegations.   At the White House, Bush met with Nunn and Warner for about 45minutes _ a meeting requested by the committee chairman, accordingto Warner. The Tower nomination was among the topics discussed,Warner said.   In the meeting with Nunn, Bush reiterated his support for Tower.   ``The president told him Tower was an excellent nominee and hopedthere'd be a vote soon,'' said presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater. ``He (Nunn) did not speak out against it or ask that itbe withdrawn.''   Warner said he has asked that Nunn be briefed by the White Houseand the full committee assemble to see the written FBI report whenit is finished.   But Nunn expressed irritation at not being informed about thebriefing to Warner. ``Obviously, there have been some unofficialbriefings going on that I as chairman of the committee have not beenpart of,'' he said.   Nunn said he won't be satisfied with an oral report. ``I like toread the answers and reflect on them. You have to put the wholepicture together and make your conclusions from it.''   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., emerging from a luncheon meeting ofDemocratic senators, said Nunn had told senators that cooperationinside the panel was ``breaking down on partisan lines.''   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed Servicescommittee, said all the charges ``that I know of were withoutsubstance.''   ``We can't have an open-ended situation where we're going to waituntil all the allegations are in. We have to have a vote,'' he said.   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is not a member of the committee,said there was an impression among GOP senators that ``there may bean underlying attempt to delay the nomination.''   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who attended the briefing withWarner, said: ``There has been no substantiation of the major chargewhich prompted the new investigation.''   ``Republicans think it's time to vote,'' Cohen added.   But Nunn said all allegations have to be considered, saying thecommittee would look foolish if more charges surfaced after acursory review of the charges.   Warner, as he emerged from a meeting with Senate Minority LeaderBob Dole, R-Kan., and GOP members of the panel, said he expects thepanel to vote after it reviews the report. He did not provide aspecific time.   ``It is my expectation the committee will find, as I have found,that the evidence in part one, two, three, four and now part five,which will be made available, does not provide a basis for anydisqualification,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
