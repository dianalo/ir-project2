You ask rhetorically, &quot;What more can Turkey do?&quot; The answer: plenty.    For starters, Turkish state security officials could stop torturing people. Prime Minister Ozal has been in power for four years, yet Amnesty International continues to receive regular reports from all parts of Turkey, from men and women who have been brutally tortured by government interrogators to force confessions about their beliefs or activities. Eleven Turks died in custody during the first six months of 1987. Nine were allegedly tortured to death, clearly a sign that the problem continues. The Turkish government admits they are holding 15,500 political prisoners. Amnesty International has recognized several hundred of these as &quot;prisoners of conscience,&quot; men and women who have been jailed because they dared to express peacefully their religious beliefs or their political opinions. Hundreds more are now on trial before military courts that fail to meet any standards of fairness for the defendants.    The Wall Street Journal touts the recent Turkish election as &quot;open, free and robust&quot; but willfully ignores the fate of Dr. Nihat Sargin, leader of the Turkish Workers Party, and Haydar Kutlu, leader of the Turkish Communist Party. Both men had returned from exile with hopes of participating in the election but were instead imprisoned as soon as they landed in Turkey. After being held incommunicado for 19 days, the two men were charged with &quot;propaganda,&quot; &quot;belonging to illegal organizations&quot; and &quot;insulting state authorities.&quot;    Should they be convicted, the maximum sentence could add up to 70 years imprisonment. When they finally were allowed to meet their lawyers, both Dr. Sargin, a 61-year-old heart specialist, and Mr. Kutlu reported they had been stripped naked, beaten, hung and subjected to electric shocks by their interrogators. When their lawyers relayed these complaints, they themselves were detained. Openness? Leaders who seek to peacefully participate in the political process should not face a lifetime in prison. Robust? The clinical term is torture.    Your editorialist goes on to repeat a familiar geography lesson and stresses Turkey's strategic value to the West. The fact that Turkey is a U.S. military ally should not blind us to its violations of human rights. As General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev heard from President Reagan in Washington, the U.S. holds every nation accountable to protect the rights of its citizens. Those who believe that torture is an abuse of dignity should ask no less of Prime Minister Ozal's government.    John G. Healey   Executive Director   Amnesty International USA   New York   ---   Your editorial would be much more credible if you presented all the facts in an objective and balanced manner. You make no mention of the 35,000 Turkish troops that since 1974 have illegally -- and contrary to the NATO Charter and international law -- occupied 40% of the Republic of Cyprus, or the 65,000 Turks whom Turkey has settled on that island to change its demographic composition. You mention the Turkish divisions poised on the Russian border, but no mention of the Turkish divisions holding 10 million Kurds in subjugation or the many Turkish divisions and tanks deployed on the Greek border and along Turkey's Aegean coast posing a military threat against its NATO ally. Nor do you call upon Turkey to end its notorious human-rights violations, for which it has been cited year after year by Amnesty International, Helsinki Watch and the Council of Europe.    In urging the nations of the world to treat Turkey kindly, it would be appropriate also for you to insist that Turkey conduct itself as a Western democracy by observing human rights and fairly treating the minorities within its borders, removing its invasion forces occupying Cyprus and ceasing its warlike threats against Greece. This is what Turgut Ozal can do.    Evan A. Chriss   Baltimore</TEXT></DOC>
