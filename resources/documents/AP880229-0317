Inc. announced Monday it hasagreed to be acquired in a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout by theinvestment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc., but Dart Group Corp.said the news will not deter its attempt to gain control of theretailer.   Stop andamp; Shop said a Kohlberg Kravis subsidiary, SSC HoldingsCorp., will purchase at least 66 percent of the 28 millionoutstanding Stop andamp; Shop shares at $44 each.   If all outstanding stock were purchased, the leveraged buyoutwould total $1.23 billion. In a leveraged buyout, investors borrowheavily to buy out a company and then pay off the debt with thetarget company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.   Dart, which launched the hostile takeover bid in January,extended until March 9 an offer of $37 a share for all outstandingStop andamp; Shop stock and indicated it planned to go ahead with a proxyfight to replace Stop andamp; Shop directors later this month.   Dart spokesman Jeffrey Gast said the Landover, Md.-based firmplanned to continue the cash tender offer past March 9 on a day today basis.   However, Harry Wells, an analyst at Adams, Harkness andamp; Hill inBoston, said it was unlikely Dart could match the $44 a share offer.   ``I think it's over,'' said Wells. ``You've got to be able tosupport the debt with some level of safety ... and ($44) is aboutas much as one can reasonably afford to pay (for Stop andamp; Shop).''   Stop andamp; Shop has rejected as inadequate Dart's $1.03 billionoffer and filed suit in federal court, seeking to block Dart.   A countersuit filed by Dart claiming Stop andamp; Shop illegallywithheld corporate information was rejected last week by U.S.District Court Judge Rya Zobel, who ordered that the suit must befiled in state courts.   Dart, which purchased nearly 730,000 shares through itsJefferson Acquisition Corp. subsidiary, announced Feb. 26 itreceived approval from at least 10 percent of Stop andamp; Shopshareholders to call a special shareholders meeting on March 30.   At the meeting, Dart wants to remove the Stop andamp; Shop board andreplace it with Jefferson nominees.   Under the deal with Kohlberg Kravis, Stop andamp; Shop said it willretain its present management and remain based in Braintree.   The sale, which must be approved by a majority of Stop andamp; Shopshareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission, isexpected to commence on or before March 4, Stop andamp; Shop said.Kohlberg Kravis has received a financing commitment fromManufacturers Hanover Trust Co., the retailer said.   Other companies reportedly have been interested in Stop andamp; Shop,including Thomas H. Lee Co. of Boston, and Riordan, Freeman andamp;Spogli Inc. of Los Angeles.   Stop andamp; Shop has 113 supermarkets and 169 Bradlees in 12 statesin the Northeast.   The company's stock has gone up more than $25 a share since Dartfirst announced its takeover intent in January. It rose 87{ cents ashare in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, closing at $43.50.   Dart is known for a series of unsuccessful but profitable bidsto gain control of other companies, and its chairman, Herbert Haft,and president, Robert Haft, have acquired reputations as corporateraiders.   In its most recent bid, Dart dropped an attempt forMinneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. following the October stockmarket crash.   Other Dart takeover attempts include a 1986 bid for Safeway Co.and Supermarkets General last year.   Kohlberg Kravis, which acquired Safeway following the failedDart bid, has conducted about 33 leveraged buyouts since forming in1976, including a $6.2 billion deal that took Beatrice Cos. privatein 1986.   Last week, Kohlberg Kravis acquired New York-based SeamanFurniture Co. for $350 million. In July 1987, the firm obtainedcontrol of Jim Walter Co., a Florida construction materialmanufacturer.</TEXT></DOC>
