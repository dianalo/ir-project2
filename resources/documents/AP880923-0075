Eleven guerrillas were killed and 11 soldiers were wounded inthe attack Thursday in eastern Morazan province, according to acommunique issued by the Armed Forces Press Office.   The raid on the army post began an hour after guerrillas lifteda road traffic ban that had paralyzed most transportationnationwide since Monday. In lifting the ban, the rebels called onsupporters to step up sabotage of vehicles that had ignored themeasure.   Marxist-led rebels of the Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront have fought the the U.S.-backed centrist government fornearly nine years. About 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have beenkilled.   Lt. Salvador Gonzalez said the attack began at 1 a.m. withrebels firing mortar rounds and charges of TNT into acommunications post on Avocado Hill, north of Corinto, 120 milesnortheast of San Salvador.   Gonzalez, spokesman for the 3rd Army Brigade, said the rebelsused catapults, similar to those used in medieval times, to launchexplosives into the base defended by about 50 men. The guerrillasthen attacked with rifle fire, he said.   Gonzalez spoke by telephone from San Miguel, headquarters formilitary operations in the eastern third of this small CentralAmerican country.   The guerrillas also stepped up their sabotage of powertransmission lines in several of El Salvador's 14 provinces.   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said the ban _ thefifth this year _ was lifted at midnight Wednesday. Bus and trucktraffic returned to normal Thursday.   At least three vehicles were burned during the ban, whichreduced bus and truck traffic in the capital by about 70 percent.Traffic on provincial highways was almost completely halted.   Some buses and trucks that operated since Monday covered theirlicense plates trying to avoid reprisals.   The guerrillas blew up about 35 utility posts or high-tensiontowers after the transport ban began, military sources said. Foureastern provinces were without electricity early Thursday becauseof overnight sabotage.</TEXT></DOC>
