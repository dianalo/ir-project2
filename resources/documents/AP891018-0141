The Democrat-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, on an 8-6vote, approved the measure Tuesday.   The move angered Turkey, which had waged a full-scale lobbyingcampaign to kill the measure in committee. The NATO ally, whichreceives about $500 million in U.S. aid a year, sees the resolutionas tantamount to a comparison with Hitler's regime in Germany.   ``Now we've got to concentrate on 100 people,'' said MikeMcNamara, a lobbyist for Turkey. No date has been set for fullconsideration by the Senate.   Turkey was aided in its campaign by the administration, whichsummoned the American ambassador from Ankara to help work againstthe measure. Publicly, however, the State Department did notannounce its opposition to the resolution until after the vote.   ``The bottom line is that we oppose it,'' Roman Popadiuk, aWhite House spokesman, said late Tuesday.   Before the panel passed the measure, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,D-Ohio, tried unsuccessfully to soften it by eliminating the word``genocide.''   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, suggested thechange, Metzenbaum said. He sought to replace the word genocidewith a ``national day of remembrance'' for Armenians.   ``Whether or not it is a genocide is arguable,'' Metzenbaumsaid, discussing the reported deaths of 1.5 million Armenians inthe Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923.   Armenians, the bulk of whom now live within Soviet borders, havea long history of ethnic and religious conflict with Turks. Turkeyclaims hundreds of thousands of people, not 1.5 million, died fromwar, famine and epidemics during the war years and that many Turkswere among them.   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,said, ``The only debate is whether it was attempted genocide orgenocide.'' Moreover, Biden said Turkey's opposition to theresolution was irrelevant.   ``The fact that the government of Turkey opposes it is of noconsequence,'' he said.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., argued genocide did occur. ``Peoplewere massacred because of their ancestry,'' in the Ottoman Empire,he said.   The measure, sponsored by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole ofKansas, aroused strong feelings among Americans of Turkish andArmenian descent.   ``I became the focal point for the greatest lobbying campaignI've experience in a long while,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.   The Dole measure would set April 24, 1990 to memorialize the 1.5million Armenians who were killed between 1915 and 1923 during thedays of the Ottoman Empire.   Although the Bush administration opposes it, President Bushvoiced support for language marking the ``Armenian genocide''during the 1988 campaign.   The Reagan administration opposed similiar resolutions when theycame before the House in past years. None of those passed.</TEXT></DOC>
