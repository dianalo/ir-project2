Mexico's Bolsa de Valores, one of the fastest growingstock markets in the world through most of this year, hasgone into a funk ever since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Theinfluential chief of the Mexican Senate's energy commisionspoke dismissively about &quot;rarely reliable&quot; fluctuations inthe oil markets. Employees of the state oil monopoly,Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, still talk as skeptically asthough oil prices were in full retreat. &quot;You can't count onwhat's happening in the Middle East to improve things inMexico,&quot; says Javier Gomez, a Pemex office worker.</LP><TEXT>   After nearly a decade of economic crisis triggered bysinking oil prices, why aren't Mexicans toasting their suddengusher of good luck? For one thing, many Mexicans are worriedthat rising oil prices will be the last straw that leads to arecession in the U.S., the major market for Mexico'smanufactured exports and biggest source of Mexico's foreigninvestment. The Middle East crisis has also pricked a softspot in the Mexican psyche -- the country's complicatedattitude toward oil.   &quot;This has always been an oil country that doesn't thinklike an oil country,&quot; says Jorge Diaz Serrano, who went fromthe Pemex chief executive's suite during the oil boom of the1970s to a penitentiary cell during the debt bust of the1980s. Mr. Diaz Serrano spent five years in jail after beingconvicted for embezzling $34 million from the government.   Foreign refiners, seeing oil reserves in Mexico that someconsider the equal of those in Saudi Arabia, certainly thinkof Mexico as an oil country. Scrambling for crude supplies inthe hours after the Iraqi invasion, they quickly found theirway to Pemex, the fifth-biggest oil company in the world. ButPemex's capital budget has been so constrained since the debtcrisis that the company could manage only a temporaryincrease of 100,000 barrels in its daily 1.2 million-barrelexport output.   Still, if the rise in world oil prices sticks -- as itwell might with U.S. and Iraqi soldiers digging in --Mexico's balance of payments could be substantiallystrengthened. If prices hold at $25 a barrel, Mexico earns anextra $14 million a day above budget estimates, or anadditional $2 billion through year end. The extra cash couldhardly come at a better time. The government's policy oftearing down trade borders and stabilizing the exchange ratehas caused imports to almost double since 1987. This year'sdeficit in the current account, the broadest measure oftrade, may reach as much as $6 billion.   But higher oil prices could also have some less beneficialeffects on Mexico's economy. Since oil prices collapsed inthe early 1980s, Mexico has made a great effort to promotemanufactured exports as an alternative source of foreignexchange. Now, 65% of Mexico's export income is derived fromsales of manufactured goods and 35% from sales of oil, almostthe reverse of the proportion in 1985.   &quot;Mexicans didn't celebrate these oil price increases forvery long, because they soon began to worry about what wouldhappen to manufactured exports if our major market {the U.S.}fell into an oil recession,&quot; says Jorge Vazquez Costilla, aneconomist at Grupo Visa S.A., a huge conglomerate.   Felipe Pablo Martinez, chief of a large Mexican shoeexporter, Emyco S.A., got a sense of an impending U.S.economic crunch at a shoe fair in New York two weeks ago.&quot;All the buyers were depressed and complaining about how badthings look,&quot; he says. Yet Mr. Martinez had no troublegetting U.S. retailers to check out his moderately pricedproduct. &quot;There are many Mexican exporters like us, that haveniches that look more attractive during a recession thanduring a boom,&quot; he says.   Middle-market exporters like Mr. Martinez, along with theextra oil revenue, ought to get Mexico through a U.S.recession in fair shape, according to Mauro Leos, vicepresident of operations of Wharton Econometric ForecastingAssociates in Philadelphia. Mr. Leos does think a U.S.downturn might hit some Mexican industries pretty hard,particularly the automobile industry, a big producer of jobsand foreign exchange for Mexico.   Yet &quot;Mexico seems to end up with more dollars with higheroil prices in most of the scenarios we've examined,&quot; Mr. Leossays. Mexico would be a loser, he says, only if a U.S.recession is far deeper than most analysts consider likely.   That being the case, some say Mexico's subdued response tothe oil-price rebound has more to do with psychology theneconomics. In Mexico, oil has always been freighted withsymbolic significance -- what Mr. Diaz Serrano calls &quot;theblack legend.&quot; It has never been viewed as just anothercommodity.   After buccaneering foreign petroleum companies werenationalized in 1938, oil became a symbol of Mexicannationalism. When prices shot up during the late 1970s, oilwas viewed as Mexico's ticket to the First World. Today,Mexicans think of oil as the catalyst for a recklessgovernment's borrowing binge that brought about Mexico'sworst economic crisis since the Great Depression.   That last view will be slow to change. &quot;In the late '70sthe president told Mexicans that the country's only challengewas `administering the abundance.' It was like Santa Claus,&quot;says Federico San Roman, a psychiatrist and political writer.&quot;Today, the government is being very austere in its responseto higher prices. It probably knows that, by now, people willbelieve it only when they see it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
