However, Cavazos said the Bush administration supports the goalsof the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, whichplans to start offering the certificates in 1993 to qualifiedapplicants who make it through a rigorous evaluation process.   Board members believe their plan ultimately will upgrade teachertraining and the profession in general, open doors to new roles andpossibly higher pay for certified teachers, and improve thelearning environment for children.   ``The board currently operates with total independence from thefederal government. And that, in my judgment, is the way it oughtto remain,'' Cavazos told the House Education and Laborsubcommittee on postsecondary education.   The 63-member board, made up of teachers, other educators,government officials and prominent business leaders, is asking for$25 million from Congress to help fund its research into standardsand assessment methods. Business executives have said they willmatch that amount but cannot hope to raise more.   ``These private leaders say they consider it imperative that ournational government provide a one-time appropriation of $25 millionthat the private sector will match,'' said board chairman JamesHunt, a former governor of North Carolina.   In a statement submitted to the panel, Hunt said anything lessthan $50 million would result in piecemeal reform rather than thebroad effort needed to help the board ``do the job right.''   Cavazos cited three major concerns: the board lacksaccountability to the education secretary, the money requested isexcessive and would likely duplicate department research, and thedepartment opposes sole-source contracts awarded withoutcompetition.   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said he could think of better ways touse $25 million if the objective is to attract more and betterteachers. ``We should put our priorities in order,'' he said,adding he would prefer to see the money used to forgive loans forstudents who agree to teach in poor areas.   But others on the subcommittee said they wanted to find a middleground.   ``These people want to do something for this country and I don'twant to turn them off,'' said Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo.   He suggested that the board itself award research grantscompetitively and submit to oversight by Congress and thedepartment. He also said the $25 million, if deemed excessive,could be reduced.   Subcommittee chairman Pat Williams, D-Mont., said Coleman'ssuggestions appeared to offer ``some room here for some type of acoming together. ... Is there room to work with theadministration?''   Cavazos said he would enter into discussions with an open mind.But he said he could not support the request as currentlystructured and invited the board to apply for money on the samecompetitive basis that other federal grants are awarded.   Witnesses for the American Association of School Administratorsand the Council of Chief State School Officers said they favoredthe federal appropriation as long as the board required competitivebidding and peer reviews for research contracts and the $25 milliondid not come from other federal education programs.   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has approved theboard's $25 million request as part of an omnibus education billthat also includes President Bush's proposals for several neweducation programs. The bill is expected to come to the floor inSeptember.</TEXT></DOC>
