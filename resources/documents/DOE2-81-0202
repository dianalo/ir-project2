Unlike these other rotational viscometers,the HSR response to rotation rate is measured in terms of pressure droprather than torque. Access to a bank of multi-range pressure transducersexternal to the HSR provides a means for obtaining wide rangability withthis device. To achieve similar rangability with a conventional rotationalviscometer, it would be necessary to change the torque transducer, whichis often an integral part of the instruments.</TEXT></DOC>
