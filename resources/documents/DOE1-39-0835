Research continuous coal liquefaction unit.Dependable delivery of methanol wood slurry to the high pressure reactorwas a serious problem during the initial stage of this investigation.It was solved by streamlining feed lines and diluting the slurry to 5weight percent wood. The respective yields of liquid products isolatedwere 70 and 51% based on dry wood while the yields of gas were 6 and31% and water were 3 andamp; 1%. Conversions of 93-94% based upon ash balancesshowed no significant differences due to hydrogen addition. Limited materialbalance data of 94 and 83% were insufficient for accurate economic evaluationof the process. The products showed significant chemical and physicaldifferences. The hydrogen:carbon ratio decreased from 1.52 to 1.44 withhydrogen addition, while the viscosity increased and the methoxyl contenddecreased. Thermogravimetric data showed that hydrogen addition decreasedvolatility in the 100-400/sup 0/C range. However, neither densities,non-distillable residues, nor heating values were significantly affectedby hydrogen addition.</TEXT></DOC>
