The recommendations, which are subject to provincial government approval, were sharply criticized by Nova Corp. of Alberta, a gas pipeline and petrochemical producer. The company said if the recommendations are implemented the cost of ethane will rise, and it and other companies will abandon plans to invest as much as two billion Canadian dollars ($1.62 billion) in petrochemicals plants.    Ethane, a hydrocarbon found with natural gas, is used to produce ethylene, a material that in turn is used to make polyethylene plastics, antifreeze and other petrochemical products. Alberta government officials said they expect to make a final decision on the issue within a few months.    Nova's Alberta Gas Ethylene Co. subsidiary is the only producer of ethylene in Alberta. The unit operates two plants and has proposed immediate construction of a third plant and related facilities to make polyethylene.    &quot;If these recommendations were adopted by the government of Alberta, Nova and its customers couldn't proceed with the proposed third ethylene plant project and its attendant derivative investment,&quot; the company said. It added that the proposed policy changes would eventually &quot;seriously damage&quot; existing ethane-based plants.    Currently, most Alberta ethane is extracted from natural gas at &quot;straddle plants&quot; alongside major pipelines. The ethane is purchased by Alberta Gas Ethylene on a confidential, &quot;cost of service&quot; basis that allows payment only for the heating value of the ethane and the cost of extracting it. Alberta Gas Ethylene in turn sells its ethylene on cost of service basis to manufacturers, including a polyethylene producing unit of Nova. The final products are sold at market prices.    Some natural gas producers opposed a continuation of the policy because they want to extract ethane at field plants near the wellhead and sell the product as a solvent for enhanced oil recovery projects.    A spokesman for Nova said that in addition to the current costs, Alberta Gas Ethylene would have to make payments to natural gas producers to prevent them from extracting ethane for their own purposes. Under current policy, such extraction for their own use is restricted by the government.    The Alberta government agency's recommendations followed an inquiry that began last year. The agency said Alberta will be able to produce sufficient ethane to meet the requirements of enhanced oil recovery projects and petrochemicals development.    Alberta Gas Ethylene currently produces about 3 billion pounds of ethylene annually, or 7.5% of North America's supply. The proposed expansion would add about 1.5 billion pounds of production annually, boosting the company's share of North American supply to 10%.    On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Nova's stock closed yesterday at 11.625 dollars, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
