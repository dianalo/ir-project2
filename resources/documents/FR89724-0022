Section 301(a) requires that all fishery management plans(FMPs) and implementing regulations be consistent with the standards. Section301(b) of the Act requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to issueadvisory guidelines, based on the standards, to assist in the developmentand review of FMPs, their amendments, and implementing regulations. Theguidelines are intended to improve the quality of FMPs by providing comprehensiveguidance for Regional Fishery Management Councils (Councils) to use indeveloping FMPs and amendments, and to produce a more uniform understandingof the Secretary's basis for FMP review and implementation. The originalguidelines were issued in February 1983. This rule revises the guidelines for national standards l and 2 only. Standard1, as set forth in the Act, requires conservation and management measuresto prevent ``overfishing'' while achieving ``optimum yield'' (OY) on acontinuing basis. Standard 2 requires conservation and management measuresto be based on the best scientific information available. The Act does not define overfishing, nor do most FMPs. Further, the biologicaldata necessary to determine overfishing has sometimes been unavailable.As a result, Councils have often made decisions based primarily on short-termeconomic and political considerations, with lesser emphasis placed on thelong-term viability of the fishery resource or the fishing industry. Inorder to assure that the Councils give appropriate decisional weight tolong-term viability, the revised guidelines stipulate that: (1) Each existingand future FMP specify, to the maximum extent possible, an objective andmeasurable definition of overfishing for each managed stock or stock complex,with an analysis of how the definition was determined and how it relatesto biological potential; and (2) the Secretary is responsible for assuringthat a Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report is preparedand updated as necessary, for each fishery. The SAFE report summarizesthe best available biological, economic, social, and ecological informationconcerning the past, present, and potential condition of the stock(s) andfishery being managed. The short-term effect of the revised guidelines will be that more restrictiveregulation will be necessary in those fisheries where stocks are approachingor have reached an overfished condition as defined in the FMP. The intendedlong-term effect is to assure that the reproductive capacity of any managedstock is not jeopardized, that depleted stocks are rebuilt, and that economicallyviable future harvests on a continuing basis are possible. To provide the proper context and as a convenience to the reader, thisfinal rule republishes the guidelines for the seven national standardsin their entirety, along with an updated Appendix containing explanatorymaterial.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Richard H. Schaefer, telephone:301-427-2334.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Revision of the guidelines for national standards 1 and 2 was precipitated,in part, by recommendations of the NOAA Fishery Management Study (the Study),commissioned by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphereand undertaken to assess and improve the Magnuson Act fishery managementsystem. In June 1986, the Study recommended that NOAA assume the responsibilityfor determining the biologically acceptable catch (ABC) for each managedfishery. By ABC the Study meant the total allowable removals from the resourcethat would maintain a healthy and productive resource into the future.As used in this context, the ABC would be the maximum allowable quota forthe species or species complex in the fishery. It should be noted thatthis is different from the manner in which the term ABC is used in theguidelines for national standard 1 as revised (andSection; 602.11). The Study'sintent was that stocks be maintained at some level above that which protectsthe minimum spawning stock from recruitment overfishing. The Study soughta ``conservation standard'' such that stocks are not continually drivento, or maintained at, the threshold of overfishing.In April 1987, NOAA distributed for Council/National Marine Fisheries Service(NMFS) pre-publication review and comment a draft revision of the uniformstandards governing the organization, practices, and procedures of theCouncils and the guidelines for FMPs. That draft revision included a sectionproviding that a maximum fishing mortality (MFM) be established that wouldmaintain the current spawning stock size with consideration of the variabilitiesin spawning stock estimates, and that ABC be specified so as not to exceedMFM. Again, ABC was to be used as a maximum allowable annual quota forthe fishery. Council and NOAA comments concerning the MFM proposal madeit clear that this proposal was not universally applicable for a varietyof reasons. Accordingly, in August 1987, NOAA convened a technical workshop of NOAAfishery scientists and managers, and academic scientists recommended bythe Councils, to address the Study's recommendations for a conservationstandard and the comments on the April draft. In October 1987, to allowtime for a thorough examination of the issues raised by the workshop, thedecision was made to separate the revisions concerning the conservationstandard from the revisions of the uniform standards governing the organization,practices, and procedures of the Councils. In the spring of 1988, a seriesof Council/NMFS regional workshops was held to discuss the feasibilityof the conservation standard concept, using as a basis for discussion theproposed revision of guidelines for national standards 1 and 2 producedby the August 1987 technical workshop. Following the workshops, the proposedrevision was further modified as the basis for discussion at a CouncilChairmen's meeting in July 1988. The proposed rule, published at 53 FR 53031 on December 30, 1988, thusconstituted the fourth revision_the product of intensive and iterativeCouncil/NOAA review, debate, and drafting. This internal process helpedidentify, reduce, or eliminate many policy and operational problems beforepublication of the regulatory proposal. Public comments were invited onthe proposed rule until February 28, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Issues </ITAG>Two preliminary issue discussions follow. The first reflects issues identifiedand taken into account at different times in the Council/NOAA process priorto publication of the proposed rule. The second describes the broad issuesraised by public comments received following publication of the proposedrule. Two intrinsic approaches to the proposed rule_that of the decisionmakerand that of the user groups affected by the decisions_are thus displayedtogether. Individual public comments are addressed in the separate comments-and-responsesection. 1. Issues identified in various drafts and debated at the Council/NOAAworkshops and Council Chairmen's meetings primarily derived from the needfor flexibility. It became clear (a) that no rigid or universal overfishingdefinition could be applied to the great number of diverse species undermanagement; and (b) that the ABC concept is not accepted by, or usefulto, all Councils. A few Councils expressed concern that identification of thresholds mightserve to establish targets for harvest rather than provide for protectionof resources. This concern was consistent with the need expressed by someother Councils to: (a) Identify measurable ``conditions of concern'' foreach stock, with monitoring and review procedures; (b) permit conservativeapproaches, such as establishing an optimum yield (OY) ``reserve,'' releasableto domestic or foreign fishermen as necessary, to solve operational problemsand allow for uncertainties in stock estimates; and (c) retain an abilityto take appropriate restrictive management actions at stock levels abovethe threshold. 2. Sixteen comments were received from outside NOAA: three Councils, twoStates (including two from different departments of the same State), twoFederal agencies, one commercial fishing industry association, three recreationalfishing associations, one professional association, and three individuals.The comments reflect varying approaches to, and awareness of, the changesin biological, economic, social, ecological, and political reality thathave taken place since the Act took effect. In broad terms, the issues raised by the commenters centered on the relationshipof overfishing to OY, and, by inference, to other national standards (standard3_management units, standard 4_allocations, and standard 6_variations andcontingencies). It was clear that management of bycatch (incidental take,non-targeted species) was a troublesome issue in its effect on the resource(overfishing) and on the fishery (OY). Some commenters wanted more emphasison economic measurement, on habitat, on sociological considerations, onnon-consumptive uses, or on the administrative record to support managementdecisions. The ABC concept was questioned by some and demanded by others.Timing of the Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) effort alsocaused concern. Commenters, in a few cases, may have been unfamiliar with (a) recent amendmentsto the Act, (b) the full set of guidelines (published in February 1983,codified at 50 CFR Part 602), or (c) supplementary guidance published inother than regulatory form (<T3>Operational Guidelines_the Fishery Management Process, </T3>last revisedin February 1988). Republishing the national standard guidelines in theirentirety here is intended to provide the public a fuller understandingof the interrelationships among the standards and of the broader basison which FMPs are reviewed. The statutory language of each standard ispresented as paragraph (a) under the appropriate section of the guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Approach </ITAG>Certain principles instructed the revision throughout: flexibility, integrity,consistency. In addition, it should be reiterated that the effort was generatedin response to the need, articulated by the 1986 Fishery Management Studyand others, for a conservation standard. Consequently, the emphasis wason the resource, not its allocation. The revision focused on the definitionof overfishing, not on OY. The guidelines, as revised, do not change therelationship between the two: the prevention of overfishing is an inherentlimitation on OY; however, exceeding OY does not necessarily constituteoverfishing. If a stock is in good condition, the specification of OY mayserve various goals besides prevention of overfishing. Exceeding the OYmay interfere with achievement of those goals but not affect the reproductivepotential of the stock. On the other hand, if OY is the amount of fishthat can safely be removed from the stock from a biological standpoint,exceeding OY may well constitute overfishing. The SAFE document(s) (whichwould ideally include all the types of data necessary for the determinationof OY as prescribed by the Act) is intended to provide the basis for theCouncil's treatment of the overfishing/OY relationship. Councils have alwaysbeen free to define overfishing as exceeding OY, but under the revisedguidelines an overfishing definition and its justification are subjectto review by the Secretary under the criteria described in andSection; 602.11(c)(5).The guidelines seek as much precision as possible in the use of the words``should'' and ``must''. Section 602.2(c) states that ``must'' is usedto denote an obligation to act and is used primarily when referring torequirements of the Act, the logical extension thereof, or other applicablelaw. ``Should'' is used to indicate that an action or consideration isstrongly recommended to fulfill the Secretary's interpretation of the Act,and is a factor that reviewers will look for in evaluating an FMP. The guidelines seek to provide options rather than establish requirements.Lists are not exclusive; they provide examples or illustrations of thekind of information, discussion, or examination/analysis useful in demonstratingconsistency with the standard in question. The guidelines seek to avoid universal application of a specific provision,except as required by law, so that the maximum accommodation to regionalor individual fishery characteristics can be achieved within the standards.In summary, the guidelines are intended as an aid to decisionmaking, withresponsible conservation and management of a valued national resource asthe goal. NOAA's response to the comments was (a) to maintain policy decisionsof the proposed rule since they had evolved, for the most part, from commmentsand recommendations discussed widely at various public meetings and workshops,(b) to reevaluate and try to balance divergent points of view, and (c)to clarify ambiguities. Many of the changes in the final guidelines are,in fact, refinements and clarifications, and as such, are not necessarilyaddressed individually in the body of the comments-and-response section.Section 602.11(c) was reorganized in the final rule, though not changedsubstantively. The subparagraphs under paragraph 602.11(c)(2) and the lasthalf of andSection; 602.11(c)(7) were moved to a new andSection; 602.11(c)(6)describing how an FMP must or may prescribe measures to prevent overfishingunder different circumstances. The first half of andSection; 602.11(c)(7)became andSection; 602.11(c)(3); andSection;andSection; 602.l1(c)(3)-(c)(8) wererenumbered as andSection;andSection; 602.11(c)(4)-(c)(9). The national standard guidelines published in 1983 at 50 CFR Part 602 includedexplanatory material as Appendix A to Subpart B. NOAA has chosen to republishthat Appendix here with some modification of those sections relevant tothis revision of andSection;andSection; 602.l1 and 602.12. The purpose of theAppendix is to preserve, as codified reference, useful explanatory materialand supplementary policy rationale originally published as preamble tothe various editions of proposed and final 602 rules. Preambles are notcodified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Parts of this preambleare therefore repeated in the Appendix so that the rationale for the changeswill be available in the CFR for future reference. <ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Policy </ITAG>Section 602.11 sets forth a comprehensive overfishing concept within whicheach Council must establish a specific, measurable definition of overfishingfor each stock or stock complex covered by an FMP. That concept is basedon the premise that irreversible damage to a resource's ability to recoverin a reasonable period of time is unacceptable, and that fishing on a stockat a level that severely compromises that stock's future productivity iscounter to the goals of the Act. As used in this revision, ABC is not meantas a quota for the fishery, but rather, may be used as a step in derivingOY from maximum sustainable yield (MSY). (See andSection; 602.11(e).) Inthis context, the ABC is set by a Council, not NOAA. Since the ABC conceptis not necessarily applicable to all fisheries, Councils may establishan ABC level, but are not required to do so. Councils are provided with the flexibility needed to develop a definitionof overfishing appropriate to the individual stock or species characteristics,as long as it is defined in a way that allows the Councils and the Secretaryto evaluate the condition of the stock relative to the definition. A phase-in schedule for implementation is included. General criteria areset forth as a basis for Secretarial review of the definition; these criteriaaddress the overfishing definition specifically and do not change the Secretary'sobligation to review FMPs/amendments for consistency with all the nationalstandards, the Act, and other applicable law. NOAA believes that, although it is difficult to define precisely the levelat which overfishing jeopardizes recovery of a stock, there are indicatorsof existing or impending overfishing that should be heeded. Councils areencouraged to identify such conditions. If these conditions are realizedin a particular fishery, the best scientific advice may conclude that immediateremedial action should be taken. (See Appendix A to Subpart B of the guidelinesfor a fuller discussion.) As management regimes become more comprehensive, the interrelationshipsof fishing pressures on target and non-target (major and minor) speciesneed to be addressed more directly. NOAA believes that in determining allowablefishing levels Councils should consider all sources of mortality on a stock,including non-targeted fishing, discards, and illegal catch. Because allremovals from the stock, whether landed or unlanded, will affect spawningstock biomass levels now or in the near future, the Councils should attemptto obtain estimates of all sources of mortality and consider the estimatesin adjusting directed fishing levels. Total fishing mortality on a stockshould be managed such that overfishing does not occur. (See andSection;andSection;602.11(c)(6) and (c)(7)(i).) Allowance has been made for the establishmentand release of OY reserves to accommodate uncertainties in estimates ofstock size or to solve operational problems. In selected situations, a Council may determine that overfishing of a minorcomponent species of a multi-species fishery is warranted, based on netbenefits expected not only for the fishery but for the Nation. Althoughfishing any stock to the extent that it requires protection under the EndangeredSpecies Act (ESA) must never be allowed to occur, some very limited overfishingmay be acceptable if it is identified, and sufficiently analyzed and justified.However, in all cases, alternatives should be considered that would preventsuch overfishing. (See comment andplusmin;l9 and Appendix A to Subpart Bfor a fuller discussion of protection of non-targeted stock in a mixedspecies fishery.) Section 602.12(e) describes a SAFE document or set of documents preparedor aggregated periodically, whereby Councils can obtain an objective overviewof the best available information on the status of stocks and fisheriesunder management. Several Councils currently produce such fishery reviews,which generally provide the kinds of information suggested in the SAFEreport. The SAFE report does not necessarily call for new information ornew procedures; the intent is to provide, in one reference, an aggregationor a summary of the best biological, social, economic, and ecological informationavailable to a Council when needed: (a) To determine annual harvest levelsor OYs for species in each fishery management unit (FMU), and (b) to evaluatethe effectiveness of its management in preventing overfishing as definedby the Council. Such a report can provide a useful tracking tool for assessingthe relative achievement of FMP objectives by establishing a time-seriesdata base indicating the relative health of stocks and the industry dependenton them. While the Secretary has the responsibility for assuring that the SAFE reportis produced, it is not intended to be exclusively authored by NOAA. Thereport can be produced by any combination of talent from academic, government,or other sources. The report should be reviewed annually, but is not requiredto be revised annually except as there have been new developments or significantchanges in a fishery (see andSection;andSection; 602.12 (b) and (d), and andSection;602.13(d)(2)). Appendix A to Subpart B gives examples of the types of information/datathat are useful to the Council for its decisions. No one piece of informationis mandatory, but the report should contain the best available informationappropriate to the fishery, taking into consideration the need to establishpriorities within budget constraints.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Response. </ITAG>Section 602.11 Standard 1 1. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter felt that national standard 1 should notseek to obtain optimum yield for the ``United States fishing industry''(andSection; 602.11(a)), but rather, seek to provide the greatest overallbenefit to the Nation. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. The language of national standard1 is statutory (section 301(a)(1) of the Act). The Act was amended by Pub.L. 98-623 to highlight contemporaneous policy that the greatest benefitto the Nation would accrue from U.S., rather than foreign, fisheries. 2. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters expressed concern about the generaleffect of a stated conservation standard on OY. One felt that protectionagainst overfishing might be so constrained that appropriate harvest, underMSY and OY, would not be permitted. Another worried that defining overfishingonly in terms of MSY was too narrow and did not include the concept ofjeopardizing the ability of a stock to continue to yield food productionand recreational opportunities (values identified in the Act as a partof the definition of OY). A third wanted to add language to the criteriafor Secretarial approval of a Council definition to assure an optimum harvestto fulfill the [OY] ``standard of food production.'' <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. These comments emphasize protectionof the harvest rather than the resource, addressing allocation questionsrather than overfishing. In providing a general definition of overfishing,NOAA did not change the statutory relationship of overfishing to OY. (NOAA'sconcept of the relationship of overfishing to OY is more fully describedin the section of the preamble headed ``Overview of approach,'' in theAppendix to Subpart B, and in andSection; 602.11(g) of the guidelines.) Under the revised guidelines, Councils will be developing a definitionfor overfishing specific to the stocks or stock complexes in each of theFMPs. The development of such a definition is a public process, and onceproposed, the definition and its basis are subject to review and approvalby the Secretary under the criteria described in andSection; 602.11(c)(5).These criteria address resource rather than allocation issues. (See ``Overviewof policy'' section.) 3. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that overfishing be defined asany level of fishing that jeopardizes a stock's ability to remain at levelsthat yield OY; another proposed that ability to sustain OY be the measureof overfishing. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. Councils are free to define overfishingfor each stock or stock complex under management as is justified by thebest available scientific information. (See response to comments andplusmin;2and andplusmin;4.) 4. <T3>Comment:</T3> Another facet of the relationship of overfishing to OYwas illustrated by a comment urging that overfishing be defined as thelevel or rate of fishing mortality that reduces the target stock, or apopulation dependent upon it, below the OY level or to a level from whicheither is unable to recover to its pre-exploitation size in a specifiedtime. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. The guidelines do not preclude theCouncils from defining overfishing as exceeding OY or from specifying atimeframe for rebuilding of a stock; the guidelines are not intended todirect how a Council defines overfishing. NOAA believes that no universaldefinition or approach can be applied to every fishery. The guidelinesdo provide that individual FMP overfishing definitions for fishery managementunits, developed by the Council and approved by the Secretary, must bein place within 18 months from the effective date of the guidelines andthereafter. (See response to comments andplusmin;2 and andplusmin;3.) NOAA believes that the commenter's suggestion to extend the overfishingdefinition to include a population dependent upon the target stock goesbeyond the intent of the Act. Consideration of predator-prey relationshipsis already a necessary part of the determination of OY (see andSection; 602.11(f)(3)).In addition, provisions of the ESA and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)are among the other applicable law that must be considered by the Councilsin developing FMPs. While the provisions of the MMPA place no specificobligations on the Councils, a Council is expected to provide adequateinformation in FMPs and related National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)documents to inform the Secretary of any potential problems in the interactionof the fishery under management with marine mammal populations (see <T3>Operational Guidelines</T3>, Feb. 1988 revision). The Secretary hasthe responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the MMPA are carriedout. 5. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the use of the term MSY inthe general definition of overfishing in andSection; 602.11(c)(1), preferringthe terms ``maximum biological yield'' and ``maximum economic value'' asused in the original text of the 1983 guidelines. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. NOAA was persuaded during the Council/NOAAworkshops that the term ``MSY'' more accurately reflects the emphasis ofthe current revision on the relative abundance of living resource populationsin response to fishing. NOAA recognizes past controversy concerning MSYas a management goal. However, it is used in the Act as the baseline toolin the determination of OY and, as such, is the underlying biological rationaleupon which most determinations of OY rest. 6. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the phrase ``long-term''should be deleted from the first sentence of  andSection; 602.11(c)(1). Thecommenter argued that the term is undefined and that, given the presenceof the qualifying phrase ``on a continuing basis,'' it is redundant aswell. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. A catch equal to MSY may often beharvested for a short time, even from a severely depleted stock. Thus,this paragraph's use of the phrase ``on a continuing basis'' is significant.It is important to note that the phrase ``long-term'' is not used to qualifythe production of MSY on a continuing basis (which would be redundant),but rather to qualify a stock's capacity to produce MSY on a continuingbasis. NOAA believes that it is possible for a stock to lack the short-termcapacity to produce MSY on a continuing basis without being overfishedin the sense of the Act. For example, a temporarily depleted stock couldbecome decimated if managers attempted to institute an immediate and sustainedprogram of harvesting at the MSY level. The same stock, however, mightretain the long-term capacity to sustain such a harvest program, <T3>i.e.</T3>, given an appropriate fishing mortality rate, the stock couldrebuild to a level at which it could produce MSY on a continuing basis.As distinguished from temporary depletion, then, overfishing refers tothose cases in which a stock's long-term capacity to produce MSY on a continuingbasis is jeopardized.7. <T3>Comment: </T3>Instead of allowing specific overfishing definitionsto be developed in terms of a threshold biomass, maximum fishing mortalitylevel, or other measurable standard, one commenter suggested that the guidelinesshould require specification of a threshold biomass for each fishery. Thecommenter argued that, without a threshold biomass, stocks will inevitablybe overfished. <T3>Response: </T3>No change was made. The language of proposed andSection;602.11(c)(4), now andSection; 602.11(c)(5), makes clear that any specificoverfishing definition developed under this section must be sufficientto prevent the stock from being overfished. Given this, NOAA does not believeit necessary to mandate a particular form for all specific overfishingdefinitions. In particular, for stocks whose biomass cannot be estimatedreliably, it is difficult either to define a threshold biomass or to determinewhen such a threshold has been violated. In addition, andSection; 602.11(c)(6)describes how an FMP must or may prescribe measures to prevent overfishingunder the circumstances relevant to the form of the definition and theobjectives of the FMP. 8. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter noted that it is sometimes difficult todefine a threshold biomass, especially in the case of transboundary stocksor stocks exploited in a multispecies fishery. <T3>Response: </T3>No change was made. The commenter is correct, and haspinpointed the reason that the guidelines allow for other forms of specificoverfishing definitions. The general problems associated with managementof transboundary stocks are also addressed in the guidelines for nationalstandard 3 (andSection; 602.13). 9. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the requirement for specifyingan acceptable rebuilding time for overfished stocks is unrealistic whenrecruitment is uncertain. <T3>Response: </T3>No change was made. NOAA recognizes that uncertaintyinvolving any parameter will tend to make estimates of rebuilding timecorrespondingly uncertain. However, this fact does not remove the requirementto proceed with rebuilding at a reasonable rate. If a stock becomes overfished,national standard 1 implies that some sort of rebuilding program will benecessary. If left unconstrained, the rate of rebuilding theoreticallycould range between zero and the rate corresponding to complete cessationof fishing. However, a rate near zero would obviously be incompatible withthe intent of the Act. A Council and the Secretary should be able to agreeon some higher rebuilding rate that is consistent with national standard1 as well as with the objectives of the FMP in question. 10. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the use of ``should'' in proposedandSection; 602.11(c)(2), with reference to Council actions when a stockor stock complex is approaching an overfished condition. The commenterfelt it not in the spirit of standard 1 to leave addressing this issueto Council discretion. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA agrees in principle, and has moved this paragraphto a new section addressing actions of the Council to prevent overfishing(andSection; 602.11(c)(6)). No change was made in the wording, however, becausecircumstances surrounding such an event are time-dependent and may callfor a range of management measures difficult to include prospectively inan FMP beyond the intention to reduce fishing mortality. One of the purposesof the SAFE document(s) is to provide a tracking tool for the status ofthe stocks. In addition, under certain conditions, the use of frameworkmanagement measures, which provide the public with advance notice of potentialresponses to specific conditions, assist in quick action when necessary.(See guidelines for national standard 6, andSection; 602.16, and Phase Vof the <T3>Operational Guidelines, </T3>1983.) 11. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested deleting the word ``targeted''from proposed andSection; 602.11(c)(2), suggesting that, as written, theparagraph would allow a Council to avoid managing bycatch and discard levelsthat could be significant contributors to overfishing. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA did not intend to allow this, and has deleted ``targeted'',as requested. (See ``Overview of policy'' section, Appendix A to SubpartB, and responses to comments andplusmin;14 and andplusmin;19 for a furtherdiscussion of bycatch and sources of fishing mortality.) 12. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the guidance to the Councilbe changed to provide detailed population dynamics descriptions of thefactors involved in the various rates, such as natural mortality, etc.<T3>Response: </T3>No change was made. This guidance would not be required,as such material would be available in the SAFE documentation. 13. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended including a mandate to takeaction to control habitat degradation. <T3>Response: </T3>Habitat needs are recognized as critical to recruitment,but they are more appropriately addressed in other areas of the Council'sresponsibility and are not directly related to the definition of overfishing.However, proposed andSection; 602.11(c)(5), which is now found at andSection;602.11(c)(7), addresses alterations in environment/habitat conditions.It was modified to reference the new discretionary responsibilities ofthe Councils under section 302(i) of the Act concerning the effect of activitiesundertaken by any State or Federal agency that may affect fisheries underCouncil authority. 14. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was suggested that the words ``targeted effort'' inproposed andSection; 602.11(c)(2)(iii) be changed to ``harvest.''<T3>Response:</T3> The word ``targeted'' has been deleted because measuresto address overfishing need to consider all sources of fishing mortality.The word ``effort'' was retained as it more directly relates to fishingmortality. Harvest usually refers only to fish landed and does not includediscard mortality. (See ``Overview of policy'' section.) 15. <T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter suggested that ``should'' be changed to ``must''in the second sentence of proposed andSection; 602.11(c)(3) so that it wouldread, ``Councils must build into the definition appropriate considerationof risk.'' <T3>Response:</T3> NOAA accepts this suggestion as being consistent withthe requirements of national standard 6, and with the intent of this revisionto emphasize conservation. 16. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that language be added to proposedandSection; 602.11(c)(3) to require that the record be clear (a) on the factorsconsidered in arriving at a Council's judgment in cases where scientificdata are severely limited, and (b) on any efforts made to include timespecific milestones to identify and gather the needed data on which informeddecisions could be made. <T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees that Council decisions should be publiclydocumented. However, no change in language was made here. The guidelinesfor national standard 7 (andSection; 602.17) and the requirements of NEPAand E.O. 12291 provide the relevant direction on the questions of analysisand public record. (See the response to comment andplusmin;37 on the generalquestion of timeliness of data.) 17. <T3>Comment:</T3> The same commenter wished to add similar language toproposed andSection; 602.11(c)(4) to ensure that the decision elements ofSecretarial approval or disapproval be made a part of the record of theFMP. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. The Secretary's consideration ofthe elements in andSection; 602.11(c)(4), which is now found at andSection;602.11(c)(5), will be part of the administrative record for the FMP oramendment. 18. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter was concerned that the criteria for Secretarialapproval include consideration of Indian Treaty rights as stated in theAct. <T3>Response:</T3> This comment brought to NOAA's attention the ambiguityof this section as proposed. The first sentence has been redrafted to read,``Secretarial approval or disapproval <T3>of the definition of overfishing</T3> will be based on * * *''. Considerationof Indian Treaty rights as a factor in developing FMPs is unaffected bythese revisions to andSection; 602.11; supplementary guidance is availablein the <T3>Operations Guidelines</T3>, Feb. 1988 revision. (See ``Overview ofpolicy'' section.) 19. <T3>Comment:</T3> Four commenters noted an apparent inconsistency betweenthe mandate to prevent overfishing and the exception in proposed andSection;602.11(c)(6) that would allow overfishing of certain stocks. One suggestedthat this is ``bycatch'' overfishing and should be identified as such.Another contended that the risk of overfishing the bycatch species shoulddetermine the allowable fishing effort on the primary species. The fourthcommenter suggested that any bycatch that reduces food supplies and therebyindirectly causes marine mammals, birds, or other species to be reducedbelow their optimum sustainable level also should constitute overfishingunder the Act. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. This paragraph does not allow overfishingof any species for commercial reasons in violation of national standard1, and does not indicate lack of concern for individual populations withina fishery management unit (FMU). Rather, the intent of this paragraph isto allow mixed species fishing under certain conditions. First, the deliberateoverfishing of a ``minor stock component'' must be identified. Second,the excepted type of overfishing must be demonstrated by analysis to resultin net benefits not only to the fishery but to the Nation. This analysisshould indicate who would benefit, who would suffer losses and to whatextent (in quantitative terms, if possible), and why such overfishing iswarranted. Finally, it must be demonstrated that the excepted overfishingwould not cause any stock component, regardless of FMU, to require protectionunder the ESA. (See ``Overview of policy'' section and Appendix A to SubpartB.) NOAA does not agree that the excepted type of overfishing should be labeledbycatch overfishing because it confuses different forms of bycatch mortality.For example, the term bycatch may apply to species caught out of season,catches of an undesired sex of a species or at a time when product recoveryrates are low, or prohibited species catches. Causing the depletion of any species of marine mammals is not authorizedby this section. (See response to comment andplusmin;4 for discussion ofpredator/prey relationships, of the general relationship between the MMPAand the Magnuson Act and of the Councils' need to be cognizant of the interactionof fishery management with marine mammal populations.) 20. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter complained that proposed  andSection; 602.11(c)(7)apparently proscribed designation of ``growth'' or ``pulse'' overfishingas overfishing under national standard 1. Another wished to delete referenceto ``pulse'' fishing entirely, and two commenters suggested that ``growth'',``localized'', or ``pulse'' overfishing should be recognized as overfishingunder national standard l if they tend to preclude achievement of OY. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. This paragraph (now designated asandSection; 602.11(c)(3)) states simply that these fishing patterns do notnecessarily constitute overfishing under national standard 1, which theguidelines define generally as a rate of fishing that jeopardizes the long-termcapacity of a stock or stock complex to produce MSY on a continuing basis.To the extent that it satisfies this general definition in particular cases,either ``growth'' or ``pulse'' overfishing may constitute overfishing undernational standard 1. For example, ``growth'' overfishing could qualifyas overfishing under national standard 1 if it resulted in the removalof too many fish before they are old enough to spawn. In the case of either``growth'' or ``pulse'' overfishing, the key point is not so much the patternof fishing (<T3>e.g.</T3>, pulse vs. sustained) as the rate of fishing mortality andits effect on the long-term capacity of the stock to produce MSY. A Councilmay recommend conservation and management measures to prevent or permitthese effects, depending on the objectives of a particular FMP and thespecific definition of overfishing established for the stock or stock complexunder management. (See andSection; 602.11(c)(6)(v) and Appendix A to SubpartB.) Although the guidelines acknowledge that the specified fishing patternsmay constitute overfishing under national standard 1 in particular cases,it should be noted that this would occur only when such patterns jeopardizedthe long-term capacity of a stock or stock complex to produce MSY on acontinuing basis, not simply because they tended to preclude achievementof OY. Although it is theoretically possible for the prevention of overfishingto coincide with the achievement of OY, national standard 1 distinguishesbetween the two. That distinction is maintained in the guidelines.21. <T3>Comment:</T3> In the proposed rule, NOAA specifically solicited commenton the implementation provisions. One commenter wanted to ensure a timecertain for submissions of amendments to existing FMPs; another wantedto make sure that all FMPs were included in the requirement for an overfishingdefinition, existing and future. In addition, at the Council Chairmen'smeeting on January 27-28, 1989, the Chairmen made some recommendationsregarding the phase-in schedule: (a) That the 18-month implementation datebe retained; (b) that any FMP or amendment in progress at the time of theeffective date of the revised rule must include a definition of overfishing;(c) that within 3 months of the effective date, each Council advise theSecretary of its intent to comply, and if, in its opinion, any FMP is currentlyconsistent with the provisions of  andSection; 602.11(c) without amendment;(d) that within 12 months of the effective date, the Secretary review suchFMP and notify the Council of concurrence or disagreement; and (e) thatwithin 15 months of the effective date, each Council submit an amendmentto any FMP not currently consistent with the provisions of  andSection; 602.11(c)to bring it into compliance. <T3>Response:</T3> Section 602.11(c)(8) is revised to accommodate all thecommenters' recommendations, except that the time for Secretarial reviewand notification to a Council regarding concurrence or disagreement withits opinion as to consistency is reduced from 12 months from the effectivedate to 3 months from receipt of a Council's letter of advice. This allowsCouncils more time to develop amendments as necessary before the 18-monthimplementation date. 22. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters suggested that paragraph 602.11(e) shouldinclude an explicit statement of the relationship between ABC and overfishing.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. The paragraph states that ABC mustbe ``acceptable''; therefore, ABC can never imply a harvest level thatwould constitute overfishing. In particular, when overfishing is definedin terms of a threshold, the paragraph makes clear that ABC must equalzero whenever the threshold is violated. 23. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters suggested that specification of ABC shouldbe mandatory for each stock covered by an FMP. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. Since ABC is not mentioned in theAct, its specification is viewed only as one possible step in the processof preventing overfishing while achieving OY. NOAA's aim in drafting thissection was to reflect how ABC is defined and used by those Councils thatcurrently employ the concept. 24. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters suggested that paragraph 602.11(e) incorporatelanguage requiring the use of conservative estimates, by choosing eitherthe scientific parameter estimates that yield the lowest reasonable valueof ABC, or the lowest reasonable estimates of the parameters listed inthe second sentence of andSection; 602.11(e)(2). <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. Since the Councils that currentlyemploy the ABC concept do not require the use of conservative estimates,such language is not included in this section (see response to commentandplusmin;23). Since ABC is used as a step in determining OY and consequentmanagement measures, its specification is susceptible to the requirementsof national standard 6 to consider uncertainty in parameter estimates.25. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter wanted to change the definition of OY toinclude benefits other than food production and recreational opportunities.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. The definition of OY at  andSection;602.11(f)(1) is the statutory definition and includes other modifiers_economic,social, or ecological factors. (Also see andSection; 602.11(f)(3).) 26. <T3>Comment:</T3> A Council suggested deletion of the phrase ``at reasonableprices'' from the goal of providing seafood to consumers in andSection; 602.11(f)(2)(i).The commenter considered the goal unrealistic since forces such as internationalmarkets, which are beyond a Council's purview, control consumer prices.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees, and has deleted the phrase. 27. <T3>Comment:</T3> In andSection; 602.11(f)(3), a commenter suggested removingthe example of a factor that might not be relevant in every fishery. <T3>Response:</T3> NOAA has deleted the phrase ``for instance, there maybe no Indian treaty rights''. 28. <T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter wanted to emphasize the value of both commercialand recreational fisheries as economic factors in andSection; 602.11(f)(3)(i).<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA accommodated this comment by deleting the adjective``industrial'' so that the value of all types of fisheries is listed. 29. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters had suggestions for additional socialfactors to be listed in andSection; 602.11(f)(3)(ii). <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. This paragraph contains examples;the list is not meant to be exclusive. 30. <T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter requested an addition to  andSection; 602.11(f)(4)to address the possibility of a closure before the end of a fishing season.The comment proposed inclusion of an OY reserve and suballocations of quotasas part of the OY specification. Such measures would preclude fishermenin one geographic location from harvesting the entire quota and denyingfishing opportunities to fishermen in a different geographic location.Two commenters sought inclusion of the allocative reserve concept in andSection;602.11(g)(3) to serve the same purpose. <T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. NOAA agrees that OY reserves andgeographic suballocations are useful management measures. The problemsthey address fall under the allocation concerns of national standard 4and are covered by the guidelines at andSection; 602.14. 31. <T3>Comment:</T3> The word ``multiyear'' in andSection; 602.11(f)(4)(iv)was considered superfluous by one commenter, who noted that all FMPs arenow multiyear. <T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees, and has deleted the word ``multiyear.''32. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters objected to the allusion to a ``fabricatedMSY'' in andSection; 602.11(f)(4)(v). <T3>Response:</T3> NOAA deleted the phrase as misleading. The Act doesrequire that OY be derived from MSY; however, NOAA recognizes that thereare cases where the specification of MSY may be either impossible or irrelevant.This may be due to lack of assessment data (as in minor components of amixed-species fishery), or because biological resiliency or high fecundityof some stocks or other fishery characteristic may allow OY to become adescriptive statement only, making a numerical calculation of MSY unnecessary.Nevertheless, NOAA wants to emphasize that OY must still be derived frombiological information, as for example, the proportional abundance of associatedspecies.33. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether the analysis required byandSection; 602.11(f)(5) is part of the FMP at the time it is first submittedfor public review.<T3>Response:</T3> The answer is yes. 34. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter questioned who would judge the requirementin andSection; 602.11(g)(1) that management measures be enforceable; theCouncil does not want ``existing and arguably outmoded enforcement capabilities''to control the Council's choice of management measures. <T3>Response: </T3>The Department of Commerce and the Coast Guard are chargedwith enforcement of fishery regulations. Their judgments about the practicalityand effectiveness of proposed management measures in terms of enforceabilityshould be given serious consideration by the Councils. Guidance may befound in Part V of the <T3>MFCMA Handbook. </T3>Section 602.12 Standard 2 35. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter noted that annual SAFE reports for some fisheriesmay not be necessary as the rate of change in the resource may be slow. <T3>Response: </T3>No change was made. Accumulation of new informationon any resource may be slow and not indicate a need for an annual SAFEreport. This is why NOAA proposed at andSection; 602.12(e)(1)(i) that theSAFE report be reviewed at least annually to determine if updating or changingit in any way is warranted. 36. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter complained that the guidelines were unclearon who determines the membership of the ``SAFE panel,'' while another sawno need to require Council and NMFS representatives on any team chargedwith drafting a SAFE report. <T3>Response: </T3>The periodic production of SAFE reports as proposedcontemplated no SAFE panel or committee <T3>per se. </T3>Councils and their associated NMFS Regional Offices maydetermine how best to acquire and analyze data and write the report. Anycombination of talent from Council, State, university, Federal or othersources may be used for this purpose. NOAA agrees, therefore, that sincethere is no need to require representatives of any specific group on aSAFE report drafting team, the parenthetical phrase ``(but at a minimummust include Council and NMFS representatives)'' is unnecessary and hasdeleted it. 37. <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters suggested that SAFE reports should beprepared at least 6 months prior to the beginning of a fishing year toallow time for the rulemaking process to use the report as a technicalbasis for regulations that must be in place at the beginning of the fishingyear. <T3>Response: </T3>No change was made. Timeliness is part of the informationobjective of the SAFE report. Ideally, the most recent edition of a SAFEreport, with the most current data, should be available to a Council intime for their determination of harvest levels or OYs for any fishing year.However, publication of a SAFE report 6 months in advance of this timemay obviate use of the best available information. For example, if 5 or6 months are necessary to do fish stock and industry surveys and analysesof the resulting data, requiring the summary of these data 6 months priorto a Council's determination of harvest levels will assure that this determinationwill be based on data that are about a year old when they are used andprevent the use of any more recent analyses, if available. This would placethe Council in a position of managing next year's fishery with last year'sdata when some data from the current year also may be available. For thisreason, the guidelines do not impose specific timeliness criteria on theproduction of SAFE reports. Deadlines for the completion of these reportsare better set by the Councils in consultation with NMFS and other scientistswho are most familiar with the production and analysis of fishery datafor making management decisions. 38. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern with the contentsof the SAFE report. Some comments expressed a need for more specific attentionfor marine recreational fisheries and non-consumptive users of fisheryresources in the suggested list of types of information for inclusion inSAFE reports. For example, some reviewers thought that the term ``recreationalfishing industries'' excluded such non-consumptive activities as photography,diving, research, having a recreational fishing experience, and other aestheticuses. Other comments focused on a need to include more economic descriptorssuch as demand curves for recreational fishing and each commercial fishingproduct, estimates of producer and consumer surplus for recreational andcommercial fisheries, and economic or catch rate threshold levels at whichfishermen will choose to enter or leave a fishery. Some comments suggestedinclusion of more biological information. One comment criticized the suggestedSAFE report contents as failing to link the report to the specificationof overfishing required under andSection; 602.11(c). The commenter wrotethat the report should focus on a determination of fishing mortality rateand stock conditions relative to the specific criteria for overfishing.Another commenter stated that the report must include assessments of howfisheries affect and are affected by marine mammals, birds, and other non-targetspecies. <T3>Response: </T3>The kinds of data or information that NOAA contemplatedin proposing the SAFE report are those that are necessary for understandingthe biological condition of the harvested fish stock and the socioeconomiccondition of the persons or businesses that rely on such harvests. NOAAlisted some types of data that may be useful for this purpose by way ofexample. Recognizing that such a listing within the body of the guidelinetext might be perceived as mandatory or exclusive, NOAA moved the languagedescribing examples of SAFE information to the Appendix. Thus, it shouldbe clear that the lists (a) are not mandatory; (b) are not intended tobe exclusive of other kinds of data that may have particular pertinencein certain areas; additional types of information_such as those recommendedfor inclusion in SAFE reports by the commenters_may be included if neededand available. NOAA agrees that emphasis appears to be placed on commercial and extractiveuses of marine fisheries. Therefore, in andSection; 602.12(e)(1), the phrase``the recreational and commercial fishing industries'' has been changedto read ``recreational and commercial interests,'' and the appropriateAppendix language describing examples of SAFE information was modifiedaccordingly. NOAA also agrees that to insert ``commercially'' before ``harvested''(in what is now found in Appendix A to Subpart B under paragraph (2)(b)of the SAFE Report section) clarifies an ambiguity.Essentially, any kind of information needed by a Council and the Secretaryfor periodic understanding of the state of the fishery would be appropriatefor inclusion in a SAFE report. NOAA cautions, however, that while SAFEreports should present comprehensive and synoptic information on a fishery,they need not be encyclopedic. SAFE reports should present objective, scientificallybased information relevant to the fishery. To satisfy the purposes of the SAFE report, NOAA intends to allow maximumflexibility to Councils, in cooperation with the appropriate NMFS Regionsand Centers, to develop the contents and organization of SAFE reports inthe most reasonable or logical way for the fisheries being described. Thismay or may not include a discussion on how close a fishery is to a conditionof being overfished. 39. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter was concerned about the identificationof data deficiencies and suggested that SAFE reports recommend ways toresolve such deficiencies and a priority for securing identified data needs.<T3>Response: </T3>No change was made. A discussion of data needs may beincluded if deemed necessary for making management decisions. Such discussionsmay be more relevant in a separate document, however, as the SAFE reportis intended to display a synopsis of known or existing information overtime. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere has determinedthat this rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysisunder E.O. 12291. The guidelines indicate how NOAA interprets the fisherymanagement principles in the national standards of the Magnuson Act. Theydescribe a range of acceptable management measures that could be adoptedby the Councils, approved by the Secretary, and subsequently translatedinto regulations. The impact upon the public occurs through specific managementmeasures contained within specific FMPs; until a specific FMP is developed,there is no basis for evaluating the consequences of these guidelines.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theSmall Business Administration that this rule, if adopted, will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) was not prepared.Any economic impacts on small entities will be addressed through RFAs forindividual FMPs. These amendments to the national standard guidelines do not themselvesaffect the human environment. Thus, NOAA has determined that no environmentalimpact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA) is required. FMPsand FMP amendments developed as a result of these guidelines will requireEISs or EAs. This rule contains no collection-of-information requirements subject tothe Paperwork Reduction Act. Because the guidelines will have no direct regulatory impact upon the public,NOAA has determined that this rule does not directly affect the coastalzone of any State with an approved coastal zone management program. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 602</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.

(1) This subpart establishes guidelines, based on thenational standards, to assist in the development and review of FMPs, amendments,and regulations prepared by the Councils and the Secretary.(2) In developing FMPs, the Councils have the initial authority to ascertainfactual circumstances, to establish management objectives, and to proposemanagement measures that will achieve the objectives. The Secretary willdetermine whether the proposed management objectives and measures are consistentwith the national standards, other provisions of the Act, and other applicablelaw. The Secretary has an obligation under section 301(b) of the Act toinform the Councils of the Secretary's interpretation of the national standardsso that they will have an understanding of the basis on which FMPs willbe reviewed.(3) The national standards are statutory principles that must be followedin any FMP. The guidelines summarize Secretarial interpretations that havebeen and will be, applied under these principles. The guidelines are intendedas aids to decisionmaking; FMPs formulated according to the guidelineswill have a better chance for expeditious Secretarial review, approval,and implementation. FMPs that are in substantial compliance with the guidelines,the Act, and other applicable law must be approved.(b) <T3>Fishery management objectives.</T3> (1) Each FMP, whether preparedby a Council or by the Secretary, should identify what the FMP is designedto accomplish, i.e., the management objectives to be attained in regulatingthe fishery under consideration. In establishing objectives, Councils balancebiological constraints with human needs, reconcile present and future costsand benefits, and integrate the diversity of public and private interests.If objectives are in conflict, priorities should be established among them.(2) How objectives are defined is important to the management process.Objectives should address the problems of a particular fishery. The objectivesshould be clearly stated, practicably attainable, framed in terms of definableevents and measurable benefits, and based upon a comprehensive rather thana fragmentary approach to the problems addressed. An FMP should make aclear distinction between objectives and the management measures chosento achieve them. The objectives of each FMP provide the context withinwhich the Secretary will judge the consistency of an FMP's conservationand management measures with the national standards. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 602.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Standard 1_Optimum Yield. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard 1. </T3>Conservation and management measures shall preventoverfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield fromeach fishery for the United States fishing industry. (b) <T3>General. </T3>The determination of OY is a decisional mechanism forresolving the Act's multiple purposes and policies, for implementing anFMP's objectives, and for balancing the various interests that comprisethe national welfare. OY is based on MSY, or on MSY as it may be adjustedunder paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The most important limitation onthe specification of OY is that the choice of OY_and the conservation andmanagement measures proposed to achieve it_must prevent overfishing. (c) <T3>Overfishing. </T3>(1) Overfishing is a level or rate of fishing mortalitythat jeopardizes the long-term capacity of a stock or stock complex toproduce MSY on a continuing basis. Each FMP must specify, to the maximumextent possible, an objective and measurable definition of overfishingfor each stock or stock complex covered by that FMP, and provide an analysisof how the definition was determined and how it relates to reproductivepotential. (2) The definition of overfishing for a stock or stock complex may be developedor expressed in terms of a minimum level of spawning biomass (``threshold'');maximum level or rate of fishing mortality; or formula, model, or othermeasurable standard designed to ensure the maintenance of the stock's productivecapacity. Overfishing must be defined in a way to enable the Council andthe Secretary to monitor and evaluate the condition of the stock or stockcomplex relative to the definition. (3) Different fishing patterns can produce a variety of effects on localand areawide abundance, availability, size, and age composition of a stock.Some of these fishing patterns have been called ``growth,'' ``localized,''or ``pulse'' overfishing; however, these patterns are not necessarily overfishingunder the national standard 1 definition, which focuses on recruitmentand long-term reproductive capacity. (Also see paragraph (c)(6)(v) of thissection and Appendix A to Subpart B of this part.) (4) Overfishing definitions must be based on the best scientific informationavailable. Councils must build into the definition appropriate considerationof risk, taking into account uncertainties in estimating domestic harvest,stock conditions, or the effects of environmental factors (see andSection;602.16 of this part). In cases where scientific data are severely limited,the Councils' informed judgment must be used, and effort should be directedto identifying and gathering the needed data (see andSection;andSection; 602.12and 605.14 of this part). (5) Secretarial approval or disapproval of the overfishing definition willbe based on consideration of whether the proposal: (i) Has sufficient scientific merit; (ii) Is likely to result in effective Council action to prevent the stockfrom closely approaching or reaching an overfished status; (iii) Provides a basis for objective measurement of the status of the stockagainst the definition; and (iv) Is operationally feasible. (6) In addition to a specific definition of overfishing for each stockor stock complex, an FMP must contain management measures necessary toprevent overfishing. (i) If overfishing is defined in terms of a threshold biomass level, theCouncil must ensure that fishing effort does not cause spawning biomassto fall and remain below that threshold. (ii) If overfishing is defined in terms of a maximum fishing mortalityrate, the Council must ensure that fishing effort on that stock does notcause the maximum rate to be exceeded. (iii) If data indicate that an overfished condition exists, a program mustbe established for rebuilding the stock over a period of time specifiedby the Council and acceptable to the Secretary. (iv) If data indicate that a stock or stock complex is approaching an overfishedcondition, the Council should identify actions or combination of actionsto be undertaken in response. (v) Depending on the objectives of a particular FMP and the specific definitionof overfishing established for the stock or stock complex under management,a Council may recommend measures to prevent or permit pulse, localized,or growth overfishing. (See Appendix A to Subpart B of this part for explanatorymaterial.) (7) Significant adverse alterations in environment/habitat conditions increasethe possibility that fishing effort will contribute to a stock collapse.Care shouId be taken to identify the cause of any downward trends in spawningstock sizes or average annual recruitment. (See Appendix A to Subpart Bof this part for discussion of indicators of existing or impending overfishing.)(i) Whether these trends are caused by environmental changes or by fishingeffort, the only direct control provided by the Act is to reduce fishingmortality. (ii) Unless the Council asserts, as supported by appropriate evidence,that reduced fishing effort would not alleviate the problem, the FMP mustinclude measures to reduce fishing mortality regardless of the cause ofthe low population level. (iii) If man-made environmental changes are contributing to the downwardtrends, in addition to controlling effort Councils should recommend restorationof habitat and other ameliorative programs, to the extent possible, andconsider whether to take action under section 302(i) of the Act. (8) There are certain limited exceptions to the requirement of preventingoverfishing. Harvesting the major component of a mixed fishery at its optimumlevel may result in the overfishing of a minor (smaller or less valuable)stock component in the fishery. A Council may decide to permit this typeof overfishing if it is demonstrated by analysis (paragraph (f)(5) of thissection) that it will result in net benefits to the Nation, and if theCouncil's action will not cause any stock to require protection under theEndangered Species Act (ESA). (9) After February 25, 1991, all new and existing FMPs should contain adefinition of overfishing for the stock or stock complex managed underthe affected FMP. (i) An FMP or amendment being developed and not yet adopted as final bythe Councils at the time these guidelines become effective should containa definition of overfishing when submitted for approval by the Secretary.(ii) On or before September 22, 1989, Councils should examine each existingFMP as amended and notify the Regional Director if, in the opinion of theCouncil, the FMP is currently consistent with the provisions of andSection;602.11(c) without amendment. Within 90 days of notification, the Secretarywill review any such FMP for consistency with andSection; 602.11(c), andnotify the Council of concurrence or disagreement. (iii) On or before November 23, 1990, an amendment should be prepared andsubmitted to the Secretary for all existing FMPs not approved under paragraph(b)(9)(ii) of this section to add a definition of overfishing for the stockor stock complex managed under the affected FMP. (d) <T3>MSY. </T3>(1) MSY is the largest average annual catch or yield thatcan be taken over a significant period of time from each stock under prevailingecological and environmental conditions. (2) MSY may be presented as a range of values. One MSY may be specifiedfor a related group of species in a mixed-species fishery. Since MSY isa long-term average, it need not be specified annually, but must be basedon the best scientific information available. (3) MSY may be only the starting point in providing a realistic biologicaldescription of allowable fishery removals. MSY may need to be adjustedbecause of environmental factors, stock peculiarities, or other biologicalvariables, prior to the determination of OY. An example of such an adjustmentis determination of ABC.(e) <T3>ABC. </T3>(1) ABC is a preliminary description of the acceptable harvest(or range of harvests) for a given stock or stock complex. Its derivationfocuses on the status and dynamics of the stock, environmental conditions,other ecological factors, and prevailing technological characteristicsof the fishery. (2) When ABC is used, its specification constitutes the first step in derivingOY from MSY. Unless the best scientific information available indicatesotherwise (see andSection; 602.12 of this part), ABC should be no higherthan the product of the stock's natural mortality rate and the biomassof the exploitable stock. If a threshold has been specified for the stock,ABC must equal zero when the stock is at or below that threshold (see paragraph(c)(2) of this section). ABC may be expressed in numeric or nonnumericterms. (f) <T3>OY</T3>_(1) <T3>Definition. </T3>The term ``optimum'' with respect to the yield froma fishery, means the amount of fish which will provide the greatest overallbenefit to the Nation, with particular reference to food production andrecreational opportunities; and which is prescribed as such on the basisof the maximum sustainable yield from each fishery, as modified by anyrelevant economic, social, or ecological factors (section 3(18)(b) of theAct). (2) <T3>Values in determination. </T3>In determining the greatest benefit tothe Nation, two values that should be weighed are food production and recreationalopportunities (section 3(18)(a) of the Act). They should receive seriousattention as measures of benefit when considering the economic, ecological,or social factors used in modifying MSY to obtain OY. (i) ``Food production'' encompasses the goals of providing seafood to consumers,maintaining an economically viable fishery, and utilizing the capacityof U.S. fishery resources to meet nutritional needs. (ii) ``Recreational opportunities'' includes recognition of the importanceof the quality of the recreational fishing experience, and of the contributionof recreational fishing to the national, regional, and local economiesand food supplies. (3) <T3>Factors relevant to OY. </T3>The Act's definition of OY identifiesthree categories of factors to be used in modifying MSY to arrive at OY:economic, social, and ecological (section 3(18)(b) of the Act). Not everyfactor will be relevant in every fishery. For some fisheries, insufficientinformation may be available with respect to some factors to provide abasis for corresponding modifications to MSY. (i) <T3>Economic factors. </T3>Examples are promotion of domestic fishing,development of unutilized or underutilized fisheries, satisfaction of consumerand recreational needs, and encouragement of domestic and export marketsfor U.S.-harvested fish. Some other factors that may be considered arethe value of fisheries, the level of capitalization, operating costs ofvessels, alternate employment opportunities, and economies of coastal areas.(ii) <T3>Social factors. </T3>Examples are enjoyment gained from recreationalfishing, avoidance of gear conflicts and resulting disputes, preservationof a way of life for fishermen and their families, and dependence of localcommunities on a fishery. Among other factors that may be considered arethe cultural place of subsistence fishing, obligations under Indian treaties,and world-wide nutritional needs. (iii) <T3>Ecological factors. </T3>Examples are the vulnerability of incidentalor unregulated species in a mixed-species fishery, predator-prey or competitiveinteractions, and dependence of marine mammals and birds or endangeredspecies on a stock of fish. Equally important are environmental conditionsthat stress marine organisms, such as natural and man-made changes in wetlandsor nursery grounds, and effects of pollutants on habitat and stocks. (4) <T3>Specification. </T3>(i) The ``amount of fish'' that constitutes theOY need not be expressed in terms of numbers or weight of fish. The economic,social, or ecological modifications to MSY may be expressed by describingfish having common characteristics, the harvest of which provides the greatestoverall benefit to the Nation. For instance, OY may be expressed as a formulathat converts periodic stock assessments into quotas or guideline harvestlevels for recreational, commercial, and other fishing. OY may be definedin terms of an annual harvest of fish or shellfish having a minimum weight,length, or other measurement. OY may also be expressed as an amount offish taken only in certain areas, or in certain seasons, or with particulargear, or by a specified amount of fishing effort. In the case of a mixed-speciesfishery, the incidental-species OY may be a function of the directed catch,or absorbed into an OY for related species. (ii) If a numerical OY is chosen, a range or average may be specified.(iii) In a fishery where there is a significant discard component, theOY may either include or exclude discards, consistent with the other yielddeterminations. (iv) The OY specification can be converted into an annual numerical estimateto establish any TALFF and to analyze impacts of the management regime.There should be a mechanism in an FMP for periodic reassessment of theOY specification, so that it is responsive to changing circumstances inthe fishery. (See andSection; 602.12(e).) (v) The determination of OY requires a specification of MSY. However, evenwhere sufficient scientific data as to the biological characteristics ofthe stock do not exist, or the period of exploitation or investigationhas not been long enough for adequate understanding of stock dynamics,or where frequent large-scale fluctuations in stock size make this conceptof limited value, the OY should be based on the best scientific informationavailable. (5) <T3>Analysis. </T3>An FMP must contain an analysis of how its OY specificationwas determined (section 303(a)(3) of the Act). It should relate the explanationof overfishing in paragraph (c) of this section to conditions in the particularfishery, and explain how its choice of OY and conservation and managementmeasures will prevent overfishing in that fishery. If overfishing is permittedunder paragraph (c)(8) of this section, the analysis must contain a justificationin terms of overall benefits and an assessment of the risk of the speciesor stock component reaching a ``threatened'' or ``endangered'' status.A Council must identify those economic, social, and ecological factorsrelevant to management of a particular fishery, then evaluate them to arriveat the modification (if any) of MSY. The choice of a particular OY mustbe carefully defined and documented to show that the OY selected will producethe greatest benefit to the Nation. (g) <T3>OY as a target. </T3>(1) The specification of OY in an FMP is not automaticallya quota or ceiling, although quotas may be derived from the OY where appropriate.OY is a target or goal; an FMP must contain conservation and managementmeasures, and provisions for information collection, that are designedto achieve OY. These measures should allow for practical and effectiveimplementation and enforcement of the management regime, so that the harvestis allowed to reach but not to exceed OY by a substantial amount. The Secretaryhas an obligation to implement and enforce the FMP so that OY is achieved.If management measures prove unenforceable_or too restrictive or not rigorousenough to realize OY_they should be modified; an alternative is to reexaminethe adequacy of the OY specification. (2) Exceeding OY does not necessarily constitute overfishing, althoughthey might coincide. Even if no overfishing resulted, continual harvestat a level above a fixed-value OY would violate national standard l becauseOY was exceeded (not achieved) on a continuing basis. (3) Part of the OY may be held as a reserve to allow for uncertaintiesin estimates of stock size and of DAH or to solve operational problemsin achieving (but not exceeding) OY. If an OY reserve is established, anadequate mechanism should be included in the FMP to permit timely releaseof the reserve to domestic or foreign fishermen, if necessary. (h) <T3>OY and foreign fishing. </T3>Section 201(d) of the Act provides thatfishing by foreign nations is limited to that portion of the OY that willnot be harvested by vessels of the United States. (1) <T3>DAH. </T3>Councils must consider the capacity of, and the extent towhich, U.S. vessels will harvest the OY on an annual basis. Estimatingthe amount that U.S. fishing vessels will actually harvest is requiredto determine the surplus. (2) <T3>DAP. </T3>Each FMP must identify the capacity of U.S. processors. Itmust also identify the amount of DAP, which is the sum of two estimates:(i) The amount of U.S. harvest that domestic processors will process. Thisestimate may be based on historical performance and on surveys of the expressedintention of manufacturers to process, supported by evidence of contracts,plant expansion, or other relevant information; and (ii) The amount of fish that will be harvested by domestic vessels, butnot processed (<T3>e.g., </T3>marketed as fresh whole fish, used for private consumption,or used for bait). (3) <T3>JVP. </T3>When DAH exceeds DAP, the surplus is available for JVP. JVPis derived from DAH.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 602.12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Standard 2_Scientific Information. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard 2. </T3>Conservation and management measures shall be basedupon the best scientific information available.(b) <T3>FMP development.</T3> The fact that scientific information concerninga fishery is incomplete does not prevent the preparation and implementationof an FMP (see related andSection;andSection; 602.13(d)(2) and 602.17(b)).(1) Scientific information includes, but is not limited to, informationof a biological, ecological, economic, or social nature. Successful fisherymanagement depends, in part, on the timely availability, quality, and quantityof scientific information, as well as on the thorough analysis of thisinformation, and the extent to which the information is applied. If thereare conflicting facts or opinions relevant to a particular point, a Councilmay choose among them, but should justify the choice.(2) FMPs must take into account the best scientific information availableat the time of preparation. Between the initial drafting of an FMP andits submission for final review, new information often becomes available.This new information should be incorporated into the final FMP where practicable;but it is unnecessary to start the FMP process over again unless the informationindicates that drastic changes have occurred in the fishery that mightrequire revision of the management objectives or measures. (c) <T3>FMP implementation. </T3>(1) An FMP must specify whatever informationfishermen and processors will be required or requested to submit to theSecretary. Information about harvest within State boundaries, as well asin the EEZ, may be collected if it is needed for proper implementationof the FMP and cannot be obtained otherwise. The FMP should explain thepractical utility of the information specified in monitoring the fishery,in facilitating inseason management decisions, and in judging the performanceof the management regime; it should also consider the effort, cost, orsocial impact of obtaining it. (2) An FMP should identify scientific information needed from other sourcesto improve understanding and management of the resource and the fishery.(3) The information submitted by various data suppliers about the stocks(s)throughout its range or about the fishery should be comparable and compatible,to the maximum extent possible. (d) <T3>FMP amendment. </T3>FMPs should be amended on a timely basis, as newinformation indicates the necessity for change in objectives or managementmeasures. (e) <T3>Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report. </T3>(1) TheSAFE report is a document or set of documents that provides Councils witha summary of the most recent biological condition of species in the fisherymanagement unit (FMU), and the social and economic condition of the recreationaland commercial fishing interests and the fish processing industries. Itsummarizes, on a periodic basis, the best available scientific informationconcerning the past, present, and possible future condition of the stocksand fisheries being managed under Federal regulation.(i) The Secretary has the responsibility to assure that a SAFE report orsimilar document is prepared, reviewed annually, and changed as necessaryfor each FMP. The Secretary or Councils may utilize any combination oftalent from Council, State, Federal, university, or other sources to acquireand analyze data and produce the SAFE report.(ii) The SAFE report provides information to the Councils for determiningannual harvest levels from each stock, documenting significant trends orchanges in the resource and fishery over time, and assessing the relativesuccess of existing State and Federal fishery management programs. In addition,the SAFE report may be used to update or expand previous environmentaland regulatory impact documents, and ecosystem and habitat descriptions.(iii) Each SAFE report must be scientifically based, and cite data sourcesand interpretations.(2) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to base harvestspecifications (see Appendix A to Subpart B of this part for examples).(3) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to assess thesocial and economic condition of the persons and businesses that rely onthe use of fish resources, including fish processing industries (see AppendixA to Subpart B of this part for examples).(4) Each SAFE report may contain additional economic, social, and ecologicalinformation pertinent to the success of management or the achievement ofobjectives of each FMP (see Appendix A to Subpart B of this part for examples).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 602.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Standard 3_Management Units.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard 3</T3>. To the extent practicable, an individual stock offish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelatedstocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.(b) <T3>General.</T3> The purpose of this standard is to induce a comprehensiveapproach to fishery management. The geographic scope of the fishery, forplanning purposes, should cover the entire range of the stocks(s) of fish,and not be overly constrained by political boundaries. Wherever practicable,an FMP should seek to manage interrelated stocks of fish.(c) <T3>Unity of management.</T3> Cooperation and understanding among entitiesconcerned with the fishery (e.g., Councils, States, Federal government,international commissions, foreign nations) are vital to effective management.Where management of a fishery involves multiple jurisdictions, coordinationamong the several entities should be sought in the development of an FMP.Where a range overlaps Council areas, one FMP to cover the entire rangeis preferred. The Secretary designates which Council or Councils will preparethe FMP, under section 304(f) of the Act. (d) <T3>Management unit. </T3>The term ``management unit'' means a fisheryor that portion of a fishery identified in an FMP as relevant to the FMP'smanagement objectives.(1) <T3>Basis. </T3>The choice of a management unit depends on the focus ofthe FMP's objectives, and may be organized around biological, geographic,economic, technical, social, or ecological perspectives. For example:(i) <T3>Biological</T3>_could be based on a stock(s) throughout its range.(ii) <T3>Geographic</T3>_could be an area.(iii)<T3> Economic</T3>_could be based on a fishery supplying specific productforms.(iv) <T3>Technical</T3>_could be based on a fishery utilizing a specific geartype or similar fishing practices.(v) <T3>Social</T3>_could be based on fishermen as the unifying element, suchas when the fishermen pursue different species in a regular pattern throughoutthis year. (vi) <T3>Ecological</T3>_could be based on species that are associated in theecosystem or are dependent on a particular habitat.(2) <T3>Conservation and management measures.</T3> FMPs should include conservationand management measures for that part of the management unit within U.S.water, although the Secretary can ordinarily implement them only withinthe EEZ. The measures need not be identical for each geographic area withinthe management unit, if the FMP justifies the differences. A managementunit may contain, in addition to regulated species, stocks of fish forwhich there is not enough information available to specify MSY and OY orto establish management measures, so that data on these species may becollected under the FMP.(e) <T3>Analysis.</T3> To document that an FMP is as comprehensive as practicable,it should include discussions of the following:(1) The range and distribution of the stocks, as well as the patterns offishing effort and harvest. (2) Alternative management units and reasons for selecting a particularone. A less-than-comprehensive management unit may be justified if, forexample, complementary management exits or is planned for a separate geographicarea or for a distinct use of the stocks, or if the unmanaged portion ofthe resource is immaterial to proper management.(3) Management activities and habitat programs of adjacent States and theireffects on the FMP's objectives and management measures. Where State actionis necessary to implement measures within State waters to achieve FMP objectives,the FMP should identify what State action is necessary, discuss the consequencesof State inaction or contrary action, and make appropriate recommendations.The FMP should also discuss the impact that Federal regulations will haveon State management activities. (4) Management activities of other countries having an impact on the fishery,and how the FMP's management measures are designed to take into accountthese impacts. International boundaries may be dealt with in several ways.For example:(i) By limiting the management unit's scope to that portion of the stockfound in U.S. waters;(ii) By estimating MSY for the entire stock and then basing the determinationof OY for the U.S. fishery on the portion of the stock within U.S. waters;or(iii) By referring to treaties or cooperative agreements.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 602.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Standard 4_Allocations.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard 4.</T3> Conservation and management measures shall not discriminatebetween residents of different States. If it becomes necessary to allocateor assign fishing privileges among various United States fishermen, suchallocation shall be: (1) Fair and equitable to all such fishermen; (2)reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and (3) carried out in suchmanner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquiresan excessive share of such privileges.(b) <T3>Discrimination among residents of different States.</T3> An FMP maynot differentiate among U.S. citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or corporationson the basis of their State of residence. An FMP may not incorporate orrely on a State statute or regulation that discriminates against residentsof another State. Conservation and management measures that have differenteffects on persons in various geographic locations are permissible, ifthey satisfy the other guidelines under standard 4. Examples of these preceptsare:(1) An FMP that restricted fishing in the FCZ to those holding a permitfrom State X would violate standard 4 if State X issued permits only toits own citizens.(2) An FMP that closed a spawning ground might disadvantage fishermen livingin the State closest to it, because they would have to travel farther toan open area, but the closure could be justified under standard 4 as aconservation measure with no discriminatory intent.(c) <T3>Allocation of fishing privileges. </T3>An FMP may contain managementmeasures that allocate fishing privileges if such measures are necessaryor helpful in furthering legitimate objectives or in achieving the OY,and if the measures conform with paragraphs (c)(3) (i) through (iii) ofthis section.(1) <T3>Definition. </T3> An ``allocation'' or ``assignment'' of fishing privilegesis a direct and deliberate distribution of the opportunity to participatein a fishery among identifiable, discrete user groups or individuals. Anymanagement measure (or lack of management) has incidental allocative effects,but only those measures that result in direct distributions of fishingprivileges will be judged against the allocation requirements of standard4. Adoption of an FMP that merely perpetuates existing fishing practicesmay result in an allocation, if those practices directly distribute theopportunity to participate in the fishery. Allocations of fishing privilegesinclude, for example, per-vessel catch limits, quotas by vessel class andgear type, different quotas or fishing seasons for recreational and commercialfishermen, assignment of ocean areas to different gear users, and limitationof permits to a certain number of vessels or fishermen. (2) <T3>Analysis of allocations. </T3>Each FMP should contain a descriptionand analysis of the allocations existing in the fishery and of those madein the FMP. The effects of eliminating an existing allocation system shouldbe examined. Allocation schemes considered but rejected by the Councilshould be included in the discussion. The analysis should relate the recommendedallocations to the FMP's objectives and OY specification, and discuss thefactors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.(3) <T3>Factors in making allocations.</T3> An allocation of fishing privilegesmust be fair and equitable, must be reasonably calculated to promote conservation,and must avoid excessive shares. These tests are explained in paragraphs(c)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section:(i) <T3>Fairness and equity.</T3> (A) An allocation of fishing privileges shouldbe rationally connected with the achievement of OY or with the furtheranceof a legitimate FMP objective. Inherent in an allocation is the advantagingof one group to the detriment of another. The motive for making a particularallocation should be justified in terms of the objectives of the FMP; otherwise,the disadvantaged user groups or individuals would suffer without cause.For instance, an FMP objective to preserve the economic status quo cannotbe achieved by excluding a group of long-time participants in the fishery.On the other hand, there is a rational connection between an objectiveof harvesting shrimp at their maximum size and closing a nursery area totrawling.(B) An allocation of fishing privileges may impose a hardship on one groupif it is outweighed by the total benefits received by another group orgroups. An allocation need not preserve the status quo in the fishery toqualify as ``fair and equitable,'' if a restructuring of fishing privilegeswould maximize overall benefits. The Council should make an initial estimateof the relative benefits and hardships imposed by the allocation, and compareits consequences with those of alternative allocation schemes, includingthe status quo. Where relevant, judicial guidance and government policyconcerning the rights of treaty Indians and aboriginal Americans must beconsidered in determining whether an allocation is fair and equitable.(ii) <T3>Promotion of conservation.</T3> Numerous methods of allocating fishingprivileges are considered ``conservation and management measures'' undersection 303 of the Act. An allocation scheme may promote conservation byencouraging a rational, more easily managed use of the resource. Or itmay promote conservation (in the sense of wise use) by optimizing the yield,in terms of size, value, market mix, price, or economic or social benefitof the product. (iii) <T3>Avoidance of excessive shares. </T3>An allocation scheme must be designedto deter any person or other entity from acquiring an excessive share offishing privileges, and to avoid creating conditions fostering inordinatecontrol, by buyers or sellers, that would not otherwise exist.(iv) <T3>Other factors. </T3>In designing an allocation scheme, a Council shouldconsider other factors relevant to the FMP's objectives. Examples are economicand social consequences of the scheme, food production, consumer interest,dependence on the fishery by present participants and coastal communities,efficiency of various types of gear used in the fishery, transferabilityof effort to and impact on other fisheries, opportunity for new participantsto enter the fishery, and enhancement of opportunities for recreationalfishing. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 602.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Standard 5_Efficiency.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard 5. </T3>Conservation and management measures shall, wherepracticable, promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources;except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as its solepurpose. (b) <T3>Efficiency in the utilization of resources_</T3>(1) <T3>General. </T3>The term ``utilization'' encompasses harvesting, processing,and marketing, since man-agement decisions affect all three sectors ofthe industry. The goal of promoting efficient utilization of fishery resourcesmay conflict with other legitimate social or biological objectives of fisherymanagement. In encouraging efficient utilization of fishery resources,this standard highlights one way that a fishery can contribute to the Nation'sbenefit with the least cost to society: given a set of objectives for thefishery, an FMP should contain management measures that result in as efficienta fishery as is practicable or desirable. (2) <T3>Efficiency. </T3>In theory, an efficient fishery would harvest theOY with the minimum use of economic inputs such as labor, capital, interest,and fuel. Efficiency in terms of aggregate costs then becomes a conservationobjective, where ``conservation'' constitutes wise use of all resourcesinvolved in the fishery, not just fish stocks. (i) In an FMP, management measures may be proposed that allocate fish amongdifferent groups of individuals or establish a system of property rights.Alternative measures examined in searching for an efficient outcome willresult in different distributions of gains and burdens among identifiableuser groups. An FMP should demonstrate that management measures aimed atefficiency do not simply redistribute gains and burdens without an increasein efficiency. (ii) Management regimes that allow a fishery to operate at the lowest possiblecost (e.g. fishing effort, administration, and enforcement) for a particularlevel of catch and initial stock size are considered efficient. Restrictivemeasures that unnecessarily raise any of those costs move the regime towardinefficiency. Unless the use of inefficient techniques or the creationof redundant fishing capacity contributes to the attainment of other socialor biological objectives, an FMP may not contain management measures thatimpede the use of cost-effective techniques of harvesting, processing,or marketing, and should avoid creating strong incentives for excessiveinvestment in private sector fishing capital and labor. (c) <T3>Limited access. </T3>A ``system for limiting access,'' which is anoptional measure under section 303(b) of the Act, is a type of allocationof fishing privileges that may be used to promote economic efficiency orconservation. For example, limited access may be used to combat overfishing,overcrowding, or overcapitalization in a fishery to achieve OY. In an unutilizedor underutilized fishery, it may be used to reduce the chance that theseconditions will adversely affect the fishery in the future, or to provideadequate economic return to pioneers in a new fishery. In some cases, limitedentry is a useful ingredient of a conservation scheme, because it facilitatesapplication and enforcement of other management measures. (1) <T3>Definition. </T3>Limited access (or limited entry) is a managementtechnique that attempts to limit units of effort in a fishery, usuallyfor the purpose of reducing economic waste, improving net economic returnto the fishermen, or capturing economic rent for the benefit of the taxpayeror the consumer. Common forms of limited access are licensing of vessels,gear, or fishermen to reduce the number of units of effort, and dividingthe total allowable catch into fishermen's quotas (a stock-certificatesystem). Two forms (i.e., Federal fees for licenses or permits in excessof administrative costs, and taxation) are not permitted under the Act.(2) <T3>Factors to consider. </T3>The Act ties the use of limited access tothe achievement of optimum yield. An FMP that proposes a limited accesssystem must consider the factors listed in section 303(b)(6) of the Actand in andSection; 602.14(c)(3) of these guidelines. In addition, it shouldconsider the criteria for qualifying for a permit, the nature of the interestcreated, whether to make the permit transferable, and the Act's limitationon returning economic rent to the public under section 304(d)(1). The FMPshould also discuss the costs of achieving an appropriate distributionof fishing privileges. (d) <T3>Analysis. </T3>An FMP should discuss the extent to which overcapitalization,congestion, economic waste, and inefficient techniques in the fishery reducethe net benefits derived from the management unit and prevent the attainmentand appropriate allocation of OY. It should also explain in terms of theFMP's objectives any restriction placed on the use of efficient techniquesof harvesting, processing, or marketing. If during FMP development theCouncil considered imposing a limited-entry system, the FMP should analyzethe Council's decision to recommend or reject limited access as a techniqueto achieve efficient utilization of the resources of the fishing industry.(e) <T3>Economic allocation. </T3>This standard prohibits only those measuresthat distribute fishery resources among fishermen on the basis of economicfactors alone, and that have economic allocation as their only purpose.Where conservation and management measures are recommended that would changethe economic structure of the industry or the economic conditions underwhich the industry operates, the need for such measures must be justifiedin light of the biological, ecological, and social objectives of the FMPas well as the economic objectives. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 602.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Standard 6_Variations and Contingencies.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard 6. </T3>Conservation and management measures shall take intoaccount and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries,fishery resources, and catches.(b) <T3>Conservation and management. </T3>Each fishery exhibits unique uncertainties.The phrase ``conservation and management'' implies the wise use of fisheryresources through a management regime that includes some protection againstthese uncertainties. The particular regime chosen must be flexible enoughto allow timely response to resource, industry, and other national andregional needs. Continual data acquisition and analysis will help the developmentof management measures to compensate for variations and to reduce the needfor substantial buffers. Flexibility in the management regime and the regulatoryprocess will aid in responding to contingencies.(c) <T3>Variations. </T3>(1) In fishery management terms, variations arisefrom biological, social, and economic occurences, as well as from fishingpractices. Biological uncertainties and lack of knowledge can hamper attemptsto estimate stock size and strength, stock location in time and space,environmental/habitat changes, and ecological interactions. Economic uncertaintymay involve changes in foreign or domestic market conditions, changes inoperating costs, drifts toward overcapitalization, and economic perturbationscaused by changed fishing patterns. Changes in fishing practices, suchas the introduction of new gear, rapid increases or decreases in harvesteffort, new fishing strategies, and the effects of new management techniques,may also create uncertainties. Social changes could involve increases ordecreases in recreational fishing, or the movement of people into or outof fishing activities due to such factors as age or educational opportunities.(2) Every effort should be made to develop FMPs that discuss and take intoaccount these vicissitudes. To the extent practicable, FMPs should providea suitable buffer in favor of conservation. Allowances for uncertaintiesshould be factored into the various elements of an FMP. Examples are:(i) <T3>Reduce OY. </T3>Lack of scientific knowledge about the condition ofa stock(s) could be reason to reduce OY.(ii)<T3> Establish a reserve. </T3>Creation of a reserve may compensate foruncertainties in estimating domestic harvest, stock conditions, or environmentalfactors.(iii) <T3>Adjust management techniques. </T3>In the absence of adequate datato predict the effect of a new regime, and to avoid creating unwanted variations,a Council could guard against producing drastic changes in fishing patterns,allocations, or practices.(iv) <T3>Highlight habitat conditions. </T3>FMPs may address the impact of pollutionand the effects of wetland and estuarine degradation on the stocks of fish;identify causes of pollution and habitat degradation and the authoritieshaving jurisdiction to regulate or influence such activities; propose recommendationsthat the Secretary will convey to those authorities to alleviate such problems;and state the views of the Council on unresolved or anticipated issues.(d) <T3>Contingencies. </T3>Unpredictable events_such as unexpected resourcesurges or failures, fishing effort greater than anticipated, disruptivegear conflicts, climatic conditions, or environmental catastrophes_arebest handled by establishing a flexible management regime that containsa range of management options through which it is possible to act quicklywithout amending the FMP or even its regulations.(1) The FMP should describe the management options and their consequencesin the necessary detail to guide the Secretary in responding to changedcircumstances, so that the Council preserves its role as policy-setterfor the fishery. The description enable the public to understand what mayhappen under the flexible regime, and to comment on the options.(2) FMPs should include criteria for the selection of management measures,directions for their application, and mechanisms for timely adjustmentof management measures comprising the regime. For example, an FMP couldinclude criteria that allow the Secretary to open and close seasons, closefishing grounds, or make other adjustments in management measures.(3) Amendment of a flexible FMP would be necessary when circumstances inthe fishery change substantially, or when a Council adopts a differentmanagement philosophy and objectives.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 602.17</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Standard 7_Costs and Benefits.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard 7. </T3>Conservation and management measures shall, wherepracticable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.(b) <T3>Necessity of Federal management_(1) General. </T3>The principle thatnot every fishery needs regulation is implicit in this standard. The Actdoes not require Councils to prepare FMPs for each and every fishery_onlyfor those where regulation would serve some useful purpose and where thepresent or future benefits of regulation would justify the costs. For example,the need to collect data about a fishery is not, by itself, adequate justificationfor preparation of an FMP, since there are less costly ways to gather thedata (see andSection; 602.13(d)(2)). In some cases, the FMP preparation processitself, even if it does not culminate in a document approved by the Secretary,can be useful in supplying a basis for management by one or more coastalStates.(2) <T3>Criteria. </T3>In deciding whether a fishery needs management throughregulations implementing an FMP, the following general factors should beconsidered, among others:(i) The importance of the fishery to the Nation and to the regional economy.(ii) The condition of the stock or stocks of fish and whether an FMP canimprove or maintain that condition.(iii) The extent to which the fishery could be or is already adequatelymanaged by States, by State/Federal programs, by Federal regulations pursuantto FMPs or international commissions, or by industry self-regulation, consistentwith the policies and standards of the Act.(iv) The need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among user groupsand whether an FMP can further that resolution.(v) The economic condition of a fishery and whether an FMP can producemore efficeint utilization.(vi) The needs of a developing fishery, and whether an FMP can foster orderlygrowth.(vii) The costs associated with an FMP, balanced against the benefits (seeparagraph (d) of this section as a guide).(c) <T3>Alternative management measures. </T3>Management measures should notimpose unnecessary burdens on the economy, on individuals, on private orpublic organizations, or on Federal, State, local governments. Factorssuch as fuel costs, enforcement costs, or the burdens of collecting datamay well suggest a preferred alternative.(d) <T3>Analysis. </T3>The supporting analyses for FMPs should demonstratethat the benefits of fishery regulation are real and substantial relativeto the added research, administrative, and enforcement costs, as well ascosts to the industry of compliance. In determining the benefits and costsof management measures, each management strategy considered and its impactson different user groups in the fishery should be evaluated. This requirementneed not produce an elaborate, formalistic cost/benefit analysis. Rather,an evaluation of effects and costs, especially of differences among workablealternatives including the status quo, is adequate. If quantitative estimatesare not possible, qualitative estimates will suffice.(1) <T3>Burdens. </T3>Management measures should be designed to give fishermenthe greatest possible freedom of action in conducting business and pursuingrecreational opportunities that are consistent with ensuring wise use ofthe resources and reducing conflict in the fishery. The type and levelof burden placed on user groups by the regulations need to be identified.Such an examination should include, for example: capital outlays; operatingand maintenance costs; reporting costs; administrative, enforcement, andinformation costs; and prices to consumers. Management measures may shiftcosts from one level of government to another, from one part of the privatesector to another, or from the government to the private sector. Redistributionof costs through regulations is likely to generate controversy. A discussionof these and any other burdens placed on the public through FMP regulationsshould be a part of the FMP's supporting analyses.(2) <T3>Gains. </T3>The relative distribution of gains may change as a resultof instituting different sets of alternatives, as may the specific typeof gain. The analysis of benefits should focus on the specific gains producedby each alternative set of management measures, including the status quo.The benefits to society that result from the alternative management measuresshould be identified, and the level of gain assessed.<ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A to Subpart B_Explanatory Material </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Purpose of Appendix </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of the Appendix is to preserve, as codified reference,useful explanatory material and supplementary policy rationale originallypublished as preamble to the various editions of the proposed and final50 CFR Part 602 rules. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Overview of Approach </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines are designed to allow for innovative policy evolutionin response to new biological, social, economic, or ecological circumstances,and set out the benchmarks of current fishery management policy under theAct. NOAA believes the guidelines should supply the Councils, as fisherymanagement planners, a means to assess their work in developing and documentingtheir decisions. To that end, certain sections of the guidelines specificallyaddress requirements and options for contents of an FMP, supplementingand drawing into relevant focus provisions of Phase II, <T3>Operational Guidelines for the Fishery Management Process, </T3>February1988 revision. These sections are usually indicated by the paragraph heading``analysis,'' within which is given more detailed guidance as to the kindof discussion and examination that an FMP should contain to demonstrateconsistency with the standard in question. Words within these sectionswere carefully chosen to convey levels of effort and information commensuratewith need (<T3>e.g., </T3>``consider,'' ``take into account,'' ``explain,'' ``discuss,''``examine,'' ``analyze,'' ``identify.'') </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fishery management decisions affect the users of fish resources, thegovernment, and the individual taxpayer/consumer. Members of user groups,those responsible for implementing a fishery management regime, and thegeneral citizenry need to know the reasons for decisions that affect them.Thus, it is important that certain issues (particularly those that arecontroversial) undergo enough examination and discussion to illuminatethe options, demonstrate the rationales, and justify the final choice ofmanagement regime. This implicit democratic principle of accountabilityin government underlies and reinforces the Secretary's statutory responsibilityto make informed judgments regarding an FMP's consistency with the nationalstandards. The principle is reflected in the philosophies of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), and Executive Order (E.O.) 12291_allof which seek accountability in regulatory action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines contain a style guide, which explains the use of specificwords to distinguish the advisory, explanatory, or obligatory nature ofthe guideline language, and presents other words within the precise contextof the guidelines. The guidelines seek as much precision as possible inthe use of the words ``should'' and ``must''. ``Must'' is used to denotean obligation to act and is used primarily when referring to requirementsof the Act, the logical extension thereof, or other applicable law. ``Should''is used to indicate that an action or consideration is strongly recommendedto fulfill the Secretary's interpretation of the Act, and is a factor thatreviewers will look for in evaluating an FMP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines seek to provide options rather than establish requirements.Lists are not intended to be exclusive; they provide examples or illustrationsof the kind of information, discussion, or examination/analysis usefulin demonstrating consistency with the standard in question. The guidelinesalso seek to avoid universal application of a specific provision, exceptas required by law, so that the maximum accommodation to regional or individualfishery characteristics can be achieved within the standards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines make clear that FMPs in substantial compliance withthe guidelines, the Act, and other applicable law must be approved. Theguidelines are meant as a protection for everyone in the FMP system. Theiracceptance and use are a matter of practical utility for the Councils andof public commitment of the agency to consistent application of the policiesstated. As an aggregation of policies developed through creative Councilresponses to regional fishery management problems, they are a way of sharingthe empirical knowledge gained over the life of the Act. In summary, theguidelines are intended as an aid to decisionmaking, with responsible conservationand management of a valued national resource as the goal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Overview of the 1989 Revision </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Changes made in the guidelines since they were issued in 1983 addressnational standards l and 2 only, and were motivated largely by the need,articulated by the 1986 Fishery Management Study and others, for a conservationstandard. Consequently, changes in the guidelines emphasize the resource,not its allocation, and focus on overfishing, not on optimum yield (OY).Importantly, the guidelines do not change the relationship between thetwo as implied in the Act: While overfishing necessarily violates the Act'srequirement to achieve (OY), exceeding OY does not necessarily violatethe Act's prohibition of overfishing. If a stock is in good condition,the specification of OY may serve various goals besides prevention of overfishing.Exceeding the OY may interfere with achievement of those goals but notaffect the reproductive potential of the stock. On the other hand, if OYis the amount of fish that can safely be removed from the stock, exceedingOY may well constitute overfishing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The revised guidelines for standard 1 set forth a comprehensive overfishingconcept within which each Council must establish a specific, measurabledefinition of overfishing for each stock or stock complex covered by anFMP. That concept is based on the premise that irreversible damage to aresource's availability to recover in a reasonable period of time is unacceptable,and that fishing on a stock at a level that severely compromises that stock'sfuture productivity is counter to the goals of the Magnuson Act. Councilsare provided with the flexibility needed to develop a definition of overfishingappropriate to individual stocks or species, as long as it is defined ina way that allows the Councils and the Secretary to evaluate the conditionof the stock relative to the definition. General criteria are set forthas a basis for Secretarial review of the definition; these criteria addressthe overfishing definition specifically and do not change the Secretary'sobligation to review FMPs/amendments for consistency with all the nationalstandards, the Act, and other applicable law. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The revised guidelines for standard 2 describe a Stock Assessmentand Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) document or set of documents prepared oraggregated periodically, whereby Councils can obtain an objective overviewof the status of stocks and fisheries under management. The SAFE documentwould ideally include all the types of data necessary for the determinationof OY, as well as provide the basis for a Council's treatment of the overfishing/OYrelationship. While the Secretary has the responsibility for assuring thatthe SAFE report is produced, it is not intended to be exclusively authoredby NOAA. The report can be produced by any combination of talent from academic, government, or other sources. The report should be reviewed annually,but is not required to be revised annually except as there have been newdevelopments or significant changes in a fishery. The itemized examplesof data listed in this Appendix are not mandatory, but_as appropriate tothe fishery, taking into consideration the need to establish prioritieswithin budget constraints_the best available data must be addressed. SeveralCouncils currently produce such fishery reviews, which generally providethe kinds of information suggested in this Appendix under Standard 2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The SAFE report does not necessarily call for new information or newprocedures; the intent is to provide, in one reference, an aggregationor a summary of the best biological, social, economic, and ecological informationavailable to a Council when needed: (a) To determine annual harvest levelsor OYs for species in each fishery management unit (FMU), and (b) to evaluatethe effectiveness of its management in preventing overfishing as definedby the Council. Such a report can provide a useful tracking tool for assessingthe relative achievement of FMP objectives by establishing a time-seriesdata base indicating the relative health of stocks and the interests dependenton them. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Standard 1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Overfishing </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Overfishing is a relative term; it cannot be defined in isolationfrom its biological, social, economic, or ecological consequences, norfrom its relationship to given management objectives. The prevention ofoverfishing has as its general goal the protection of a stock's productivecapacity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Significant downward trends in spawning stock size or average annualrecruitment to the fishery may signal that overfishing is occurring, althoughsuch trends can also be symptomatic of other phenomena, for example thedevelopment of a new fishery. Ascertaining whether these trends signaloverfishing is a judgment based on scientific stock assessment, which inturn may be based on data obtained from harvesters and processors (throughlogbooks, catch samples, interviews, weigh-out slips, etc.), resource surveys,or other scientific research. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA also recognizes that a decline in stock size or abundance mayoccur independent of fishing pressure and that adverse changes in essentialhabitat may increase the risk that fishing effort will contribute to astock collapse. Regardless of the cause of a decline, however, the Actlimits a Council's authority in addressing the situation. The only directcontrol available under the Act is to adjust fishing mortality, which maybe accomplished in several ways (<T3>e.g., </T3>by establishing or adjusting time/area closures or limitson catch, mesh size, vessel days, or the number of vessels entering thefishery). If man-made environmental changes are contributing to the downwardtrends, in addition to controlling effort Councils should recommend restorationof habitat and other ameliorative programs, to the extent possible, andconsider whether to take action under section 302(i) of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Different fishing patterns can produce a variety of effects on localand areawide abundance, availability, size, and age composition of a stock.Some of these fishing patterns have been called ``growth,'' ``localized,''or ``pulse'' overfishing; however, these patterns are not necessarily overfishingunder national standard 1. A Council may recommend conservation and managementmeasures to prevent or permit these effects, depending on the objectivesof a particular FMP and the specific definition of overfishing establishedfor the stock or stock complex under management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The term ``growth overfishing'' often refers to the practice of takingtoo many fish from a cohort (year class) before the cohort has attainedits maximum potential biomass. The term can also refer to harvesting ata fishing mortality rate in excess of that which maximizes the expectedyield from a cohort given a particular age or size of recruitment. ``Growthoverfishing'' can be practiced deliberately, for example to capitalizeon demand for a smaller product, or inadvertently, for example by usingnonselective gear. ``Growth overfishing'' may be discouraged or disallowedby regulating fishing gear or imposing time/area closures, to force fishingon larger or more marketable fish. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Localized overfishing'' occurs when a stock is depleted within aconfined portion of its range. For example, this fishing pattern can occurin reef fisheries when concentrated fishing pressure reduces the populationof a species or species complex inhabiting a particular reef or reef complex.An important characteristic of this fishing pattern is that it is oftentemporary; if fishing effort is reduced sufficiently, the remainder ofthe stock can often repopulate the depleted portion, reversing the condition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Pulse overfishing'' can be tolerated under certain conditions. Forexample, it can sometimes be desirable for economic and social reasonsto take a large amount of fish in a short time, and then to let the stockrecover. In general, the key point in terms of national standard 1 is notso much the pattern of fishing (<T3>e.g.</T3>, pulse vs. sustained) as the rate of fishing mortality andits effect on the long-term capacity of the stock to produce MSY. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As management regimes become more comprehensive, the interrelationshipsof fishing pressures on target and nontarget (as well as major and minor)species will have to be addressed more directly. In determining allowablefishing levels, Councils should consider all sources of mortality on astock, including non-targeted fishing, discards, and illegal catch. Becauseall removals from the stock, whether landed or unlanded, will affect spawningstock biomass levels now or in the near future, Councils should attemptto obtain estimates of all sources of mortality and consider these estimatesin adjusting directed fishing levels. While the general expectation isfor total fishing mortality on a stock to be managed such that overfishingdoes not occur, NOAA believes that rational management of multispeciesfisheries includes acknowledgement of the fact that overharvesting minorcomponents of these fisheries may be allowable in certain cases. The guidelinesemphasize that such cases are characterized by two necessary conditions:(1) That analysis demonstrates positive net benefits to the Nation willresult from overfishing the minor component(s), and (2) that such overharvestwill not cause any stock to require protection under the Endangered SpeciesAct. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA believes that the overfishing sections of the guidelines areresponsive to the findings of the Act and to subsequent studies urginga conservation standard_particularly when read in conjunction with theanalysis provisions throughout the guidelines, and with the standard 6guideline provisions for buffers, reserves, and framework FMP flexibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Maximum Sustainable Yield </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Much of the past controversy concerning MSY has related to its adequacyas a management goal. As used in the Act, however, calculation of MSY isa only a baseline step in the overall process of determining OY. Recognizingthat MSY must represent the underlying biological rationale for determinationof OY in a wide variety of fisheries, the guidelines set forth a flexibleframework for its calculation. Recognition of the need for flexibilityin calculating MSY has come as a result of FMP review experience and Councilinnovation in adapting this concept to the characteristics of differentfisheries. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is clear that every attempt should be made to satisfy the Act'srequirement for specification of MSY. However, there may be cases wherescarcity of data or tentativeness of scientific understanding renders MSYspecification impossible, or where biological resiliency or high fecundityof some stocks or other fishery characteristic may allow OY to become adescriptive statement only_making a numerical calculation of MSY unnecessary.In such cases, NOAA believes that Congressional intent is served if OYderives from the best biological information available, <T3>e.g.</T3>, the proportional abundance of associated species. DescriptiveOYs should be convertible to annual numerical estimates for the purposeof deriving the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a subsequent step in the process of determining OY, MSY may beadjusted (deviated from) for economic, social, or ecological reasons. Onetype of adjustment is illustrated by the concept of biologically acceptablecatch (ABC), used by some Councils. ABC is an annually determined numberthat may be set lower or higher than MSY for a number of reasons, <T3>e.g.</T3>, to take advantage of abnormally high recruitment, to allowrebuilding of stocks, or to be conservative when there are inadequate dataon the status of the stocks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Optimum Yield </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA believes it important to keep the distinction clear between thetwo separate parts of standard 1: To prevent overfishing, and to achieveOY. The guidelines are written such that overfishing is an intrinsic limitationon OY; it is built into the OY determination, yet maintains a separateidentity as a constraint. For example, exceeding a stock's OY by a smallamount typically does not constitute overfishing when the stock is healthy.On the other hand, exceeding OY can coincidentally constitute overfishingwhen the margins of tolerance are low. Buffers to protect against overfishingbecause of uncertainty in estimating stock size or domestic harvest maybe established in the form of reserves or a reduced OY. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Regardless of whether sustained harvesting at a level above OY constitutesoverfishing, such a harvest pattern violates the Act's requirement to achieveOY on a continuing basis. In other words, national standard 1 is violatedwhenever the level of harvest is consistently and significantly differentfrom OY, irrespective of whether that harvest level is above or below OY.While recognizing that OY might not be achieved every year in practice,NOAA believes that Councils must make every reasonable attempt to see thatit is.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines also state that in the case of a mixed species fishery,the OY for incidental species may be a function of the directed catch,or absorbed into an OY for related species. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA believes that achievement of OY includes giving foreign fishingvessels reasonable opportunity to harvest the portion of the OY (TALFF)that would not otherwise be harvested by vessels of the United States.However, nothing precludes Councils from setting OY equal to DAH (effectivelyeliminating TALFF), if circumstances warranting such action are documented.For example, international economic concerns may influence the size ofTALFF through their consideration as modifying factors in the determinationof OY. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Standard 2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Application of this standard affects the operation of all the otherstandards. The quantity and quality of scientific information influencethe establishment of MSY, OY, and management unit composition; they underlieallocative determinations, judgments of efficiency, adjustments for variationsand contingencies, and evaluations of costs and benefits. The guidelinesaddress the questions of timeliness, opposing bodies of opinion, and practicalutility of the information specified, and emphasize the continuing needfor information for monitoring and in-season adjustment decisions undera flexible management regime. A voluntary system of data collection ispermissible, but requires a justification under the Paperwork ReductionAct, and is not covered under the Act's confidentiality provision. It isacceptable to collect data within State boundaries when needed for properimplementation of an FMP, but duplication of effort should be avoided.Successful data collection depends on the protection of confidential data,the public trust in that protection, and the public perception of the validuses of those data. The validity of the entire process may hinge on thecooperative attitudes of constituents, the research community, and therelevant governmental institutions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The SAFE Report provides Councils with a summary of the biologicalcondition of species in the FMU, and the social and economic conditionof recreational and commercial fishing interests and fish processing industries.The SAFE report summarizes, on a periodic basis, the best available scientificinformation concerning the past, present, and possible future conditionof the stocks and fisheries being managed under Federal regulation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to base harvestspecifications, such as: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Estimates of total biomass and/or spawning biomass for each stockin the FMU; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Estimates of the annual surplus production (ASP) and MSY for eachstock in the FMU; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Description of the estimated biomass, ASP, and MSY in previousyears relative to those estimates for the current or next year; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Description of the model or assumptions on which these estimatesare based and a discussion of the reliability of each estimate; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) If a stock is depleted, estimated time necessary to allow thestock to rebuild to the MSY-producing level, threshold level, or otherspecified level under various harvest levels and prevailing environmentalconditions; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) Significant changes (if any) in the habitat or ecosystem sinceit was last described in the FMP, an amendment to the FMP, or previousSAFE report. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to assessthe economic and social condition of persons and businesses that rely onrecreational and commercial use of fish resources, including fish processingindustries, such as: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Estimate of the amount of fish harvested from each stock in theFMU, by gear type and area, in the most recent 3 years and in the yearimmediately prior to implementation of the FMP governing fisheries for(or in) the FMU.

The emphasis in the revisionis on the scope, composition, and unity of the management unit, and oncoordination and cooperation rather than on potential jurisdictional tension.NOAA believes that range-wide planning should encourage active State participationin the planning process, and that such planning will provide clear directionto the States as to what is needed to implement the proposed managementregime effectively. This is consistent with Council practice; the resultshould be greater compatibility between Federal and State management measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the potential for incompatibility does exist, however, theguidelines require an FMP to discuss the interrelationship between Statemanagement activities and the proposed Federal regime. Federal regulationssupersede any conflicting State regulations of FCZ fishing (F/V AmericanEagle v. Alaska, No. 2227 (Alaska, Nov. 21, 1980)). State landing lawsand other forms of indirect regulation of FCZ fishing may be affected byimplementing an FMP. The required analysis focuses attention on these impactsand on the effect of inconsistent State action on attaining the objectivesof the FMP. This latter discussion will assist in determining Secretarialresponsibilities under section 306(b) of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3 calls for management of a ``stock'' throughout its range.NOAA feels that the use of the words ``stock,'' ``fishery,'' and ``managementunit'' is significant, and has endeavored to use the appropriate term inthe guidelines. A stock may be larger than the fishery, as is the casewhen only a portion of the stock is actively fished. A fishery may be largerthan a stock, when more than one stock is fished together. The managementunit may ignore a portion of fishery or stock when it includes a transboundaryfishery or when a minor portion of the unit is fished within the area ofauthority of another Council. Examples are given of the perspectives aroundwhich a management unit may be organized. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Standard 4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To assist Councils in making what are usually the most controversialdecisions within an FMP, NOAA has tried to confront the human issues surroundingfishery management directly, consistent with its concern for the economicand social consequences of regulation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines address the ``discrimination among residents of differentStates'' issue as an extension of the Federal privilege and immunities''clause of the U.S. Constitution, which means that Councils may not relyon, nor incorporate within an FMP, a State law that discriminates againstresidents of a different State. Discrimination is a distinct concept fromequity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fishery management is essentially a series of allocations among presentusers, between present and future users, between public and private interests.The guidelines define ``allocation'' for purposes of the standard as adirect and deliberate distribution of the opportunity to participate ina fishery among identifiable, discrete groups of fishermen. Because onlymeasures that meet the definition will be judged against the standard,this is a critical and sensitive differentiation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many management measures may have an <T3>incidental</T3> effect on the fishing privileges enjoyed by differentgroups of U.S. fishermen. Any quota has a distributive effect on presentand future users through its impact on stock maintenance or rebuilding.Area closures may cause practical difficulties for smaller vessels or thoselocated far from open areas. Seasonal quotas create difficulties for thosewhose economics of operation do not permit a long period of inactivity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Direct</T3> allocations, by contrast, have been made by the severalCouncils in a variety of FMPs in the past: Quotas by classes of vessels(Atlantic groundfish), quotas for commercial and recreational fishermen(Atlantic mackerel), different fishing seasons for recreational and commercialfishermen (salmon), assignment of ocean areas to different gears (stonecrab), and limiting permits to present users (surf clam). These directallocations were approved under standard 4 because the Councils compliedwith the three statutory criteria of the standard in constructing theirallocation schemes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guideline's definition is an attempted middle ground between allmeasures affecting fishing practices and measures designated as allocationsin an FMP. The distribution must be direct and deliberate, but a Councilcould not disclaim an intent to allocate through a measure that had obviousand inevitable allocative effects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA believes that the required analysis of allocations and alternativeschemes considered_including the status quo_will help to focus attentionon the existing distribution of privileges and the alteration of that distributionwhich Federal management will impose. Each FMP should contain the Council'sjudgment on fairness and equity, conservation promotion, and possible monopolisticor oligopolistic effects of the proposed allocations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines link ``fairness'' with FMP objectives and OY and acknowledgethat fishing rights of treaty Indians and aboriginal Americans should befactored into Council judgments. Rational use of the resource is suggestedas one way an allocation scheme may promote conservation. A more visibleconservation purpose is illustrated by the moratorium on entry of new vesselsinto the surf clam fishery, initiated to mitigate a resource crisis ina stock. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Standard 5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA believes that, for purposes of standard 5, efficiency can bedefined as the ability to produce a desired effect or product (or achievean objective) with a minimum of effort, costs, or misuse of valuable biologicaland economic resources. In other words, Councils should choose managementmeasures that achieve the FMP's objectives with minimum cost and burdenson society. NOAA believes that particular care should be taken when consideringmanagement of common property resources_where intensive individual marketactions risk the ``tragedy of the commons,'' a concept that comprises damagenot only to the individual fisherman, but to the very resource on whichhe depends. Where there are no property rights, the role of governmenttakes on the dimension of stewardship. NOAA also believes that managingat least cost to society and managing at least cost to the fisherman arenot mutually exclusive. NOAA reads standards 5 and 7 together; to minimizecosts of regulating also means to minimize costs to the industry of compliance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The guidelines also recognize the difficulty inherent in reconcilingparticular economic and social needs of industry participants and consumerswith this goal of efficiency. For example, maximizing employment opportunitiesby allowing continued overcapitalization instead of reducing effort mightbe considered inefficient in terms of an economic goal, but not necessarilyin terms of a social goal. Or, when it is necessary to preserve a subsistenceway of life or enjoyment of recreational fishing, application of the efficiencystandard may not be appropriate. Councils thus may have to choose between_orrank_competing objectives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA believes that an FMP should not restrict the use of productiveand cost-effective techniques of harvesting, processing or marketing, unlesssuch restriction is necessary to achieve the conservation or social objectivesof the FMP. For example, the Pacific salmon FMP provides for use of a barblesshook to decrease mortality of sublegal coho and chinook. The high seassalmon FMP requires heads on'' landing for fin-clipped coho and chinookto insure recovery of coded wire tags used to establish a needed distributiondata base. In both cases, reduction in efficiency was outweighed by theconservation benefit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Administrative efficiency can be a factor in choosing between managementregime alternatives, as well. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp FMP's cooperativeTexas closure, for example, increased the effectiveness and efficiencyof enforcement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA chose to address the questions surrounding ``limited access''in the context of standard 5 rather than in standard 4, even though limitedaccess, by its nature, is an allocative measure. In fact, the guidelinescaution that any limited access system must be consistent with section303(b)(6) of the Act and the standard 4 guidelines. NOAA believes thatplacement within standard 5 puts the emphasis more appropriately on conceptsof economic efficiency in achieving OY rather than on the contentious issuesof right of entry, or limit on effort, per se. The placing of limited accesswithin the standard 5 context does not imply, however, that efficiencyis always attained by limited access, nor that limited access is the mostdesirable method of attaining efficiency, nor that efficiency is the onlypurpose for limited access, nor that limited entry has always resultedin the benefits listed in the guidelines. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Standard 6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA recognizes that each fishery exhibits unique uncertainties, andthat the unpredictable nature of the fishery resource caused by vulnerabilityto changing conditions and unforeseeable events makes long-term planningdifficult. Long-term objectives are more easily attainable in the morestable fisheries. The guidelines clarify that it is possible to compensatefor variations by establishing buffers; protection against contingenciesis urged through use of flexibility in the regulatory process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Standard 7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The principles of standard 7 coincide with many earnest and recentlyintense efforts of NOAA and the Councils to streamline the FMP process.As more FMPs have come on line, the costs of enforcement and of collectingdata for monitoring, while reduced per FMP, have increased in total. Therising costs of fishing, due in part to dependence on petroleum-based products,has intensified the need to consider the impact of potentially burdensomeregulations. Thus, it has become necessary to be more precise in evaluatingthe costs to industry and to government, to support comprehensive management,and to work toward a flexible regulatory structure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> NOAA believes that the requirements of E.O. 12291 and other regulatoryreform legislation quite appropriately focus attention on the thresholdquestion of the actual need for management through regulation. Even whena Council believes there is an advantage to managing a fishery, growingpublic concern over excessive Federal regulation of private activitiesand over the need to reduce the cost of government emphasizes the responsibilityto ensure that FMPs are developed only for those fisheries where the needfor Federal regulation can be clearly demonstrated. For these reasons,the guidelines propose criteria to assist in making these threshold decisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NOAA recognizes that the wide diversity of fisheries and of managementobjectives increases the difficulties of devising a quantitative cost/benefitanalysis for fishery management measures. However, under the guidelines,the types of analyses suggested under standards 4 and 5 would be the firststeps in evaluating relative distribution of gains and burdens producedby each alternative set of management measures. While weight of intangiblessuch as recreational enjoyment, habitat protection, or social dislocationoften cannot be expressed in dollar terms, NOAA believes they should beconsidered and described as explicitly as possible. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-17017 Filed 7-21-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-22-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
