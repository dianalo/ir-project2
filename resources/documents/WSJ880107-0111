The bank holding company said the charge will reduce per-share earnings for the quarter about 70 cents but won't prevent payment of the quarterly dividend. The payout recently was increased 20% to 36 cents a common share.    Net income was $35.7 million, or 86 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter and $134.9 million, or $3.44 a share, in 1986.    The latest charge brings to $100 million the total international loan loss charged to 1987 earnings. National City said the allocated reserve equals about 64% of its $172 million of medium-term and long-term exposure to less-developed countries. These loans are less than 2% of its total loans, it said.    The allocated reserve is 50% of the company's total $220 million exposure in less-developed nations, including trade-related financing and other short-term credit, National City said. In the past year it reduced its total exposure in less-developed nations from $290 million while building its allocated reserve by $100 million, it said.    National City also said it placed all of its exposure to non-oil-exporting, less-developed countries on non-accrual, bringing the total less-developed nation non-accrual portfolio to $63 million.    &quot;National City took these actions in light of the increasing concern over the last six months that many of these countries' debts may not be fully serviced,&quot; said Edward Brandon, chairman, president and chief executive officer. </TEXT></DOC>
