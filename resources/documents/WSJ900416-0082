Goldman is trying to raise at least $500 million,including $100 million of its own, for a fund that wouldinvest large amounts of cash in a small number of financiallytroubled companies.</LP><TEXT>   The effort has raised eyebrows among bankruptcy investors,who question whether a securities firm known for shunninghostile takeovers will prosper in the often-hostile world ofrestructurings.   Bankruptcy specialists say Goldman is straying from itsturf. They question whether the firm will be able to raisemoney for such ventures. They also appear less than eager tohave Goldman as competition.   Goldman isn't alone in trying to raise money fordistressed companies, but its prospective fund is the biggestand -- for its brethren on Wall Street -- the mostsignificant. Investment banks are hungry to get into thebusiness of cleaning up the debt-ridden balance sheets theyhelped create in the 1980s, but raising money for suchventures hasn't proved easy.   &quot;Everyone is looking to see if Goldman can pull it off,&quot;says Chriss Street of the Reorganized Securities Group in LosAngeles. &quot;If they can, everyone else will announcesomething.&quot;   Goldman's aim is no less than to test the thesis of theday -- namely, that Wall Street can make money from investingin, or restructuring, the walking wounded survivors (ornon-survivors) of the leveraged buy-out era. Although Goldmanhas been an adviser to Southland, a textbook case of theproblem it aims to cure, the investment bank's record on LBOsis better than most.   The potential market, Goldman's sales memorandum notes, isstocked with victims of &quot;LBO misjudgments, over-optimisticprojections and over-valuations.&quot;   The market is likely to grow in an economic downturn.   &quot;It's the flip side of the Milken Revolution,&quot; says DavidSchulte, managing partner of Chilmark Partners in Chicago,who is co-sponsoring a competing turnaround fund that isaiming to raise at least $250 million.   So far, the thesis has attracted more talk than actualinvestment. &quot;For all the discussion of such funds there hasbeen very little investor appetite,&quot; says Wilbur Ross, seniormanaging director of Rothschild Inc. and a specialist inrestructurings.   Goldman's bankers say they can't comment during theoffering period. But judging from the terms of its salesmemorandum, Goldman is optimistic. It is banking on raisingat least $100 million by June 15 -- less than 90 days fromthe date of its private placement offering memorandum, whichis dated March 22. And it is committed to raising more moneythan others have attempted or to giving the funds back. T.Rowe Price, for instance, took about a year to raise $107million for its Recovery Fund.   Goldman's fund is the Water Street Corporate Recovery FundI. The name suggests that Goldman aims for II and III downthe road. It is aimed at institutions willing to invest aminimum of $5 million for four to seven years.   The sales memo says the firm plans to buy securities offinancially troubled companies &quot;on a basis that may enable itto influence the recapitalization of those companies.&quot; Itaims, in other words, to buy big enough stakes in securities-- usually bonds -- to be able to force things in its favorwhen companies are restructured.   Martin J. Whitman, a longtime bankruptcy investor, says,&quot;The business as we do it has confrontation built into it.It's very hard to be successful if your mind-set is to workwith management. The whiteshoe firms aren't equipped to doit.&quot;   Mr. Whitman doesn't snipe at Goldman's resources, or atits name. But, he notes, Goldman prides itself on not doinghostile deals, and workouts are rarely friendly.   Goldman acknowledges in its memo that in acting as both aninvestment banker and as an investor, it may have to treadthrough a thicket of conflicts of interests. It notes, forinstance, a &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; problem; Water Street might beunable to invest in securities if Goldman has insideinformation on them.   The memo is silent on whether Water Street will buy bondsof Goldman clients. But, it says, the fund's adviser &quot;willtake into consideration (Goldman's relationships withclients) in its management of the Fund.&quot;   Presumably, it will look for companies troubled by excessdebt rather than by inferior management. According to thememo, Goldman believes the combined power of the fund'scapital, Goldman's nose for value and Goldman's investmentbanking talents should produce dynamic results.   The fund plans to &quot;assume an active investment role,acquire substantial positions and seize initiatives,&quot; thememo says. &quot;Its ability to recognize values must be coupledwith the investment banking capability to effectrestructurings.&quot;   Skeptics note that the fund's managers are corporatefinance generalists more than loan-workout specialists andthat Goldman's own record in investing in distressedcompanies appears to be spotty. It has, apparently, prosperedin Penrod Drilling, but not in Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel.   Goldman's competition, on the other hand, includeslongtime bankruptcy specialists. Mr. Schulte, for instance,is raising money with Sam Zell. Both men are veteran&quot;workout&quot; artists, experts in restructuring problem loans.Joseph, Littlejohn andamp; Levy, also a workout specialist, istrying to raise $300 million, for another fund to be managedby Lancer Industries.   Both funds would seek distressed companies for investmentsand operate them for the long term. The Zell fund, raisingmoney with Merrill Lynch, has a lifetime of 10 to 12 years.&quot;We will stick around and operate,&quot; Mr. Zell says. &quot;Thisisn't a flip deal.&quot;   The time horizon of Water Street is shorter than Mr.Zell's. Water Street's investments would be held, it expects,from one to three years. It appears to be looking forcompanies with management in place -- but in need offinancial engineering.   Goldman's bankers, were they available to speak,presumably would add that the firm is no stranger to advisingworkout clients. Goldman's sales pitch, in its memo, alsocites its LBO fund, the Broad Street Investment Fund. ByGoldman's estimate, the fund has been earning better than a35% annual compound return since 1986. The implicit pitch isthat if Goldman didn't stumble too often in the LBO era, itshould be able to play doctor to those who did.   ---                 Bankruptcies Balloon . . .
