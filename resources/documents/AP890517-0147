April precipitation was below average or well-below averagethroughout the region except in the Pacific Northwest and Montana,he said. Consequently, seasonal forecasts have been reduced in mostbasin areas.   ``Early runoff improved reservoir storage dramatically,''Scaling said. ``However, inflows have already begun to taper off inmany basins.''   April precipitation was less than 50 percent of average in theSouthwest, except for pockets of above-average precipitation insouthern Arizona, southeastern New Mexico and central Colorado.   Streamflow forecasts have been reduced throughout the Westthrough September, Scaling said. However, near-average flows areexpected for most rivers in Oregon, as well as for the UpperColumbia, the Upper Snake and along the mainstem of the YellowstoneRiver.   Nevada is the only state where reservoir storage is well-belowaverage, he said. Summer inflows to reservoirs are likely to bebelow-average in all Western states.   The West depends on snow melt for about 75 percent of its watersupply.</TEXT></DOC>
