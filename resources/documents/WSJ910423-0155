The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will callrepresentatives of 315 companies to its Tokyo headquartersand regional offices on Thursday to urge them to attain the10% growth target, officials said. In March, Japanese importsfrom the U.S. dropped 1.9% from year-earlier levels. Importsfrom Europe edged down 0.3%, and those from newlyindustrialized economies, including South Korea and Taiwan,declined 10%.   The Japanese government recently revised its taxregulations to give preferential treatment to encourageimports.   Imported cigarette sales in the year ended March 31 jumped11% to 51.1 billion. This represented 16% of the record 322billion smokes sold in Japan, a 2.6% rise from a year earlierthat was attributed to stable prices and the growing numberof adults. Sales of Japanese-made cigarettes rose only 1.2%to 270.9 billion. Imports of paper cups and plates throughYokohama in the three months through March jumped 43%, owingto cost advantages, a boom in public events, and vendingmachine popularity.                                                                                                          WAS HUNGARY A NUCLEAR CLOSET?                                                                                                          The Soviets stored nuclear weapons in Hungary for apossible attack on the West until the end of the 1980s, undera secret agreement with Hungary's late Communist leader JanosKadar, former Premier Karoly Grosz said. Mr. Grosz told theAssociated Press he didn't know how many or what types ofnuclear devices were stored in Hungary, which was part of thenow effectively defunct Warsaw Pact that bound Eastern Europeto Moscow. The arms were withdrawn after his successor tookoffice in late 1988, he said.                                                                                                          IRAQI AIR FLIGHTS TO RESUME                                                                                                          Iraqi Airways plans to resume next month domestic flightsthat were grounded by the Gulf war. Allied air attacks inJanuary halted the carrier's domestic flights, and the UnitedNations embargo last August interrupted internationalservice. Most of Iraq's major airports had bomb damage. OfIraqi Airways' 68 planes, 27 remain in Iran.                                                                                                          TANKERS FLEE SPAIN'S WATERS                                                                                                          All six ships anchored in the Gulf of Cadiz left Spain'sterritorial waters in reaction to stiff new regulations ontanker safety, prompted by last week's tanker explosion offItaly. Madrid now requires any tanker in its waters to reportto authorities every four hours, confirm the ship's locationevery 15 minutes, hire tugboats to be on emergency standby,and get clearance before any hull cleaning. Shipping brokerssaid complying with the new rules could cost as much as 2.5million pesetas ($23,348) a day.                                                                                                          THIRD WORLD'S GROWTH SURVEYED                                                                                                          Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan are expected to have theThird World's highest economic growth rates in the next fiveyears, with Argentina and the Ivory Coast at the bottom amongthe 36 Asian, African and Latin American countries surveyedby the Prognos Center of Basel, Switzerland. The averageannual growth rate of the 36 nations is expected to be 4%until 1995, compared with a world-wide average of about 3%,the survey found.                                                                                                          ROMANIA MAKES A CURRENCY MOVE                                                                                                          Bucharest banned selling goods for hard currency, in amove aimed at achieving internal convertibility of theRomanian leu within six months. After May 3, only specialshops selling imported products to diplomats and otherforeign nationals will continue to accept hard currency. Themove will force importers who have sprung up since theDecember 1989 fall of the Communist dictatorship to buy hardcurrency from the national bank. The leu doesn't have auniform rate of exchange abroad, and many banks refuse to buyit.                                                                                                          FRANCE TO GET TWO-DECK TRAINS                                                                                                          The French railway authority ordered high-speed,double-deck cars to improve passenger capacity. SocieteNationale des Chemins de Fer, or SNCF, awarded the job,valued at as much as 10 billion francs ($1.71 billion), to aconsortium led by the Franco-British concern GEC-Alsthom N.V.   The new coaches will increase capacity to 520 passengersfrom 350 on the single-level trains in the Train GrandeVitesse network. TGV trains can travel at 190 miles per hour.The first double-deck train is to be delivered in 1994 byGEC-Alsthom, a venture of Alcatel Alsthom of France andGeneral Electric Co. of Britain, and ANF Industrie S.A., aFrench unit of Bombardier Inc. of Canada, and De DietrichS.A. of France.   The bigger cars are designed to ease increasing saturationon some of SNCF's high-speed train routes, notably insoutheastern France.   SNCF has said it intends to invest $34 billion over thenext 20 years to build 2,750 miles of high-speed track, morethan doubling what it calls the world's most advanced railsystem.
