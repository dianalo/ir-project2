Japan's growing reputation in the Third World as a promised landis attracting workers from Pakistan and Bangladesh who can earn asmuch in a day as they can in weeks or even months back home.   Chinese eager to make their fortune come posing as Vietnameseboat people in hopes of gaining political asylum, and Africansignore local prejudices against blacks to earn money to send home.   The estimated 100,000 or so illegal workers and tens ofthousands of working foreign students have an influence far beyondtheir numbers in a population of 120 million.   Tokyo commuter trains used to be a sea of smooth black hair andfamiliar Japanese faces; everyone talked the same language. Nowoccasional black and dark brown faces and strange tongues aremaking Japanese fidget in their seats.   Heavy television coverage of boat people and foreign workers isbringing the issue into the living rooms of millions, whilehundreds of thousands are working side by side with non-Japanesefor the first time.   Some press comment has been thoughtful.   ``Is it possible for us to enjoy such affluence separate fromthe rest of the world, especially the people of neighboringcountries?'' Mainichi Shimbun said in an editorial.   But other writers, noting the 1 billion people in neighboringChina, have raised visions of aliens pouring in faster thanMexicans to the United States. Letters to the editor pages havebeen flooded with fears of cultural invasion, crime and crowding.   A 150-minute television program on foreign workers by JapanBroadcasting Corp. in May brought calls from 1,000 viewers _ 20times the usual number for such programs, a local press reportsaid. For every person arguing to let in foreign workers, two saidit was a bad idea.   ``Foreign Workers Will Destroy Japan'' is the subtitle of a bookby critic Kanji Nishio. The book, with a large padlock pictured onthe cover, is called ``Recommendation for a Closed Country (Sakoku)in Labor,'' using the same word that shoguns used to ban foreignersfrom Japanese shores for centuries.   Generally favoring entry for foreign workers are smallbusinessmen, thousands of whom have gone bankrupt because of asevere labor shortage. For part-time jobs in such fields asconstruction and restaurants, openings outnumber available workersthree or four to one.   Owners of small labor-intensive factories have deluged refugeeauthorities with job offers for the boat people, even as massdeportations are being arranged.   ``If it weren't for these foreign workers, we'd go under,'' saysKenichi Masuda. In his family's century-old cast-iron foundry,elderly Japanese blackened from head to toe with soot shovel cokefrom the dirt floor into a furnace and pour molten iron into moldsin a dimly lit wooden building.   ``Young Japanese don't want to do this dangerous, dirty work,''Masuda shouts above the clank of machinery, pointing out a Chineseworking for him legally on a government training program.   At a neighboring foundry, 29-year-old Paul Aduna from Ghana inAfrica works for 900 yen ($6.42) an hour under the same program,originally designed to transfer manufacturing skills to developingcountries.   At 6:30 a.m., at a recruiting center for day laborers in Tokyo,crew-cut construction foremen pass over the few aging Japanese menreclining on cardboard and reeking of alcohol.   Young, eager, neatly dressed Chinese students wave away an offerof 800 yen (about $6) an hour, about 25 times what they'd make inChina.   ``Too cheap. He's crazy,'' one says.   With an offer of 1,250 yen (about $9), the Chinese pile into avan to be taken to a construction site.   ``I used to work in New York,'' says ``George,'' a Malaysian whoasked that his name not be used. ``But the money is a lot betterhere.''   In the sprawling neon jungle of Kabukicho, Tokyo's answer to NewYork's 42nd Street, thousands of women from the Philippines,Thailand and Korea work in bars, sex shows and prostitution, mostbrought in by Japanese gangsters.   In Tokyo's immigration office, Thais, Ghanaians, Bangladeshis,Pakistanis and Chinese stand in endless lines, hoping in a Babel oflanguages to persuade bureaucrats to let them stay a few moremonths.   Most foreign laborers work illegally after entry on touristvisas or student visas that allow only part-time work. Unlike manydeveloped countries, Japan has no legal provision to allowforeigners to enter as unskilled laborers.   Big business and the government want to keep it that way.Although small businesses lobby the government to allow moreforeign workers, industry leaders argue for greater investment inmachines to solve labor shortages.   Even many Japanese who want foreign workers for temporary helpworry that they will settle here and disturb Japan's ``socialharmony.'' But many of the foreigners, stung by Japanese prejudice,say they don't want to stay.   A 25-year-old Chinese woman said she came in part because ofJapan's reputation as an advanced country, in part because of the``Japan millionaires'' returning to her hometown to build bighouses and flourishing businesses with their Tokyo earnings.   A Japanese-Chinese translator in China, she and her technicianhusband came on student visas and work long hours after classes.Their dream, she says, was to ``learn about Japanese business andtechnology and build a powerful Japanese-style conglomerate back inChina'' _ or at least save some money and start a small business.   But now, after months working in a dry cleaning shop and then ina Japanese pub, she says she's disappointed in a country she usedto admire, even though she earns in a day what would take a monthin China.   ``Materially the Japanese are very advanced, but notspiritually,'' she says. ``If you are white, they treat you well.But if you are dark-skinned or Asian, they look down on you.''   She said some coworkers taunted her after they saw Chinese boatpeople on television, saying, ``Why don't your people stay wherethey belong?''   ``I tell them we are like bus, no matter how many you squash,more come back,'' she said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday AMs, Nov. 6</NOTE></DOC>
