The properties of the targetswere studied using the {gamma}-ray yields of (p,{gamma}) reactions inducedon the target nuclides. It is found that the implantation technique providesa good means for the production of isotopically enriched targets capableof withstanding high beam loads. Some applications of these targets arediscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
