The Slough of Despond?    Famous as it may be among bog lovers, the swamp in John Bunyan's 17th-century tale &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot; would hardly make most teachers' list of the basics that children should learn in school. Or even a list of what the average educated person knows.    But the Slough (pronounced sloo) made the list that has them buzzing in academia this fall -- E.D. Hirsch Jr.'s list of &quot;what every American needs to know.&quot; Also among the catalog of essentials are Akron, Ohio, dog in the manger, Robert's Rules of Order and, also under &quot;R,&quot; -- &quot;regret that I have but one life to lose for my country, I only . . . &quot;    Mr. Hirsch doesn't identify Nathan Hale as the source ofthe quotation, and he doesn't explain the inclusion of thedog in the manger -- or Akron, Ohio. We should already knowall of that, he suggests.   If Mr. Hirsch has his way, learning about the slough, Akron and the rest -- a total of 4,500 words, places, names, dates, and phrases first published in his best-selling book, &quot;Cultural Literacy&quot; -- will soon become part of students' basic curriculum between kindergarten and the 12th grade.    This prospect has its supporters, including some of the top people at the U.S. Department of Education. But to many educators, this is one academic question that is anything but academic.    The list and Mr. Hirsch's plan to propagate it are:    --&quot;A kind of educational fascism,&quot; asserts Jack Nachbar, professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio.    --&quot;Totally inadequate,&quot; insists Wayne Booth, one of the English faculty at the University of Chicago.    --&quot;Right up there with 'New Math,'&quot; wrote Craig Bowman, a junior-high-school teacher in Denver, in the Rocky Mountain News. &quot;Another version of all those harebrained ideas of the '60s and '70s that purportedly would solve everything from poverty to adolescent nasal excavations.&quot;    Retorts Mr. Hirsch, heedless of a bit of wisdom in his &quot;S&quot; listings (&quot;soft answer turneth away wrath, A . . . &quot;):    &quot;They can grouse all they want. But there is a body of knowledge worth sharing, and if we don't share it, we will fail educationally, and if we fail educationally, we will fail politically and economically. And we will also fail to close the social gap.&quot;    With the surprise success of &quot;Cultural Literacy,&quot; Mr. Hirsch, an English professor at the University of Virginia, has earned credits in the educational-reform movement. Now in its 10th printing, the book has sold 155,000 copies in hard cover since April and has been among the 10 best-selling books in the country since June, astounding both Mr. Hirsch and his publisher, Houghton Mifflin Co.    Mr. Hirsch's theory is that illiteracy is growing because schools don't teach the basics that define the culture, depriving children of the context they need to read and learn, even from things as simple as newspaper articles.    The inspiration for the book came partly from studies showing what Mr. Hirsch calls &quot;astonishing ignorance&quot; among students. A recent federally financed survey of 17-year-olds found that 40% didn't know that the bombing of Pearl Harbor took place between 1939 and 1943. One out of five said the telephone was invented after 1950.    As a prescriptive, Mr. Hirsch offers the list. And if he and his critics agree on one thing, it is that the list is arbitrary. The Beatles made it, Frank Sinatra didn't. Tolstoy, da; Dostoevski, nyet. Jesse and Stonewall have the right stuff among the Jacksons, not Michael.    The list is supposed to approximate what a newspaper reporter can write without explaining it. The vast majority of the entries, which appear undefined and unexplained, are simple. But there are also some esoterica that wouldn't clear an editor's desk without explanation.    &quot;Dog in the manger,&quot; in fact, failed to clear the editor's desk in this case, so for such cultural illiterates, the expression refers to a person who commits a spiteful act like that of the dog in the Aesop fable that bites the ox to keep it from eating the hay, although the hay isn't of any use to the dog.    Other entries that wouldn't get by most editors: manumission, Brownian motion, the Congress of Vienna, and Occam's razor. (Respectively: liberation, the random movement of solid bits in liquid, the parley that ended the Napoleonic Wars, and a method of reducing an argument to its basic logical components.)    Sound like a popular board game? It could soon become one, says Houghton Mifflin. &quot;One of the working names is Non-Trivial Pursuits,&quot; quips John Latimer, one of the editors working on follow-ups to the book. By next year, Houghton promises a &quot;dictionary&quot; of cultural literacy, including an expanded list and explanations.    Mr. Hirsch and his new &quot;Foundation for Cultural Literacy&quot; are developing tests, based on the list, that he wants all students to take in the third, sixth, ninth and 12th grades. He is barnstorming the nation, telling state and local education authorities that they should use his tests, or come up with their own cultural literacy lists and exams.    This has gained him more than a few demerits in teacherdom. After years of books, reports and commissions dumping on the nation's schools and producing a variety of transitory &quot;reforms,&quot; many teachers are no longer in the mood to be told what to do. &quot;Teachers are standing up all over the country and saying not this time -- we're not going to take this into our pedagogy,&quot; says Mr. Bowman.    Mr. Hirsch and one of his biggest supporters, Chester Finn Jr., the head of research at the Department of Education, got a frosty reception when they pushed Mr. Hirsch's ideas at a big convention of English instructors in Maryland last month. &quot;I'd call the reaction mixed&quot; says Mr. Finn. &quot;Some were nodding their heads, others were exploding in ire.&quot;    Several educators say the list is conservatively biased or slighting to contemporary culture, women and minority groups. Omissions include aviator Amelia Earhart, writer James Baldwin, and virtually anything about rock 'n' roll. Others complain that its well-worn aphorisms, such as &quot;make hay when the sun shines&quot; or &quot;haste makes waste,&quot; won't make anyone more cultured or literate.    &quot;What I object to most is the suggestion that this is a way to raise yourself by the bootstraps and become acceptable,&quot; says Jerry Ward, a black professor of English at Mississippi's Tougaloo College. Although the list carries a &quot;fairly representative number of Afro-American items,&quot; Mr. Ward says, &quot;There's a whole ideology behind {Mr. Hirsch's} definition of culture -- white, Anglo-Saxon, and, above all, arrogant.&quot;    Some are incredulous that anyone can distill a culture into a few thousand items. &quot;The true list would approach infinity,&quot; says Robert Denham, the head of the English programs at the Modern Language Association in New York. For a good reading aid to the newspapers, Mr. Denham suggests an &quot;unabridged dictionary or encyclopedia.&quot;    English teachers, Mr. Hirsch says, have generally &quot;reacted emotionally&quot; to his book and list. Including the list in the book, he says, was a &quot;calculated risk,&quot; which he took because he firmly believes it is possible to define what people must know to be culturally aware.    School administrators in Ohio, Virginia and California, he says, have reacted favorably to his pitch. And he insists he isn't asking them to take on his test or list but only some form of &quot;cultural literacy&quot; standards.    If the critics were to come up with their own list, he would accept it, he says. But to abandon the idea of a basic body of knowledge, he says, would be to conclude that &quot;education is hopeless.&quot;    Besides, Mr. Hirsch is already editing his original list based on comments and letters he has received. &quot;Rather than add a lot of contemporary stuff, my inclination is to drop some of it out,&quot; he says. On his updated list, so far proprietary, he has added Ella Fitzgerald, the Ayatollah Khomeini and Beirut. He has dropped Norman Mailer. What about adding Sinatra?    No, says Mr. Hirsch, &quot;you have to make some predictions about who's going to last.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
