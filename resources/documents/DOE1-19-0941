Magnetic resonanceimaging was performed in 17 patients; 11 results (65%) were positive,3 (18%) were negative, and 3 (18%) were false-positive. Ultrasonographywas performed in 52 patients; 29 (56%) were positive, 16 (31%) were negative,and 7 (13%) were false-positive. Computed tomography was performed on41 patients; 19 (46%) were positive, 16 (39%) were negative, and 6 (15%)were false-positive. Thallium chloride 201-technetium 99m pertechnetatescans were used in 39 patients; 19 (49%) were positive, 11 (28%) werenegative, and 9 (13%) were false-positive. One or more of these noninvasivetests was positive in 78% of the cases. Highly selective venous catheterizationwith measurement of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone concentrationlocalized the abnormal parathyroid gland in 20 of 28 patients (71%) overalland in 8 of the 14 patients (57%) whose tumors were not identified bythe noninvasive techniques. Since false-positive results were common,a combination of localizing studies was helpful in identifying the abnormalgland. Fifty-three of the 59 patients (90%) were successfully treatedat the initial reoperation and three were successfully treated at a secondreoperation. Advances in parathyroid localization have contributed tothe improved surgical results in patients with persistent or recurrenthyperparathyroidism.</TEXT></DOC>
