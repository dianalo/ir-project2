Strikers at Vargashor put down their tools last Wednesday toprotest what they called government failure to make good onpromises of improved economic and social conditions that ended awalkout in July.   Other strike leaders said they would start holding two-hour``pre-emptive'' strikes Wednesday to pressure the government intogranting promised benefits.   About 18,000 miners work in the Vorkuta region, above the ArcticCircle. Workers at the eight other mines also struck on Wednesday,but returned to work 1{ days later.   A regional court ruled Saturday that the strikes violated a lawpassed by the national Supreme Soviet on Oct. 9, but no indicationemerged as to what penalties might be imposed.   Tass said the Vorkuta city strike committee plans to appeal thedecision to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.   It also quoted V. Gobrusev, a spokesman for the regional strikecommittee, as saying his committee ``supported the miners' demandsand the tactics of pressure by pre-emptive strikes offered by theminers' strike committees.''   However, Tass said, the committee did not approve of the fullstrike at Vargashor and said extended walkouts should be avoided.</TEXT></DOC>
