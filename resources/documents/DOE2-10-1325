This researchinvolves a theoretical study of grain boundaries in iron alloys, examiningthe mechanism of cohesion as affected by structure including imperfections,by the average alloy composition and by segregation at the boundaries.This paper summarizes what we have done to date in obtaining approximategrain boundary structures. We have tested the approximate interatomicpotential for iron which we have obtained by using it to compute theinterplanar spacings at the surface and then comparing the computed resultswith experimental observations. Results are discussed. 51 refs., 9 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
