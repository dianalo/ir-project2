These three solid solutions arefound to be in equilibrium with cobalt and all binary compounds of theCo-Bi-Te system. It is demonstrated that the Co-Bi{sub 2}Te{sub 3} sectionis not quasibinary. Cobalt and binary compounds of the Co-Te and Bi-Tesystems are found to be in equilibrium with the delta-solid solution.The difference between the alloys are related to changes in the unit-cellparameters of the solid solution with the alloy composition.</TEXT></DOC>
