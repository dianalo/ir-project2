(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For three decades, NASA has launchedunmanned rockets from this spaceport _ more than 400 of them. OnMonday it plans to fire its last one here, closing an illustriouschapter in American space history.   The fiery finale will be staged by an Atlas-Centaur rocket whichis to blast off at 4:12 a.m. with a military communicationssatellite to link land, sea and air forces around the world with theJoint Chiefs of Staff, the National Command Authority and thepresident.   Once the Atlas-Centaur is gone, NASA's only launch vehicle atCape Canaveral will be the manned space shuttle. When the agency hasa need for an expendable rocket, it will have to buy the launchservices from private industry.   In the past, NASA has purchased unmanned boosters from companiessuch as General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas and used its owncrews to launch them. In the future, crews from private companieswill conduct the countdowns at the Cape as the nation's buddingcommercial launch industry takes off.   The space agency stopped buying Atlas-Centaur, Delta and otherspace boosters early in the 1980s, opting instead to launch all itspayloads from the space shuttle.   Officials admitted that was a mistake after the shuttleChallenger exploded in 1986. Following the explosion, then-PresidentReagan directed NASA to get out of the business of launchingcommercial payloads, opening the way for rocket companies to start anew enterprise.   A backlog of government payloads and a desire to keep spacebusiness from being sent abroad to France, China or even the SovietUnion spurred the policy change.   After the launch of the last Atlas-Centaur, the agency will haveone large unmanned rocket left, a Delta that is to lift a scientificsatellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in November. Andthe government will continue to launch military space rockets fromVandenberg and the Cape.   Still, Monday's launch is a milestone for Cape Canaveral, whereNASA got its start and where it has launched more than 95 percent ofits boosters.   ``It's always sad to see the end of an era,'' said James L.Womack, NASA's director of expendable launch vehicles, who will bein the launch control center Monday.   ``There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we havedone have been fabulous,'' said Joseph Mahon, the agency's assistantadministrator for space flight.   Among the achievements: The Mariner, Viking, Pioneer and Voyagermissions to the planets; 42 weather satellites; the Ranger, Surveyorand Lunar Orbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance ofAmerican astronauts landing there; 94 communications satellites;scores of scientific payloads; dozens of unmanned test launches forthe Mercury, Gemini and Apollo man-in-space projects.   NASA's first launch vehicle was a Thor Able that lifted off Oct.11, 1958, propelling the Pioneer 1 probe toward a flyby of the moon.It failed, as did four more rockets before a Juno 2 hurled Pioneer 3within 37,300 miles of the moon and into orbit around the sun onMarch 3, 1959.   Three more failures followed before the successful launch ofExplorer 6, a radiation-study satellite, on Aug. 7, 1959.   Other failures followed, but the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's overall success rate stands at more than 90 percentof 447 launches.   In recent years the burden has been borne by two workhorserockets, the Atlas-Centaur, which will be making its 68th appearanceon Monday, and the Delta, with 184 liftoffs. Both have a successrate of more than 95 percent.   NASA has ordered launch services starting next year from GeneralDynamics for four Atlas-Centaurs to boost three weather satellitesand a sun-studying payload, and the agency plans to use three Titanrockets launched by Martin Marietta to hoist planetary probes in the1990s.   The change involves no layoffs, since private contractors alreadyfilled many of the ranks of NASA's launch teams and some personnelare being shifted to the shuttle or other space agency programs.</TEXT></DOC>
