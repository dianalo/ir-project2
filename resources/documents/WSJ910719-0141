But the official, who declined to be identified, said thathe believed no agreement has been reached and that Philipsmay be talking to other possible buyers or partners for thebusiness.</LP><TEXT>   Both Philips, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, andDigital, based in Maynard, Mass., refused to comment on aDutch press report that the two are near an agreement on sucha sale.   The information-systems division designs and assemblescomputer systems, mainly for applications in banking,transport, tourism, and government agencies. The divisiondoesn't include production of personal computers; that wasrecently transferred to the company's consumer electronicsdivision. Philips has repeatedly said it is committed tomaking personal computers, despite persistent losses fromthat business.   The company doesn't break out figures for theinformation-systems unit. A Philips spokesman said thedivision produced heavy losses last year, but he declined togive details.   It isn't clear what the business might fetch were it sold.   As part of a corporatewide cost-cutting drive, Philips hasreduced the division's work force by about 20% over the pastyear, to around 8,000 people. The company also has stoppeddeveloping its own minicomputer technology, relying insteadon industry standards.   Some analysts said they would welcome a sale of thedivision, long seen as too small to catch up with strongerrivals. &quot;It's a horribly competitive market, and getting moreso,&quot; said Susan Anthony, an analyst at Robert FlemingSecurities in London. &quot;If they could get out of it, it wouldbe terrific.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
