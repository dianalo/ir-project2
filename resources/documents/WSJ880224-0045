Edward J. Kuriansky, New York's deputy attorney general for Medicaid fraud control, said the company pleaded guilty to one count of grand larceny and 10 counts of falsifying business records. Martin Weissman and Israel Cohen, the company's president and executive vice president, respectively, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy.    The Plainview, N.Y.-based company agreed to make restitution totaling $1 million and to pay a fine of $250,000. The two executives each agreed to pay fines of $100,000, Mr. Kuriansky said.    Sentencing is set for Aug. 3.    Attempts to reach Messrs. Weissman and Cohen and their attorneys were unsuccessful.    A law partner of Mr. Cohen's attorney, however, said Mr. Cohen had been originally indicted on 13 felony counts and the misdemeanor conspiracy count to which he pleaded guilty. In a prepared statement, Professional Care said it agreed to resolve the case.    The company and the executives were among six defendants indicted in 1986 on charges of stealing $1.8 million from the Medicaid program in 1981-1985. They allegedly falsely billed the state for certain services. Two company officials, Edna Lee and Deborah A. Rodriguez, earlier pleaded guilty to some of the charges, said Mr. Kuriansky. He said the case against another, Paula Rothman, is pending.    In a civil suit, Mr. Kuriansky is seeking treble damages of $33.9 million, because of some $11.6 million alleged fraudulent overpayments made to the company statewide. The criminal charges involved only $1.8 million received by the company's Albany, N.Y., office. The civil suit had been stayed until the end of the criminal case, Mr. Kuriansky said.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Professional Care's stock closed at $1.125, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
