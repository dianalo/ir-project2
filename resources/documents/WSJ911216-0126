A &quot;Christmas tree,&quot; as we all know, isthe wonderful term used in the taxwriting game to describe arevenue bill that's festooned with special tax breaks. Inproposing that old chestnut, the investment tax credit, lastweek, the Bush team surely brought cheer to the accountantsand tax lawyers who used to gather 'round the punch bowl.   The sight of the ITC, however, suggests somethingunfortunate. It was said about the Bourbon royalty that theyhad learned nothing and forgotten nothing. Much more economicadvice like this, and Mr. Bush may yet go the way of theBourbons. In refloating this business subsidy, the Busheconomic troika has proved yet again that they didn'tunderstand the Reagan tax cuts and haven't learned muchsince.</LP><TEXT>   The ITC was never part of the Reagan tax proposals. It wasonly included, in the 1981 tax bill, at the request ofDemocrats who wanted political credit of their own for taxcutting. The distorting effect the ITC had on investment isthe main reason it was eliminated in the 1986 tax reform.   The key to the Reagan reforms, both in 1981 and 1986, wasto reduce marginal tax rates so as to keep the tax code frominterfering with the process of economic growth. Bringingback the ITC would return us to the days when the tax codewas massaged, fondled and targeted by congressional centralplanners for what they thought were desirable social andeconomic goals. Back, in short, to the tax-lobby nirvana ofGucci Gulch.   This is precisely why many in Congress are now pushing theITC. They know it would allow them to dish out favors tofavored industries, which will turn around and dish outcampaign contributions to them.   Want some memories? Back before 1986, the investment taxcredit covered livestock (but not horses), movies and TVfilms, timber, storage facilities (but not buildings) forpetroleum products, coin-operated vending machines, and apersonal computer if used at least half the time forbusiness. Remember that &quot;special energy credit&quot; for solar,wind, geothermal and biomass projects? Or for rehabbing oldbuildings? And so on.   Now, it is true that an ITC would lower the cost ofcapital for some industries. Some of the resulting investmentwould even be useful. But unlike a capital-gains cut, whichwould help new industries, an ITC would benefit mainlyexisting businesses. And unlike capital gains, an ITC wouldlose tax revenue, thus raising political pressure for highermarginal tax rates (which may be why Democrats tend to befound hanging around with it).   The problem with this sort of tax policy was explainedlong ago by George M. Humphrey, who was Ike's first TreasurySecretary. Back in 1960 he argued against an ITC with asimple point: The tax system should have only one purpose, toraise revenues. Using the tax code to further political andsocial goals would ultimately be self-defeating. Theintervening years through 1986 proved him out, even ifsucceeding Republican economic advisers have forgotten hispoint.   The Bush troika's new interest in an ITC frankly smacks ofpolitical panic. Having failed to act on the economy for solong, they're now grabbing any life preserver in a recession.It's probably no coincidence that Democrats Mario Cuomo andBill Clinton have both also endorsed an ITC. How else toexplain a dalliance with an idea that even Treasury SecretaryBrady admits is only &quot;somewhat effective&quot;? Quite anendorsement, that.   The U.S. economy is a durable beast, but if it isstaggering, the reason has largely to do with the series ofblows to its underlying confidence. Any list would includeMr. Bush's reversal of his no-new-taxes pledge, the budgetdeal's $165 million tax hike, billions in new state and localtaxes, the dragging anchor of FIRREA's Sandamp;L bailout, and ageneral perception that no one at either end of PennsylvaniaAvenue knows much of anything about what makes an economygrow.   This perception is only reinforced by half-hearted talk ofan ITC, or last week's brainstorm from Bob Dole and DickDarman -- the prospect of two, count 'em two, tax bills nextyear. The Dole-Darman Two Track is just another example ofMr. Bush's men negotiating with themselves rather thanleading. Hearing Mr. Darman, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen noted, &quot;Idon't think the answer is to have two Christmas trees. Theway we can avoid a bidding war is by the exercise ofleadership from the top down.&quot; That sounds about right to us.</TEXT></DOC>
