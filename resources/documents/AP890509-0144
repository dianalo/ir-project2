Bush discussed his desire for a global environmental conference,which would focus on global warming and other issues, during ameeting with Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, said White HousePress Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   That conference would be different than a so-called frameworkconvention that some in the administration are pushing as a way toget an accord in the works. The accord would seek agreement bynations on curbing practices leading to the world's climacticwarming trend.   The environmental conference Bush wants would be more generaland could focus on discussing various issues, said Nancy Maloley,associate director of the Office of Policy Development. She saidthe global warming framework convention has not been ruled out.   However, some presidential advisers, including EnvironmentalProtection Agency Administrator William Reilly, wanted the UnitedStates to make a formal diplomatic overture this week at aninternatinal meeting in Geneva to get the ball rolling on a globalwarming convention.   The idea was dropped by the White House as being prematurebecause the administration has not yet decided its policy on globalwarming, in which emissions from burning of fossil fuels is said tobe increasing the world's temperature.   Developing that position involves taking into account the impacton many sectors of the country, including the agricultural and oilindustries, and the cost to the government of measures to deal withthe problems.   Fitzwater said Bush, who promised during his presidentialcampaign to convene an environmental conference, does not have atime for that conference.   ``His environmental advisers are currently looking at variousformulations for such a meeting and he will discuss it with alliedleaders later in the year,'' Fitzwater said.   Bush ``said the conference would be at the expert level, andwould be designed to utilize the considerable environmental talentin the United States,'' Fitzwater.   Officials say the government is not ready to begin moving towarda controversial convention on global warming because it wouldinvolve so many segments of the administration, in addition to thescientific advisers.   Earlier this week, NASA scientist James E. Hansen complainedthat the Office of Management and Budget had altered hisconclusions on global warming to soften his predictions of direconsequences from the trend. The White House said the changes wereto reflect that not all scientists and analysts within theadministration agree that the results will be so dramatic.</TEXT></DOC>
