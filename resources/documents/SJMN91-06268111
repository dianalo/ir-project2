Tensions are high in the region,where more than 800 people have died since 1988 and many residents have beenforced to flee.;   Fighting was reported in Nagorno-Karabakh the past two daysaround the Armenian village of Chapar, killing six people, the independentnews agency Interfax said.;   A successful resolution of the dispute wouldfurther demonstrate Yeltsin's clout as a national leader after last month'sfailed hard-line Communist coup that led to a power-sharing arrangement withMikhail Gorbachev. The Soviet president failed to settle the conflict overNagorno-Karabakh.;   The agreement calls for Armenia to relinquish claims itmade to the disputed territory in 1989. In return, Azerbaijan, which hasadministered the region for decades, agreed to allow the mostly Armenianresidents of the enclave to choose their own government and run their ownaffairs, Interfax and the state news agency Tass reported.;   Ethnic guerrillaforces would have to be withdrawn by the end of the year, but police andcentral government troops would remain.;   &quot;Our people yearn for a peacefullife,&quot; Tass quoted Azerbaijani President Ayaz Mutalibov as saying after theagreement with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosian.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910924  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  278  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 24, 199100268111,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
