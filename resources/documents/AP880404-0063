The cleric, Ayatollah Mahdi Rouhani, said in Paris on Saturdayhe was unaware of any such demands by Iran, but said he was readyto go if necessary.   Shiite militants loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the22 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans and atleast three Frenchmen.   Ash-Shiraa, the same weekly that disclosed U.S. arms sales toIran in 1986, said Saturday that negotiations between Paris andTehran for the release of French hostages ``have made bigprogress'' and that France likely would deport Rouhani.   In Paris, Rouhani, the leader of Shiites in Europe, said: ``I amready to leave before they ask me. It is my duty as a human being.''   Rouhani, an Iranian, said he has lived in France for the past 25years. He said he opposes Khomeini but supports the IslamicRepublic.   Omran Adham, a French businessman of Syrian descent who hasworked to free French hostages, arrived Saturday in Beirut fromParis, said Beirut airport officials who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The French Embassy in Beirut declined comment and it could notbe determined whether Adham had come to the Lebanese capital toseek the release of hostages.   In London, the Daily Mail, quoting unidentified Frenchintelligence sources, reported today that Iran and France are closeto sealing a deal to release the foreign hostages.   The newspaper said Iran is demanding that France deport Rouhaniand ousted Iranian president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr in return. Itquoted the sources as saying both men agreed to leave France.   The French hostages are diplomats Marcel Carton and MarcelFontaine and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffman. Moslem militantsclaimed in March 1985 that they killed a fourth French hostage,researcher Michel Seurat, but no body has been found.   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
