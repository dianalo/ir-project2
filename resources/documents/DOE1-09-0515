<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-09-0515 </DOCNO><TEXT>A fleet of vehicles is being developed and maintained by Sandia NationalLabs for studies in remote control and autonomous operation. These vehiclesrange from modified commercial vehicles to specially constructed mobileplatforms and are utilized as test beds for developing concepts in theapplication of robotics to interior and exterior physical security. Actuatorscontrol the vehicle speed, brakes, and steering through manual inputfrom a remote driving station or through some level of digital computercontrol. On-board processing may include simple vehicle control functionsor may allow for unmanned, autonomous operation. Communication linksare provided for digital communication between control computers, televisiontransmission for vehicle vision, and voice for local control. With thesevehicles, SNL can develop, test, and evaluate sensors, processing requirements,various methods of actuator implementation, operator controlled feedbackrequirements, and vehicle operations. A description of the major featuresand uses for each of the vehicles in the fleet is provided.</TEXT></DOC>
