TPA, an administrator of health and employee-benefit plans, had been trying to sell First Transcontinental but was unable to find a buyer before the Wisconsin commissioner obtained a court order to liquidate the unit.    As a result of the liquidation proceedings, TPA said another of its units, Management Employer Group Administrators Corp., will begin winding down its operations. All the unit's business had come from a contract with First Transcontinental.    TPA said that the two units contributed $9.5 million of TPA's total revenue of $27.3 million during the first six months of this year. TPA said the units contributed pretax income of $2.2 million in the first half, while TPA's total pretax income was $1.1 million.    TPA said it will now concentrate on the administration of employee-benefit plans. In addition, TPA said it plans to proceed with a proposal to restructure its debt with its exchange offer for $23 million of its 10% convertible subordinated debentures. TPA said it also plans to proceed with the sale of two other units.    TPA shares fell 6.25 cents Friday to close at 31.25 cents each in American Stock Exchange composite trading.    Claims incurred by policyholders of First Transcontinental before Nov. 1 will be paid by the Wisconsin Insurance Security Fund, subject to certain state laws and eligibility requirements, TPA said. </TEXT></DOC>
