The company's refusal to provide information about the policy'senforcement at the union's request also is an unfair labor practice,Administrative Law Judge Wallace Nations ruled last week inWashington.   He said such testing meets legal definitions of issues that mustbe negotiated between employers and unions.   The case has the potential to be precedent-setting nationwidebecause the National Labor Relations Board has not yet ruled on anyappeals involving the issue, said Diane Williams, assistant directorof the NLRB's information division.   If the company does not appeal Nations' ruling by Dec. 1, theNLRB will adopt it routinely, probably in early December, andNations' recommendations will take effect, said Joe Moore, theboard's deputy executive secretary.   If the company does appeal, a panel or the full board willconsider it, he said.   John Dennison, vice president of labor relations for thenewspaper, said Monday that the company was disappointed by theruling but had not decided whether to appeal.   The judge recommended that the company be ordered to revoke itsdrug and alcohol testing policies covering applicants and employeesin jobs covered by its contract with Local 2 of the News Guild ofthe Twin Cities and to negotiate future policies with the guild. Thelocal represents about 350 newsroom and circulation employees of theStar Tribune.   Nations also recommended that the newspaper be required to offera job to any applicant rejected under the policy since it wasimposed on Jan. 1, 1987, and pay the applicant for related losses.He also recommended that the company rescind any punishment thatmight have been imposed on employees under the policy and compensatethem for their losses.   The Star Tribune's policy requires a medical exam, including drugand alcohol screening, for applicants to whom the company offers ajob. If applicants test positive, the company will withdraw the joboffer.   The policy also provides that current employees may be asked toundergo screening when management believes that job performance orconduct is impaired by alcohol or drug abuse.   Dennison said no employee has been tested under the policy sinceit took effect and that he knew of only one job applicant who hadwithdrawn after learning about the policy.   Under Nations' recommendations, the newspaper would be requiredto give the union the names and addresses of people who have appliedfor guild-covered jobs at the paper since the policy took effect andidentify those who refused to take the tests.</TEXT></DOC>
