The nation's largest food wholesaler said it will use the proceeds to pay down debt incurred in its recent $600 million acquisition of Malone andamp; Hyde Inc., another food wholesaler. It said it is selling the units to focus on its main business of delivering food to grocery stores and other retailers.    Fleming said it has tentatively agreed to sell the larger of the two units, White Swan Inc., to members of White Swan's management and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc. unit. White Swan, which distributes food to restaurants and other eateries, has about $500 million in annual revenue.    Fleming said it has an option to own 20% of White Swan after the buy-out. That transaction is expected to close Oct. 1.    In addition, the company has a definitive agreement to sell M andamp; H Drugs Inc., a chain of about 100 drugstores that was owned by Malone andamp; Hyde, to M andamp; H management and Vestar Capital Partners. The purchase is the first for Vestar, a group led by former First Boston Corp. leveraged buy-out specialists that was formed three months ago.    M andamp; H has about $160 million in annual revenue. That transaction is expected to close in early September.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Fleming closed at $30.875, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
