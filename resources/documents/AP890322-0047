(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some officials are worried about a lossin tax revenue, the only restaurant owner in town wonders if heshould add more tables, and an astrologer in a nearby spiritualistcommunity foresees profit.   But all agree that this tiny central Florida village will get ajolt like a lightning bolt from the heavens if evangelists Jim andTammy Bakker move their television ministry here.   ``It could be great for business or turn this town inside out,''said Chamber of Commerce President Jerry Peters. ``Either way, ifthe Bakkers come, this place will not be the same.''   ``I'm not going to put myself in a position of judging a man byhis past deeds,'' said Mayor John Smart, a retired Air Forcechaplain who last week led Bakker on a tour of this area 20 milesnortheast of Orlando. ``What did Jesus say? `He who is without sincast the first stone.' There are some strong feelings in town, nodoubt. But I think we should wait and see.''   Bakker, the former Assemblies of God minister who was stripped ofthe PTL television ministry over his tryst with a church secretaryand questions about finances, visited a 28-acre television studiocomplex here on Friday. It was built in 1982 by Nautilus exerciseequipment creator Arthur Jones and bought in 1986 by Dallas investorTravis Ward.   Evan Keesling, one of four people challenging Smart in an April 4election, believes many of the 2,500 residents are troubled by thesecrecy surrounding the negotiations.   ``I realize that it's a private deal, but many people would haveliked Bakker to come to them first,'' said Keesling, who built thefirst Nautilus machines with Jones in the early 1970s. ``I'd say themood in town is nervous to jumpy.''   Peters and others are concerned about the possible loss of$13,900 a year in property taxes because the ministry is tax-exempt.   Views were mixed in Cassadaga, less than three miles from town,where most residents claim psychic powers and an ability tocommunicate with the dead.   ``I see real estate values going up and money pouring in,'' saidastrologer Hanan Leeds. ``It will be good for everyone, get theidea?''   But Joe Stupar, owner of the 62-year-old Cassadaga Hotel, wondershow the zeal of the Bakkers' fundamentalist followers will mesh withCassadaga mysticism.   ``I'm not so sure how Bakkers' people will relate to this,'' hesaid. ``I'm hoping for harmony, but you never know.''   Bakker said he'd like to relocate the couple's Jim and TammyMinistry from Pineville, N.C., to Lake Helen and construct otherfacilities similar to PTL's Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill,S.C. He said a decision on a new location likely will be made in twomonths.   But Orlando television station WESH reported Tuesday night thatBakker has all but turned down the site because of the $5.5 millionasking price. The station, quoting unnamed sources, said Bakkerplans to look at other central Florida sites.   Bakker and Richard Dortch, his former top deputy, were indictedin December on charges of diverting more than $4 million in PTLmoney for their own benefit and conspiring to defraud theirfollowers. Bakker said he would purchase a new facility withdonations and ``regular bank financing.''   Tom Mead, who owns the only restaurant in Lake Helen, said theBakkers represent the inevitable change assailing rural Florida.   ``Look, Daytona is 25 minutes away, Orlando is 20 minutes. It'sgoing to happen. Why fight it? As long as what Jim and Tammy do islegal, why not welcome them into the community?   ``I'll add a few tables and have them all over for lunch.''</TEXT></DOC>
