WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Red Army troops patrolled the tense Armeniancapital today to enforce a ban on public demonstrations byArmenians locked in a violent territorial dispute with neighboringAzerbaijan.   The Kremlin took a series of decisive steps to quell the ethnicviolence, which has claimed more than 30 lives and posed a seriouschallenge to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Soldiers and helicopters were deployed to Yerevan, the Armeniancapital, to prevent the kind of massive demonstrations staged byArmenians to demand the return of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakhregion that is now part of Azerbaijan.   Demonstrations had been planned for Saturday, but Armenianactivists reported they had been called off.   Armenian activists reported that authorities have ordereddisbanded an Armenian committee that spearheaded the drive to annexNagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.   The government on Thursday announced an eight-year plan to buildmore housing, roads, schools and social services in the disputedregion, where nearly 75 percent of the population of 160,000 isArmenian.   The Kremlin has accused the demonstrators of being extremistsand demanded an end to the Armenian protest actions as``intolerable.'' The demonstrations led to retaliation aganstArmenians in Azerbaijan, where at least 32 people were killed andnearly 200 injured.   Sources in Armenia told The Associated Press by telephone thatthe atmosphere was tense, but they reported no outbreaks ofviolence. Western reporters have not been allowed to visit the area.   Hovik Vassilian, an activist in the protest, said the ArmenianLiterary Gazette newspaper announced today that the committee toannex Nagorno-Karabakh was being disbanded ``because it was workingagainst the people's interests.''   Vassilian said the planned demonstrations Saturday ``won'thappen.'' He said they have been called off ``considering thesituation.''   Armenians, who are predominantly Christian, have been demandingthat the Nagorno-Karabkh region, which is smaller than Delaware, beannexed to the neighboring Armenian republic, though there is nocommon border. Azerbaijan is overwhelmingly Moslem.   The Kremlin plan for Nagorno-Karabkh also assures the localpopulation that television transmission will be upgraded so theycan receive broadcasts in Armenian as well as the national networkand Azeri programming.   Other assurances, such as better supplies of Armenian-languagebooks and preservation of historical and cultural monuments,address issues that incited Armenians to demand annexation for themountainous region, which has been part of Azerbaijan since 1923.   In Azerbaijan, Radio Baku reported today that public assemblies,meetings and street demonstrations will be allowed only by permits,which must be applied for at least 10 days in advance. Thoseviolating the order face criminal penalties, according to thebroadcast monitored in London.   Armenia instituted a similar ban on unsanctioned demonstrationsearlier in the week, according to Radio Yerevan.   It was not immediately clear whether the government plan wouldsucceed in pacifying Armenians worried that Nagorno-Karabakh islosing its ethnic identity. But one official source in Armeniareported a generally quiet, though tense, atmosphere today.   A duty officer at the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs,responsible for police operations, told The Associated Press bytelephone from Yerevan that the city was ``fairly quiet.''   The officer, who declined to give his name or detailedinformation, confirmed Red Army helicopters and security troopswere patrolling the capital to keep order.   Calls to Azerbaijan did not go through today.   Moscow-based dissidents reported Thursday that the atmosphere inArmenia was ``filled with tension.''   On Wednesday, the Soviet government rejected as ``intolerable''the Armenian campaign for annexation, indicating it would not bendto pressure brought on by mass demonstrations and strikes in therepublic last month.   The unrest brought an unusual personal appeal from Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev for calm and reason in dealing with the ethnicdispute. Gorbachev also promised the leadership would reviewArmenia's claims to Nagorno-Karabakh.   Gorbachev's address calmed the demonstrators in Yerevan. But onFeb. 28, ethnic extremists went on a rampage of murder, rape,robbery and other crimes in the Azeri city of Sumgait.</TEXT></DOC>
