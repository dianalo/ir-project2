First of all, to suggest ourwelfare system is generous reflects a seriousmisunderstanding of the benefit levels it provides. The mostgenerous states, and they are currently taking steps toreduce what they offer, provide about $7 a day per person.Most states provide significantly less, food stampsnotwithstanding. Also, over the past decade the buying powerof welfare benefits have eroded about 40% as those benefitsare not adjusted for inflation, as are Social Security andSupplemental Security Income benefits -- and most salaries.   Your statement that policies &quot;may actually encourage&quot;families to choose homelessness begs for substantiation. Thefact that many families end up on the street after stayingwith friends or relatives makes sense. They have used uptheir last line of defense and have nowhere else to turn. Whynot investigate the living conditions of those families thathave doubled- and tripled-up to prevent friends and relativesfrom being homeless? There is a limit and, for whateverreason, that resource becomes exhausted; for increasingnumbers, the street is the only alternative our society hasprovided.</LP><TEXT>   The waiting lists for housing is an indictment of oursociety's failure in a couple of instances -- to see thataffordable housing is present and a wage scale that allowspeople to provide their own shelter. When I read that citiesare paying $3,000 a month for an apartment for the poor, Idon't see a &quot;generous&quot; welfare system. I see a system thatonce more exploits the poor for profit. Why do cities agreeto such outrageous charges?   Your suggestion that 30-year-old policies of urban renewaland gentrification be reviewed is on target. Also, the moveaway from &quot;ghettoizing&quot; the poor by large housing projects isneeded. Single-room-occupancy hotels have limited impact onhomeless families.   But I challenge your conclusion that our social policieshave &quot;artificially&quot; created demand for public housing. Oursocial policies have created a housing disaster and a realdemand for decent, affordable housing.   Gregory R. Versen   Associate Professor of Social Work   James Madison University   Harrisonburg, Va.   ---   You list several reasons for the housing shortage, butomit a major cause. For years Congress and the IRS have beenstriking at rental-property investors by every means, such asever-lengthening depreciation terms, restrictions ondeductions of interest expense and an especially devilishsystem of income classification that divides income into&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot; Rental income is &quot;bad&quot; income, called&quot;passive.&quot; Losses from rental income can be deducted only incertain restricted cases.   Why all this obstruction to investment for badly neededrental property? Behold the workings of the economics ofenvy] Abraham Lincoln said it best: &quot;You cannot help the poorby hurting the rich&quot; (not that most people who own rentalproperty are especially rich).   Affordable rental property will not become plentiful untilthe &quot;Politically Correct&quot; investment obstructions are removedand incentives are restored.
