Salerno was convicted under the criminal side of the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of running aGodfather-style crime family _ the kind of target the RICO law waswritten for 20 years ago.   After Helmsley was found guilty of tax fraud, the hotel queenwas charged in a civil racketeering lawsuit with taking millionsfrom her ailing husband _ the type of case RICO opponents say thelaw wasn't necessarily intended for.   For the third time since 1986, Congress is considering a reformof the civil racketeering law, aimed at stripping provisionsallowing triple damages and exempting the securities andcommodities industries from its scope.   One of the most contentious issues in business and legal circlestoday, the RICO ruckus pits a coalition of big business, labor andsecurities firms against consumer groups, state prosecutors andsecurities regulators.   A Wall Street Journal editorial called civil RICO ``the mostabusive legal invention since the Alien and Sedition Laws.''   Opponents quote cases from a divorce to a dispute over a rabbi.They say the law has been used to bludgeon large settlements fromdefendants, backlogged federal dockets and slandered businesses.   ``You hate to tell your stockholders you're being sued infederal court as a racketeer,'' said Kim R. Pearson, a Washingtonlawyer representing the National Association of Manufacturers in acoalition demanding reform.   Defenders say RICO combats widespread business and securitiesfraud by providing a powerful economic deterrent. They reject theargument it encourages frivolous lawsuits.   ``Silly RICO cases get thrown out by the courts,'' said MichaelWaldman, director of the consumer group Public Citizen's CongressWatch in Washington. ``The issue is money. The issue iswhite-collar crime.''   ``They don't want to pay treble damages in the cases in whichpeople are responsible,'' added Notre Dame law professor G. RobertBlakey, who helped draft the original racketeering statute.   RICO was enacted in 1970 to attack organized crime. The civilside allows plaintiffs who show two racketeering acts in 10 yearsto sue for triple damages plus attorneys fees. Nothing limits itsuse to mobsters.   Criminal RICO has received big publicity partly becauseprosecutors have used it to attack financial crime. Defendants riskminimum 20-year prison terms, $25,000 fines per count andforfeiture of assets before trial.   A jury recently convicted six defendants in the first-ever useof RICO against securities professionals, the Princeton-NewportPartners tax fraud case. Bond financier Michael Milken and dozensof Chicago commodity traders also face racketeering charges.   RICO reformers aren't quibbling with these prosecutions. They'remore concerned about its use in inheritance fights or squabblesbetween competitors, for example.   ``Civil RICO has been badly abused,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher,D-Va., sponsor of the House reform bill.   ``It was designed to provide a remedy for people who werevictimized by organized crime activities,'' he said. ``It has beenused, however, almost exclusively in the context of ordinarybusiness disputes.''   Uncertainty over the law limited the number of civilracketeering suits to about 500 until the Supreme Court in 1985upheld the statute and cases multiplied.   The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts says 1,049 civil RICOlawsuits were filed from July 1, 1988, to last June 30, about asmany as in each of the previous two years. Still, that representsless than one-half of 1 percent of the total of 233,293 civil cases.   Federal statistics show that in the 1987-88 period, the mostrecent available, 132 cases were settled without trial. Since 1985,experts say there have been only about 15 civil racketeering juryverdicts. Judges have dismissed the bulk of cases or ruled withouta jury.   Boucher claims the lure of triple damages ``makes civil RICOirresistible to any plaintiff who can meet the requirements,'' andthat state-court fraud cases wind up in federal court.   ``What that does is leverage very substantial settlements basedon less than substantial allegations from a defendant who fearstreble damages and also doesn't want to be branded a racketeer,''he said.   It's difficult for RICO reformers to identify settlementsreached to avoid a trial or threat of huge awards. Most cases theycited during congressional hearings this year dealt with allegedlyabusive filings that were dismissed.   In one, an Illinois rock concert promoter sued another over useof an arena. Others include a free-lance reporter who sued ABCTelevision for failing to give him credit on a story,landlord-tenant disputes and allegations of fund-raisingirregularities in Walter Mondale's presidential campaign.   Pending civil cases include a $250 million class action suit and$1.1 billion government suit against defunct Lincoln Savings andLoan Association; a $1 billion bond issue fraud suit by theWashington Public Power Supply System against General Electric Co.;and suits charging abortion protesters in Pennsylvania disruptedbusinesses and damaged property.   Large settlements include $25 million paid by Ashland Oil Co. ina case brought by two former executives who claimed they were firedfor protesting alleged bribes to foreign officials, and a $15million settlement by the accounting firm Laventhol andamp; Horwath afterit was convicted of aiding securities law violations by a financialpromoter.   Anti-RICO forces maintain that state laws and regulatoryguidelines already cover abuses and protect defrauded consumers.   ``The securities industry has had this unique case law that hasdeveloped over 50 years that has given these people means ofrecovery,'' said Donald Crawford, senior vice president of theSecurities Industry Association. ``There is no need for RICO.''   Congress Watch's Waldman countered: ``There is a white-collarcrime wave going on in this country. It's hard to imagine how alobbyist for Wall Street can say with a straight face that theexisting laws are working well.''   The reform battle aside, both sides agree the law needs tobetter define racketeering.   ``It's so vague that no one knows until after the fact what theyare required to do to avoid violating the law,'' said New Yorkattorney Jed Rakoff, who represents Eastern Airlines strikers suingmanagement for racketeering.   The Supreme Court earlier this year practically invited achallenge to the law on grounds of vagueness. In a speech, ChiefJustice William Rehnquist criticized abusive filings and called forcongressional action.   ``Most of the civil suits filed under the statute have nothingto do with organized crime,'' he said. ``They are garden-varietycivil fraud cases of the type traditionally litigated in statecourts...   ``I think the time has arrived for Congress to enact amendmentsto civil RICO to limit its scope to the sort of wrongs that areconnected to organized crime, or have some other reason for beingin federal court.''</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for Sunday, Oct. 8</NOTE></DOC>
