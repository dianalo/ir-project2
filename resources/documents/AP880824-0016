Thornburgh says heis concerned that a special prosecutor plan aimed at Congress byhis predecessor, Edwin Meese III, is a ``cure where there is nodisease.''   Thornburgh said in an interview Tuesday that he is taking a``second look'' at an order Meese signed on his last day asattorney general that requires special investigations of members ofCongress suspected of criminal wrongdoing.   ``I want to find out what the underlying premise was in theissuance of the order,'' said Thornburgh.   The former Pennsylvania governor, who was sworn in Aug. 12,arrived in the waning days of the Reagan administration to head adepartment that had been buffeted by Meese's tenure.   Meese was the subject of a lengthy investigation by IndependentCounsel James C. McKay, who declined to seek indictments but saidin his final report that Meese ``probably'' had broken ethics laws.   Meese's final-day order for special prosecutors to investigatemembers of Congress was widely viewed on Capitol Hill as a partingshot by Meese at his critics there.   Thornburgh, 56, a former head of the Justice Department'scriminal division in the Ford administration, said Tuesday that itis ``pretty well known that I see a very limited role for specialprosecutors-independent counsels in the process of investigatingand prosecuting criminal cases.''   He said U.S. attorneys and the department's office of publicintegrity, which investigates corruption of public officials, do afine job pursuing allegations of criminal conduct, and prosecutingif necessary.   Thornburgh established the public integrity office in themid-1970s.   ``I guess what I am curious about is what is being proposed ...a cure where there is no disease'' he said. ``I am taking whatcould be called fairly a second look at that order.''   While Meese was attorney general, a number of high-rankingofficials resigned, and a number expressed unhappiness with theattention Meese was forced to give to McKay's investigation.   Asked how he planned to restore morale, Thornburgh said: ``Youlead by example, and I want to make it clear that my view of thedepartment is one that requires an absolute fidelity to highstandards of professional conduct and integrity in our operations... the values and principles of any organization are transmittedfrom the top.''   Thornburgh said he will talk to an advisory group of U.S.attorneys to see what they think of Meese's last-minute order oninvestigations of members of Congress.   The order requires that attorneys general appoint an independentcounsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing made against asenator or congressman.   Although the Justice Department already could conduct suchinvestigations on its own, Meese said his order was designed toensure that legislators and top executive officials are treatedequitably.   The 1978 Ethics in Government Act allows executive-branchemployees to be investigated by special prosecutors, a provisionthat was designed to eliminate possible conflicts of interest inwhich an administration would be responsible for investigatingitself.   No comparable conflicts exist when the Justice Department _ partof the executive branch _ investigates members of Congress, who arepart of the legislative branch.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of a governmental affairssubcommittee, already had asked Thornburgh to rescind Meese's orderbecause it contained a drafting error and the public never got achance to comment on it.   During the next five months, Thornburgh said he will ``takestock and make sure everything is shipshape'' in the department. Hesaid the department will aggressively pursue the war on drugs andother criminal activity.   Although he is a strong supporter of GOP presidential nomineeGeorge Bush, Thornburgh said he will not campaign for Bush and hasno commitment that he will keep his job if Bush wins in November.   He refused to talk about partisan politics because of thesensitivity of his position.   And he said he had no idea when the department's office ofprofessional responsibility, which looks into the conduct ofJustice employees, will complete its own review of Meese's conductto see if it met ethical standards.   The ethics review began after McKay issued his report lastmonth. McKay concluded in his final report that Meese probablybroke conflict-of-interest and tax laws, but Meese said the report``vindicated'' him.</TEXT></DOC>
