Essex said it retained Waller Capital Corp., a New York broker of cable TV systems, to &quot;solicit bids on a confidential basis.&quot;    Essex shares rose after the announcement and closed yesterday at $20.50, up $3, in national over-the-counter trading.    About 3.9 million shares are outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including stock options and convertible Class B shares. At yesterday's closing price, those shares have an indicated value of about $84 million.    On the basis of subscribers served, the partnerships are nearly as valuable as the public company. Essex serves about 63,000 subscribers, its four partnerships about 62,000.    On going public last December, Essex's Class A shares sold for $8.25 each.    Douglas W. Paul, Essex's general counsel, said the decision to seek buyout bids was prompted by the favorable market prices recently for cable TV systems. He said some debt-free cable companies have sold recently for the equivalent of $1,700 to $2,000 a subscriber.    Essex has about $20 million in bank debt. As previously reported, Essex had a net loss of $1.5 million in 1986 on revenue of $14.7 million. In the 1987 first quarter, the loss was $412,355 on revenue of $3.9 million. Mr. Paul said the losses were in line with expectations for cable TV systems in their early years of operation. </TEXT></DOC>
