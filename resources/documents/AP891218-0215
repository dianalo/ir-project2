(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Months after their daughter Melina waskilled on Pan Am Flight 103, a notebook she carried was returned toPaul and Eleanor Hudson. A quote written in the back by theteen-ager read: ``No one dies unless they're forgotten.''   The Hudsons have spent much of the past year making sure thatMelina and the 269 other people killed when the jumbo jet was blownup over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21 are not forgotten.   The organization they started, Families of Pan Am 103-Lockerbie,takes up a whole room at Hudson's law offices. The room is filledwith evidence of the couple's life this past year: letters topoliticians, transcripts of congressional hearings, news clippings,lists of victims' families, newsletters, a sketch of Melina.   Melina's mother says she spends countless hours at the office.``I'm a teacher by profession, but this is my job. There's a dutyhere,'' she said.   That duty _ to reveal the full story of the Flight 103 bombing _has taken Hudson, a soft-spoken, well-to-do lawyer, to the halls ofCongress, to Europe and to a private session with President Bush.   He still has questions.   Why wasn't the bombing of Flight 103 prevented? Why was hisdaughter, coming home for Christmas after a semester abroad inLondon, allowed to take a plane with a bomb on it?   ``We thought, `What do we do now that she died? Do we pretendthat she just died in a drowning?''' Eleanor Hudson said. ``She wassixteen. She was coming home from Christmas ... What kind of jokeis this?''   She shows a picture of Melina on the front steps of their Albanytownhouse: she is thin, her blonde hair is swept back and she issmiling coyly. ``She was beautiful. How could we not do this?''   Days after the crash, Hudson took Melina's dental records toLockerbie for her identification. The Hudsons' dentist told EleanorHudson, who remained in Albany, that another area family who lost adaughter in the crash, the Hartunians, was unable to getinformation from Scotland.   She spoke to them on Christmas Eve and realized her husbandcould help.   ``They just wanted to know whether their daughter was in a bodybag or in a morgue,'' she said. ``I said, `My husband is there, hecan find out.'''   The Hudsons met more families at nine funerals and at a memorialservice for the 36 Syracuse University students killed on theflight. They, too, were frustrated by the State Department'ssilence after the crash, Hudson said.   ``To see nothing but a cloak of silence _ it gave us not only anangry feeling, but frankly it was very ominous,'' he said.   ``It was clear to me by the end of January that unless there wassome public outcry, and unless people formally organized, that thegovernment was going to do nothing,'' he said.   On Feb. 19, the Families of Pan Am Flight 103-Lockerbie held itsfirst meeting, in Hasbrouk Heights, N.J.   The organization is partially a support group. But Hudson, aschairman, has spearheaded government lobbying asking for aninvestigation of the bombing.   The group is pressing the government to tighten security forinternational flights. Hudson contends that if Pan Am had competentsecurity, the bombing could have been avoided.   ``We've known (Pan Am's) security was a sham for many months,and it still is,'' he said. ``It's geared to public relations, notto effectively stopping bombings.''   He wants a ban on electronic devices used to hide bombs like theone in a radio-cassette player that blew up Flight 103. He saysluggage should be searched by hand and all luggage be matched withpassengers.   He also wants the government to make public all credible threatsmade by terrorists concerning international flights.   Private investigations found the State Department received asmany as four warnings of possible terrorist actions directed atU.S. air carriers last December, one of them apparently directed atFlight 103, Hudson said.   ``They had a lot of intelligence in the case of 103, it's just amatter of what they did with it,'' he said.   After extended pressure from families and congressmen, PresidentBush appointed a seven-member committee in August to investigatethe crash and draft a report.   Hudson said that could be the definitive document explaining thedisaster. It is tentatively due on May 1.   Meanwhile, the Hudsons have gone to Scotland to mark the crimethat has brought them together with dozens of other families. OnThursday evening in Lockerbie, luminares _ candles stuck in bags ofsand _ are to be lit for each of the 270 victims of Pan Am Flight103.   The quiet lawyer and his wife say they refuse to let anyoneforget.   ``I felt, and I feel, that unless something is done about thesethings, we will see hundreds, perhaps thousands of more Americanscoming back in body bags,'' he said.   ``I have three other children. I don't want to see this happenagain.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday AMs, Dec. 20</NOTE></DOC>
