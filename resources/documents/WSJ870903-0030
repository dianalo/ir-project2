Cray announced yesterday that it is canceling its most advanced supercomputer project, an effort to create an exotic computer 100 times faster and more powerful than anything in existence. The project was running out of control. Optimistically slated for completion in the early 1990s, it would take much longer and cost at least twice as much as the $50 million originally budgeted, Cray decided.    The company also said the project's designer, Steve S. Chen, has decided to leave the concern after refusing to rein in his efforts. The departure of Mr. Chen, who is considered one of two superstar designers at Cray -- the other is founder Seymour Cray -- throws the company into the biggest trauma of its charmed 15-year history. Since it began making some of the world's first supercomputers, Cray has set the global standard for speed and sophistication, and industry people even measure computer speed, informally, in units of &quot;Crays.&quot;    In addition to the loss of Mr. Chen, some of Cray's talented scientists and engineers may defect to competitors. Cray plans to lay off more than half of the 180 people involved on the project, known internally as the MP, for multiple processor. Among the people whom Cray will retain are about 40 of Mr. Chen's team working on faster semiconductors.    Moreover, the company will have to adjust to the latest upheaval just when the industry's rapid growth was already forcing huge additions to Cray's work force and major changes in its culture and management style.    Simultaneously, Cray is facing its first real pressure from outside. NEC Corp. of Japan and ETA Systems Inc., a Control Data Corp. unit, are emerging as serious competitors. And, partly because some customers may be waiting for a new model, Cray's sales growth is slowing to a projected 15% this year, and management is imposing stringent financial controls. But the scrapping of the project leaves a gap in the company's future product line.    Mr. Chen and others had been trying to develop supercomputers with scores of processors, systems in which tens or even hundreds of computer processors simultaneously work on the same problem and solve it far faster than can any machine available today. Cray is completing a supercomputer with eight processors, but coordinating the work of many more proved to be a formidable challenge, and outsiders say Cray's decision to scrap its project indicates that such machines are much further in the future than had been believed.    &quot;The project was getting too far out into the ozone layer,&quot; one senior researcher at the company says.    Cray's chairman, John A. Rollwagen, said the decision to scrap the project returned Cray to its roots -- finding innovative uses for old technology rather than pioneering new science. He said the MP project, which had already run through nearly $22 million, might well have cost more than $100 million to complete. Indeed, when Mr. Rollwagen recently asked Mr. Chen to cut back expenditures as part of a companywide belt-tightening, he said the designer refused and pressed for even more money.    &quot;Steve wanted to start with sand and we wanted to start with parts,&quot; Mr. Rollwagen says.    Rick Martin, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Berstein andamp; Co., comments, &quot;In a company the size of Cray, with little bureaucracy and close-knit engineers, you can't afford to have somebody who does it a different way and spends a lot of money.&quot;    The company gave Mr. Chen what Mr. Rollwagen described as &quot;personal non-exclusive licenses to technical developments&quot; that he achieved at Cray, as long as Mr. Chen doesn't work for someone else. &quot;We don't want to get in Steve's way,&quot; Mr. Rollwagen said.    Explaining the cancellation, Mr. Rollwagen added that the project &quot;needs more money and risks than the company characteristically has taken. So, if we're not going to do it right, then we're not going to do it at all.&quot;    Cray said it would take a write-off in the current quarter to cover costs associated with ending the project; Mr. Rollwagen wouldn't say how big the write-off would be but added that he didn't expect it to be significant. Nonetheless, Cray's stock price plummeted after yesterday's announcement. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, it closed at $104.50, down $8.50 on the day.    For Cray, Mr. Chen's departure shatters an unusual internal setup that has enabled the company to chalk up a remarkable track record. Long lacking any real competition, Cray simulated it internally by pitting its own research teams against each other, one led by Mr. Cray, the other by Mr. Chen. (Three other teams work to make its other machines perform faster.)    By leapfrogging each other's technology in no-holds-barred competition, the teams have spawned successive generations of faster machines. But the cost of such breakthroughs was high. At research centers on opposite sides of Chippewa Falls, Wis., Mr. Cray's hometown, the teams toiled in secrecy and isolation for two and three years at a time, their labs off limits to visitors. Fiercely loyal to their leaders, team members give up most fraternizing with other Cray colleagues.    The rivalry was intense between Messrs. Chen and Cray, who met only rarely to exchange technical data. &quot;There's all kinds of electricity running between them,&quot; Mr. Rollwagen said in an interview several months ago. The result was a high-pressure atmosphere: Mr. Cray once fired several of his team's engineers when they couldn't find a simple way to keep a new machine from overheating and blowing itself up. (He later seized on a liquid used in heart surgery.)    Mr. Chen's group displayed equal intensity. &quot;We're going to show them how it's done,&quot; one team member vowed. &quot;Speed is what we're all about.&quot; Indeed, the Chen team had hoped that its MP could make a calculation in the remarkable time of one nanosecond -- the time it takes light to travel about one foot. That is almost 13 times faster than the Cray-1, Cray's original supercomputer.    The Cray culture encouraged ambitious plans such as Mr. Chen's. Once Cray employees conceived new machines, they often fashioned their own tools to build them. The Cray-3, still being built by Mr. Cray's team, has been reduced to Lilliputian dimensions to cut the time needed for electronic impulses to travel within it. The completed supercomputer, the most powerful of its kind, would fit in an octagonal, acrylic-topped cabinet just 32 inches across and 28 inches high -- resembling a sort of space-age game board.    &quot;Our hurdle has been the smallness of everything,&quot; says Donna Whiting, a member of the four-year Cray-3 development project.    Even while working on the MP, members of Mr. Chen's team were already peering deep into the future. They envisioned a $100 million monster computer with 100 or more central processors -- a machine that could run circles around any now in existence.    &quot;There are people in government that are more concerned about having a computer 100, maybe 1,000 times more powerful than anything else in the world,&quot; says George Spix, lead software designer on Mr. Chen's team.    There were early signs that such ambitions were putting a strain on the company, though, and that Mr. Chen's team might have been reaching too far. Melvin &quot;Skip&quot; August, another senior engineer on the Chen team, said a few months ago that if they ever accomplished some things that they were trying to do with the MP, &quot;I'm going to walk over the lake.&quot;    At the same time, booming growth in the supercomputer industry is forcing Cray to expand its work force and is stretching its loose, decentralized organization. Moreover, Cray is facing a classic management challenge. The company is rooted in disdain for big-company bureaucracy; Mr. Cray quit Control Data to start the company because he was annoyed by what one acquaintance calls &quot;14 floors of bureaucracy&quot; at Control Data.    Despite its burgeoning size, Cray remains a crazy-quilt of decentralized units; regional sales and service divisions have their own boards of directors. Resistance to bureaucracy lingers on; one of Cray's few rules is to avoid meetings at all costs.    &quot;We work hard to keep things informal,&quot; says Larry W. Dahl, manager of Cray's Chippewa Falls assembly plant.    But employment soared more than 25% in the past 12 months alone -- to about 4,500 -- and workers are scrambling to keep up with supercomputer demand. Though the company has never run an advertisement, its revenue jumped 57% last year to $597 million, and Cray ranked first among the Fortune 500 companies in converting sales to profit. (Its earnings tend to bounce around, however, because they depend on the timing of a few big sales; after surging 85% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $57.2 million, they dropped 56% in the second period to $19.6 million.)    &quot;The market is expanding like a balloon,&quot; says Peter C. Patton, the chairman of the Consortium for Supercomputer Research, an industry research group.    Some workers already see signs of stress. &quot;The old ways are still working, but they're getting very strained,&quot; says Judith A. Braun, a Cray software manager.    Many employees attracted by Cray's informality and small-company atmosphere complain about a proliferation of meetings and a shuffling of workers from building to building to accommodate growth. After years of nurturing its own supervisors, Cray has begun to hire outside managers in its software division to handle the rapid influx of employees. The company is even bringing in internal-communications specialists.    Some managers fear an erosion of Cray's unusual management style. Andrew Scott, vice chairman and a founder, likens the company's tenets to poles holding up a tent. &quot;They need to be in place to keep this soft, swingy openness. The whole structure will come down if we start messing with those ideas,&quot; he says. Mr. Rollwagen and other top managers worry that the company's rapid expansion will jeopardize its technological lead as well as its oddball culture.    Says Lester T. Davis, executive vice president and one of Cray's founders: &quot;Our chief problem is to retain the spirit that got us to where we are.&quot;    Mr. Davis was assigned the job yesterday of picking up the pieces of the MP project, which now will focus on less exotic successors to current models. The company also replaced the head of the software-development group, which has become increasingly important to the business as the applications for supercomputers multiply.    Partly because of its edge in software, few outsiders believe that Cray's sales will be hurt in the immediate future. Two-thirds of the world's supercomputers are Crays, and Japanese computer makers have so far installed only one machine in this country.    Software also gives Cray an advantage over some small U.S. companies, among them Thinking Machines Corp., of Cambridge, Mass. Thinking Machines and some others are building supercomputers containing thousands of small processors, a form of multiple processing known as &quot;massive parallel processing.&quot; Some experts predict that ultimately such machines will prove to be the fastest, but right now they are crippled by a lack of software and applications.    &quot;All announcements of sophisticated parallel machines are very interesting until you ask what they are going to do with it and where's the software,&quot; says Peter Labe, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert. &quot;The more parallel, the more bearish I am.&quot;    But the Japanese could eventually be strong competitors. Unlike Cray, the Japanese companies -- NEC, Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd. -- are large, diversified concerns. They have already come a long way; five years ago, they weren't even considered threats.    &quot;All three are delivering real machines with high performance,&quot; says Sidney Karin, director of the Supercomputer Center of the University of California at San Diego. &quot;It hurts the U.S., in its attempt to compete world-wide, to characterize them as not being innovative. It's wishful thinking.&quot;    ---              Cray's Supercomputer Lineup                                  Clock         Performance               Year               Speed in      Factor vs. Machine    Introduced  Designer  Nanoseconds*  Cray-1 Cray-1        1976      Cray       12.5           1 Cray X-MP/2   1982      Chen        8.5        1.5-2.5 Cray X-MP/4   1984      Chen        8.5          7-10 Cray-2        1985      Cray        4.1          6-12 Cray Y-MP     1988      Chen        6**          30** Cray-3        1989      Cray        2**         100** MP            ----      Chen        1**          N.A.
