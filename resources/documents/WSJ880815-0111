The Bank Board put up $7.7 million in cash and an $18 million note to assist the merger. Through its Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., it also agreed to cover 80% of the losses for certain Capitol Federal assets and certain legal costs. With offsetting tax advantages, the net cost to the agency is expected to be $16.1 million, the Bank Board said.    The transaction raises to 54 the number of troubled thrifts that the Bank Board has closed or helped to merge this year.    Capitol Federal, which had assets of $242.6 million, had losses since 1979 that pushed its regulatory net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- down to a negative $3.5 million, the Bank Board said. Its two offices will become branches of Standard Federal. Standard Federal already had seven offices and assets of $956.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
