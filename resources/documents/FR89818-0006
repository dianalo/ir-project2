Background and the Proposed Rule </ITAG>The Board, on February 2, 1989, proposed to amend its regulations so thatthey would conform to the classification of assets system that the Board,under the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (``CEBA''), had previouslyadopted. The proposed changes included the removal of references in theregulations to the terms ``scheduled items'' and ``specified assets.''Board Res. No. 89-104, 54 FR 6685 (February 14, 1989) (``proposed rule'').On August 10, 1987, CEBA was signed into law. (Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101Stat. 552). Sections 402 and 407 of CEBA required the Board to establishan asset classification scheme consistent with the classification practicesof the Federal banking agencies and to remove its scheduled items system.Accordingly, the Board, on December 21, 1987, adopted rules establishinga classification of assets system consistent with the asset classificationpractices of the Federal banking agencies, including consistency with generallyaccepted accounting principles, and removed its scheduled items regulation,12 CFR 561.15 (1987). <T3>See </T3>53 FR 338 (January 6, 1988). Although the Board removed andSection;561.15, eighteen other regulations continue either to contain the term``scheduled items'' or to refer to andSection; 561.15. Before adopting the classification of assets system as directed by CEBA,the Board used a measure of an insured institution's ratio of scheduleditems to specified assets to determine whether to approve such institution'sapplication to engage in certain activities. Since CEBA removed the scheduleditems system, the Board proposed to remove andSection; 561.17 and to revisethose regulations that refer to a specified assets ratio, consistent withCEBA and the Board's regulations promulgated pursuant to CEBA. <T3>See </T3>54 FR 6685 (February 14, 1989). The Board proposed to replacethat ratio with a requirement that insured institutions demonstrate compliancewith the minimum capital requirements of andSection; 563.13 and the individualminimum capital requirements of andSection;andSection; 563.14 and 563.14-1.This proposed change would provide supervisory personnel with the flexibilityto restrict an institution's activities on the basis of overall capitalstrength, as determined on a case-by-case basis, rather than on a scheduleditems formula that simply measured problem assets. Moreover, because thereis no longer any reason to compute specified assets, the Board proposedremoving andSection; 561.17 which had defined the term ``specified assets.''12 CFR 561.17 (1988). The Board also proposed technical amendments to andSection;andSection; 563.17-2and 571.1a in an effort to ensure that this regulatory provision and Statementof Policy are consistent with the asset classification system adopted bythe Board. These amendments reflect the Board's conclusions that a properlyconducted appraisal may be an important factor in an examiner's evaluationof an asset, but that the risk of nonpayment is dependent upon severalfactors. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 348, 350. These amendments clarify existing language,not addressed by the final rule adopted in December, 1987, that incorrectlysuggests that an appraisal is required in the evaluation of real estateor real estate collateral for the purpose of establishing valuation allowances.Consistent with the Board's classification of assets system, the proposedrevision to andSection; 563.17-2(a) did not alter the requirement that anappraisal be conducted with respect to real estate owned (``REO'') at theearlier of foreclosure or in-substance foreclosure.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For purposes of the Board's regulations, the terms ``in-substanceforeclosure'' and ``repossession in substance'' have the same meaning.<T3>See </T3>Board Statement of Policy, Accounting for Troubled Debt Restructuring,12 CFR 571.18(h)(1) (1988), for a description of when the Board will deema ``repossession in substance'' to have occurred. The proposed rule also provided that if real estate collateral has beenin-substance foreclosed, the re-evaluation shall be based on the fair valueof the real estate. 12 CFR 563.17-2(b). Finally, the Board proposed a technicalamendment to andSection; 545.112 providing that a Federal institution maycarry REO at fair market value, which may include uncollected interestto the extent the inclusion of such interest is supported by the fair marketvalue of the property.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Comments </ITAG>The Board received a total of three written comments: One from a tradeassociation representing thrift institutions, and two from insured institutions.Their comments were brief and were limited to the following regulatorysections. A. Section 545.112: Real Estate Owned One of the commenters agreed with the proposal to permit Federal institutionsto include uncollected interest in the book value of REO to the extentthat the interest is supported by the fair market value of the property.One commenter objected to the proposal and the other commenter suggestedthat the regulation should permit a Federal institution to account forREO including uncollected interest, at less than fair market or net realizablevalue when appropriate. One of the commenters suggested that the Board clarify its regulation governingthe accounting treatment for REO. This commenter suggested that the accountingtreatment for REO now located in andSection; 545.112, and which is applicableonly to Federal associations, be applied to all insured institutions. TheBoard agrees with this suggestion and is therefore removing andSection; 545.112entirely and including the provision in the Insurance Regulations at andSection;563.17-2(a) to be applicable to all insured institutions. This amendmentcomplies with the CEBA requirement that asset classification practicesbe consistent with the asset classification practices of the Federal bankingagencies. The federal banking agencies' asset classification practicesare generally consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.In order to comply with this CEBA requirement, the Board has determinedto adopt the amendment as proposed, but include it in andSection; 563.17-2(a).The Board notes that institutions are expected, under generally acceptedaccounting principles, to account for REO, including uncollected interest,at fair market or net realizable value. Inasmuch as fair market or netrealizable value should already reflect appropriate disposition and holdingcosts, there does not seem to be any appropriate reason to account forREO at less than fair market or net realizable value. B. Section 563.13: Regulatory Capital Requirement One commenter objected to the continued use of the term ``scheduled itemfactor'' in calculating the contingency component of an institution's regulatorycapital requirement. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.13(b)(4)(i)(F) (1988). This commenter contendedthat such continued use requires an undue calculation burden, deals witha portion of old risks, and is in effect a ``double counting.'' The commenterquestioned how long the Board intends to continue use of the scheduleditem factor. The immediate effect of the Board's removal of the scheduled items regulation,absent some continued recognition of the risks posed by items formerlydeemed scheduled items, would have been to greatly reduce insured institutions'contingency components, thereby reducing the industry's required minimumregulatory capital level even though the quality of the industry's assetportfolio did not change. Thus, in order to counter what would have beenan unreasoned and superficial enhancement of the industry's capital position,the Board found it necessary to implement use of the scheduled item factor.In response to the commenter's objection to the continued use of the scheduleditem factor, the Board does not view the use of the scheduled item factoras an undue or unreasonable calculation burden because institutions havealready calculated their scheduled items as of September 30, 1987. Whilethe Board acknowledges that the factor does deal with a portion of oldrisks, this is offset because the factor does not include existing risksthat were not scheduled items as of September 30, 1987. The Board restatesthat the use of the scheduled item factor is an interim, transitional devicethat is a reasonable measure of asset risk for the industry as a whole,while the Board considers substantial modifications to its minimum regulatorycapital requirements. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 51800 (December 23, 1988). Moreover, there is no ``doublecounting.'' The amount of general valuation allowances that an institutionestablishes for current substandard and doubtful assets that are also includedin the institution's calculation of the scheduled item factor count asregulatory capital. Current assets classified loss, which an institutionhas either charged off or for which it maintains a one hundred percentspecific valuation allowance, may be deleted from the scheduled item factor,as may assets included in the scheduled item factor that have been paid-offor sold without recourse to a nonaffiliate. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.13 (1988); Office of Regulatory Activities (``ORA'')Memorandum andplusmin;R 72 (April 26, 1988). C. Section 563.17-2: Re-evaluation of Assets; Adjustment of Book Value;Adjustment Charges <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 563.17-2(a): Real Estate Owned </ITAG>One commenter interpreted this proposed amendment to provide that an institutionmay adjust the book value of real estate owned only on the basis of periodicre-appraisals. This is an incorrect interpretation of andSection; 563.17-2(a).Paragraph (a) of this section is intended to pertain to appraisals of REOand requires an appraisal at the earlier of in-substance foreclosure oracquisition. The Board notes that the first part of the penultimate sentenceof proposed andSection; 563.17-2(a) mistakenly reads, ``<T3>Re-evaluations </T3>of parcels of real estate * * *'' (emphasis added).In this final rule, the Board has corrected the phrase to read, ``<T3>Appraisals </T3>of parcels of real estate * * *'' (emphasis added).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 563.17-2(b): Re-evaluation of Loans and Other Assets</ITAG>Section 563.17-2(b) is intended to address re-evaluations of REO. Pursuantto generally accepted accounting principles, paragraph (b) provides thatre-evaluations of real estate or real estate collateral shall be basedon net realizable value. A commenter questioned why the Board proposed to transfer to this sectionthe availability of private mortgage insurance as a consideration in classifyingassets. As described in the proposed rule, the Board believes that theavailability of private mortgage insurance compensation is a re-evaluationfactor rather than a classification of assets factor. The commenter alsoargued that the inclusion in this section of the private mortgage insuranceprovision indicates that such consideration is only available to examinersand not to institutions. The Board would like to emphasize that the inclusionof private mortgage insurance in this section indicates that considerationof private mortgage insurance compensation is not limited only to examiners.Rather, authority for the treatment of private mortgage insurance is prescribedby generally accepted accounting principles, which state that insured institutionsare authorized to consider the availability of private mortgage insurancecompensation when re-evaluating loans and other assets, including REO.Finally, this same commenter suggested that the proposed section that addressesprivate mortgage insurance be clarified to presume the probability of paymentunless there is a substantial reason to believe that a denial of a claimwill occur. The Board believes that some clarification of this sectionis warranted, but disagrees with the suggestion by this commenter. Thisfinal rule amends the provision regarding private mortgage insurance tostate that a re-evaluation of loans or other assets should take into considerationthe availability of compensation by private mortgage insurance to the extentof its probability of payment. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 563.17-2(d): Adjustment Charges </ITAG>One commenter questioned why the Board proposed to modify the current requirementthat an adjustment charge may be made against either earnings or reserves,by requiring that adjustment charges shall be made first against allowances,and then against earnings. The commenter believes that such a change unnecessarilyremoves an institution's discretion in accounting for adjustment charges,including such matters as timing and consolidation of entries. The Board is revising this paragraph to be consistent with generally acceptedaccounting principles. Also, the Board does not view the changes as imposingany substantive requirements more exacting than the regulation previouslycontained. Requiring that adjustment charges be made first against an allowanceand then against earnings has the same result as if the accounting entrieswere made in reverse. Moreover, paragraph (d) does not specify any requirementswith respect to the consolidation or timing of entries. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Section 571.13: Participation Interests in Pools of Loans </ITAG>One commenter recommended that the Board clarify the meanings of the term``pool of loans'' and the phrases ``maximum regulatory limitations, or30 years'' and ``maximum regulatory limitations, or 90 percent of the securityvalue'' contained in paragraph (a)(3). <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 571.13(a)(3) (1988). The Board agrees, and is amendingthe first sentence of the regulation to clarify that a pool of loans meansa group of loans in the nature of mortgage-backed securities. The Boardis also amending paragraph (a)(3) to clarify that the 30 year limitationapplies when there is no otherwise applicable maximum regulatory limitation.Furthermore, the final rule clarifies that 90 percent of the security valueapplies when there is no regulatory maximum percentage of value limitation.The same commenter also suggested that insured and guaranteed loans andloans with private mortgage insurance coverage be excluded from the originator/servicerreporting requirements of paragraph (a)(3). The Board agrees that insuredand guaranteed loans should be excluded from these reporting requirements.Former andSection; 571.13(a)(3), however, did not exclude loans with privatemortgage insurance coverage. The Board believes that an amendment to excludeloans with private mortgage insurance from the originator/servicer reportingrequirements would constitute a substantive amendment and is not appropriateat this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Final Rule </ITAG>In addition to the changes from the proposed rule described in the ``Discussionof Comments,'' the final rule differs from the proposal in the followingareas. To be consistent with the Board's classification of assets system, andSection;563.17-2(a)is amended to direct that an institution's appraisal of REO shall be conductedat the earlier of in-substance foreclosure or at the time of acquisition.Section 563.17-2(b) of this final rule provides that an examiner shallbase re-evaluations of real estate and real estate collateral on net realizablevalue. This is in contrast to paragraph (b) as proposed, which providedthat if real estate collateral has been in-substance foreclosed the re-evaluationshall be based on fair value. As a result of the issuance of ConsensusNo. 89-9 by the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial AccountingStandards Board, clarifying that in-substance foreclosures and actual foreclosuresshould be accounted for in the same way, the Board is not including this``fair value'' prescription in the final rule. Paragraph (b) of the finalrule also provides that the availability of private mortgage insurancecompensation may be a re-evaluation factor, rather than a classificationof assets factor, which the Board is removing from Section 571.1a. Paragraph(d) provides that adjustment charges shall be made against establishedallowances, if any, and then against earnings. Also, as a technical amendmentthe Board is removing language in Section 571.1a that incorrectly suggestedthat an appraisal must be used as a basis for establishing a valuationallowance. As previously described, the Board proposed a technical amendment to andSection;545.112 providing that a Federal institution may carry REO at fair marketvalue, which may include uncollected interest to the extent the inclusionof such interest is supported by the fair market value of the property.The Board has determined, however, to apply this provision to all insuredinstitutions. Therefore, it has been included in andSection; 563.17-2(a).Accordingly, the Board is removing andSection; 545.112 entirely. An exception to the proposed removal of regulatory references to ``scheduleditems'' is the continued use of that term, and the use of a ``scheduleditem factor'' in andSection; 563.13(b)(4)(i)(F). <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.13(b)(4)(i)(F) (1988). In adopting the classificationof assets system, the Board developed and implemented the use of the scheduleditem factor as an interim, transitional measure to calculate the contingencycomponent of an institution's regulatory capital requirement. <T3>Id.</T3> The Board will continue to include the scheduled item factoras an interim device until the Board completes its review and considerationof appropriate revisions to the minimum regulatory capital regulation.<T3>See</T3> 53 FR 338, 345. The Board wishes to note that it is continuing to review the proposed changesto the minimum regulatory capital requirement regulation. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.13 (1988); 53 FR 51800 (December 23, 1988). TheBoard's proposed capital requirement is a risk-based system and does notuse a scheduled items factor. This regulation, effective immediately upon adoption by the Board, is beingissued without the delayed effective date requirements of the AdministrativeProcedure Act, as amended (``APA''). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2), andin accordance with the Board's regulations published at 12 CFR 508.14,the Board has determined that the regulation is not subject to the delayedeffective date requirements of the APA because the regulations are conformingand technical amendments that impose no new requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis: 1. <T3>Reasons, objectives, and legal basis underlying the rule.</T3> Theseelements are incorporated above in the Supplementary Information section.2. <T3>Small institutions to which the rule would apply.</T3> The rule wouldapply to all insured institutions without regard to size.3. <T3>Impact of the rule on small institutions. </T3>The rule would not havea disproportionate impact on small insured institutions. 4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. </T3>There are no known federalrules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule. 5. <T3>Alternatives to the rule. </T3>The Board has not found any alternativesto date that would be less burdensome and adequately address its concerns.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>12 CFR Part 545 Accounting, Consumer protection, Credit, Electronic funds transfers, Investments,Manufactured homes, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Parts 546 and 561 Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Part 563 Bank deposit insurance, Currency, Investments, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Part 563b Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings and loan associations,Securities. 12 CFR Part 563c Accounting, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings and Loanassociations, Securities. 12 CFR Part 570 Bank deposit insurance, Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Part 571 Accounting, Bank deposit insurance, Savings and loan associations.Accordingly, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board hereby amends parts 545 and546, subchapter C, and parts 561, 563, 563c, 570, and 571, subchapter D,chapter V, title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER C_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN SYSTEM </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 545_OPERATIONS </ITAG>1.
