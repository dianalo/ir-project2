Its purpose was to provide cost recoveryfor engineering review and administrative processing associated with theissuance of conditional Letters of Map Amendment (LOMAs) and conditionalLetters of Map Revision (LOMRs) for proposed floodplain modification projects.The fee structure for the issuance of these conditional LOMAs and LOMRswas based upon the then prevailing private sector labor rate of $25.00per hour.Based on a cost analysis conducted during February of 1988, andSection;andSection;72.3 and 72.4 are revised to reflect the currently prevailing private sectorlabor rate of $30.00 per hour. An additional fee category, Structural measureson alluvial fans, has been added under andSection; 72.3, along with a correspondingfee. Alluvial fans are defined as geomorphic features characterized bya cone or fanshaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments thathave been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, andthen deposited on the valley floors, and are subject to flash flooding,high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition,and channel migration. The number of hours allotted for the review of proposedstructures on alluvial fans is 40, and the corresponding fee, at $30.00per hour, is $1,200.00. Section 72.4 is also revised to specify paymentof both the initial fee and the final cost to the National Flood InsuranceProgram as opposed to the United States Treasury. This change is necessarybecause the source of funding utilized to provide these services has beenchanged by Congress from appropriations from General Revenues to transfersfrom the National Flood Insurance Fund.On December 30, 1988, FEMA published a notice of proposed rulemaking designedto notify interested parties of FEMA's intent to implement these rule changes.The final rule published today is essentially the same as the proposedrule.In the summary of the proposed rule, FEMA invited the public to submitcomments during the 30-day comment period which closed on January 30, 1989.No comments were received during the 30-day comment period.FEMA has determined, based upon an Environmental Assessment, that thisrule will not have significant impact upon the quality of the human environment.As a result, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared. Afinding of no significant impact is included in the formal docket fileand is available for public inspection and copying at the Rules DocketClerk, Office of General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency,500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and, hence, has not undergone regulatory flexibilityanalysis.This rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined in Executive Order 12291,dated February 27, 1981, and, hence, no regulatory analysis has been prepared.FEMA has determined that this rule does not contain a collection of informationas described in section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 72 </ITAG>Flood insurance, Flood plains.Accordingly, 44 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter B, is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 72_PROCEDURE AND FEES FOR OBTAINING CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF MAPCHANGES </ITAG>The authority citation for Part 72 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.; Reorganization Plan No. 3of 1978; E.O. 12127. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;72.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended] </ITAG>1.
