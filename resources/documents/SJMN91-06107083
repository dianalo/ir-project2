Graduates wouldreceive up to $2,470, enough for University of California fees for one year,for instance.;    Coto's plan is a variation of industrialist Eugene Lang's &quot;Ihave a dream&quot; tuition guarantees for disadvantaged students. The beauty ofthese guarantees can't be measured in dollars. By setting high goals andgetting parents and educators more involved, spectacular academic successoccurs where it's least expected.;    Just as Lang had his skeptics, Coto hashis.

High-tech innovators andentrepreneurs as well as bankers, manufacturers, and service providers in thisvalley understand the business and social value in having a well-educatedcommunity.;    With the Community Foundation of Santa Clara County managingthe endowment and Junior Achievement raising funds, this is a safe investmentwith high, long-term returns.;  FOLLOW-UP . . .
