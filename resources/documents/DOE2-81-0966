<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-81-0966 </DOCNO><TEXT>Zirconium(IV) has been extracted as its ferron complex with tribenzylaminein chloroform and determined spectrophotometrically by measuring theabsorbance of the complex at 400 nm. Beer's Law is obeyed over the range0.2-7 {mu}g Zr/ml with a sensitivity of 0.006 {mu}g Zr/cm/sup 2/. Themethod is free from interference of large amounts of manganese(II), iron(III),cobalt(II), nickel(II), zinc(II), aluminium(III), uranium(VI), thorium(IV),silver(I), mercury(II), and lead(II). The tolerance limit for tungsten(VI).titanium(IV), copper(II), tin(II), chromium(VI), vanadium(V) and molybdenum(VI)is comparatively low. (author). 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
