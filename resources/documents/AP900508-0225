ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>FINDLAY, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Carl Icahn virtually conceded defeat in hislatest battle with USX Corp., but he remains convinced he willultimately win his crusade to boost the price of the steel-energyconglomerate's stock.   Icahn told shareholders at the USX annual meeting Monday hemight not have the crucial support of several big institutionalinvestors. He said his plan to break up USX and spin off its U.S.Steel subsidiary apparently would fail.   But the takeover strategist, who is USX's largest stockholderwith a 13.3 percent stake, told reporters he found ``a strongnucleus of shareholders'' who believe management should do more toimprove the company's stock price.   Icahn said he would keep talking to these shareholders, and hepredicted, ``I think there will definitely be some changes.''   ``I think we made a statement,'' Icahn said of his non-bindingproposal, which would have separated the lackluster U.S. Steel fromthe more robust Marathon Oil Co.   Icahn may have been undaunted because he knows how to win thisgame _ he's done it before.   In 1988, Icahn lost a fight to unseat Texaco Inc.'s board ofdirectors at the oil giant's 1988 annual meeting. But severalmonths later, Texaco management decided to undertake arestructuring _ including the sales of billions of dollars worth ofassets _ that Icahn had campaigned for as a means of boosting sharevalues.   ``We were right at Texaco,'' Icahn told reporters Monday.   ``We'll stick around to see that (stock) value appreciate,'' hesaid of USX.   Icahn made a hostile takeover bid for USX in the mid-1980s, buthe said another buyout offer is unlikely because the company's``poison pill'' defense limits the number of shares he could buy.   Before the meeting, observers said Icahn eventually could forcemanagement to restructure aggressively even if his proposal failed.The company has said it will continue its 10-year-oldrestructuring, but management wants to accomplish it on its ownterms.   There was no surge of support for Icahn apparent at Monday'sgathering. He received polite applause for his comments, butshareholders who spoke in favor of management and against breakingup the company got a slightly more enthusiastic response.   The 3{-hour meeting was attended by some 600 shareholders, mostof them individual stockholders and retirees of USX subsidiaries.   The meeting largely was uneventful _ the company's biggestshareholders, the institutional investors, did not speak, and manyalready had submitted their proxies. Results of the vote were notexpected for at least a week.   Icahn got the most support from the crowd when he complainedabout the USX stock price, which he contended would improve if hisplan were carried out and shareholders were issued separate stockfor U.S. Steel and for Marathon.   The outcome of Monday's vote was being watched as an indicatorof how much strength takeover strategists have in the 1990s, nowthat the debt-financed takeover boom has ended.   In March, takeover strategist Harold Simmons lost a proxy fightthat sought to remove the board of directors at Lockheed Corp. Thebiggest winners in that battle were institutional investors whoextracted concessions from Lockheed management.</TEXT></DOC>
