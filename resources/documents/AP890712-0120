Hills said the Bush administration wants other nations to convertnon-tariff import barriers, such as quotas and restrictive licenses,to tariffs.   ``By converting to tariffs, barriers would be more transparentand uniform, making it easier to negotiate worldwide reductions inagriculture support and protection,'' she said in a statement.   The proposal was made in Geneva in trade negotiations with 100other nations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT), which regulates world trade treaties and settlescommerce disputes. The current series of talks, known as the UruguayRound, began in 1986 and are scheduled to run through next year.   In April, GATT negotiators achieved a breakthrough in the talks,which had been deadlocked since December, reaching broad agreementin four key areas, including a compromise on a U.S. demand to doaway with all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. The talkssince then have been aimed at nailing down specifics of how toachieve the goals of the larger compromise.   Hills said the U.S. ``tarification'' proposal must be part of amore comprehensive package including fundamental refors in domesticfarm subsidies, export subsidies and sanitary rules.</TEXT></DOC>
