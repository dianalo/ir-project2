The bank-holding company said it expects to report earnings for the third quarter &quot;in the range of 42 cents to 44 cents a share,&quot; compared with year-earlier net income of $4.9 million, or 56 cents a share.    For the year, Summcorp said it expects earnings of $2 to $2.06 a share, compared with $19.3 million, or $2.20 a share, in 1988.    The company said the provision, which will equal $2.9 million, or 33 cents a share, after taxes, will be in addition to its normal quarterly loan-loss provision of $1,950,000.    Summcorp said the increase in reserves was caused by the rapid deterioration of two loans in its Fort Wayne bank. </TEXT></DOC>
