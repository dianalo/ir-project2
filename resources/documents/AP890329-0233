February's decline in the department's Index of Leading EconomicIndicators was the first drop since a similar dip last Septemberand the largest since a 0.8 percent drop last July.   It was in line with widespread expectations that the economywill slow this year.   The leading index, designed to foretell economic activity six tonine months into the future, had advanced 0.6 percent in Decemberand 0.7 percent in January after vacillating during much of 1988.   With labor markets tight and factories operating close to peakcapacity, analysts say some slowdown is needed to keep the economyfrom overheating and inflation from spiraling.   However, analysts are divided over whether the Federal ReserveBoard can successfully engineer a controlled slowdown thatrestrains economic growth just enough to ease inflation withoutcausing a recession.   The Fed for a year has been pushing up interest rates in orderto relieve inflationary pressures, and it intensified those effortsafter sharp price increases were recorded in January and February.   At the White House, presidential press secretary MarlinFitzwater pointed to the index's increase at an annual average rateof 1.5 percent since August 1988 and 3.5 percent since February1988.   ``The trend is still upward and one month's figures don'tprovide a real basis for judging any change in that trend,'' hesaid.   In another report today showing the impact of higher interestrates, the government reported that sales of new, single-familyhomes plunged 9.4 percent in February to the lowest level in morethan a year.   The Commerce Department said sales retreated to a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 626,000 in February, following a 2.5percent increase in January and a 3.7 percent gain in December.   Fitzwater also sought to minimize the housing statistics,saying, ``Monthly housing sales vary substantially.''   He said the figures also reflected higher interest rates and``probably some slowing in the economy.''   Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover TrustCo. in New York, said in advance of today's report that the jaggedbehavior of the leading index suggests ``the economy has beenslowing down from its overheated pace and that the economy iscontinuing to slow down as we work our way into the second quarterof 1989.''   Kellner said that despite the Federal Reserve's efforts toprolong the life of the economic expansion even as it restrainsgrowth, ``the odds are growing each day'' that the central bankwill push the nation into a recession.   In February, eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leadingindex declined, with the biggest negative factor being a drop inmanufacturer orders for new plants and equipment.   The other negative factors were a drop in building permits, adecline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a contractionin the money supply, a dip in an index of consumer expectations, anincrease in initial claims for unemployment benefits, faster vendordeliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline inmanufacturers' unfilled orders.   Two indicators made positive contributions: an increase inprices for raw materials indicating stronger demand, and risingstock prices.   One indicator was unchanged last month: the length of theaverage work week.   The various changes left the index at 145.2 percent of its 1982base of 100. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen 3.5percent, after climbing 2.4 percent over the previous 12-monthperiod.   The economy began the new year with strong momentum, but anumber of government reports on its performance in February pointeddownward, including drops in retail sales, housing construction,orders for durable goods, manufacturing employment and factoryoperating rates.   Economist David Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua,N.Y., said that with evidence of an economic slowdown likely tomount, the Fed probably will ease its grip on the money supply bymid-year.   ``The probability is very good that we will avoid a recession,''Levy said.   The traditional signal of an oncoming recession is threestraight declines in the leading index. The components of thecomposite index were revised last month to improve its forecastingabilities, but when the new index is applied retroactively, itflashes two false recession signals since the 1981-82 economicdownturn.   The economy grew a robust 3.9 percent in 1988, the best showingin four years, but most private analysts expect the gross nationalproduct to expand only by about 2.7 percent this year, slowed byhigher interest rates and a worsening of the trade deficit.   President Bush is counting on a 3.2 percent GNP gain to allowthe administration to reduce the federal budget deficit withoutraising taxes, but few economists believe the administration's GNPforecast is realistic.</TEXT></DOC>
