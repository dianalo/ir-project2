A spokeswoman quoted Mr. Walsh as saying that &quot;it would be a reasonable speculation that at some point&quot; he and his team of prosecutors would ask Mr. Reagan to explain his role in the affair. But Mr. Walsh, according to his staff, wants to fine-tune the procedure and the subjects involved in such questions to find the &quot;least inconvenient way&quot; and to make sure &quot;they don't waste the president's time.&quot;    Mr. Walsh first made his comments in an interview with United Press International, and aides later elaborated on them. Although sources close to the investigation have suggested in recent weeks that Mr. Walsh wanted to question the president, yesterday's comments were the first direct statement by Mr. Walsh on the subject.    The White House has suggested that Mr. Reagan might agree to an interview as part of his administration's overall pledge to cooperate with the Iran-Contra investigation.    Law enforcement officials and other individuals familiar with the investigation say Mr. Walsh believes Mr. Reagan's responses would be important in countering arguments expected to be raised by former White House aides John Poindexter and Oliver North, retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord and other targets of the investigation.    Yesterday, an attorney for Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim, who helped run the secret arms network, identified his client as a target of Mr. Walsh's investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
