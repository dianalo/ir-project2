SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The estimated cost of next year's nationalcensus was challenged as too low and the census' likely effect onCongress was criticized as unfair Thursday in testimony before aSenate subcommittee.   Census Bureau estimates of a $2.6 billion pricetag for thenational head count were questioned as probably too low by theOffice of Management and Budget.   And a University of Maryland scholar asserted that the methodused to reapportion the House of Representatives once census countsare finished is unfair to the larger states.   Peyton Young, a professor of public policy, said in testimonypresented to the Subcommittee on Governmental Information andRegulation that he is not sure the current apportionment methodmeets the ``one person one vote'' standard.   Following each census the seats in the House are redistributedamong the states using a complex formula, adopted in 1941, known asthe ``Method of Equal Proportions.''   Several other methods have been used in the nation's history,each with some problem or other.   At the heart of the dispute is the fact that the House haslimited itself to 435 members. Each state gets one and theremaining 385 are then divided according to population. That's whenthe trouble starts.   Because congressional districts cannot cross state lines, nomatter what number of people constitute an average district, theyare never divided equally into every state population. Theleftovers cause the problems and have led to long political fights.   According to Young's calculations, the current system givesstates with fewer people about a 3 percent advantage over largerstates, a difference he considers unfair.   Meanwhile, government officials disagreed before thesubcommittee about the cost of collecting the data to divide upthose seats.   C. Louis Kincannon, deputy director of the Census Bureau, saidthe agency plans to spend $2.6 billion and can conduct a ``highquality'' census on that amount of money.   Gene L. Dodaro of the Office of Management and Budget, however,said the bureau has not planned for all contingencies. Dodaroestimated that the 1990 count will cost as much as $3 billionbefore it is completed.   Dodaro also urged Census officials to begin work immediately onplanning for a census in the year 2000, so they can use lessonslearned in 1990 to make that subsequent count easier and moreaccurate.</TEXT></DOC>
