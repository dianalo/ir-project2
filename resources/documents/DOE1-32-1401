However, recent developments in resistive magnettechnology have improved the field strength, as well as its uniformityand stability. The aim of this paper is to report the preliminary resultsof a new resistive magnet based on a iron core technology with transversefield orientation, operating at 0.38 T. The clinical experience basedon about 200 studies of the brain, spinal cord, cervical, thoracic, lumbo-sacralspine, heart, abdomen and joints was promising in most clinical applicationswith results comparable to those superconductive magnets with a similarfield strength.</TEXT></DOC>
