A family feud would be a better description, as the U.S., France and Britain try to stifle West German yearnings for cuts in short-range nuclear weapons based in Europe. They want Bonn to continue supporting NATO's negotiating priorities -- deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons, reductions in conventional arms to offset Soviet superiority, and elimination of chemical weapons.    While the meeting is the first formal assembly of NATO leaders since 1982, expectations are modest. That's because it is the last NATO summit for President Reagan. As a result, most European leaders are reluctant to make major defense decisions without knowing whether a new U.S. administration will want to alter them.    Specifically, the U.S. and other NATO countries hope to agree on a new conventional-arms-reduction proposal that would at long last enable the West to seize the initiative from Mikhail Gorbachev, whose spate of arms-control proposals in the past year has given him a propaganda advantage in Western Europe. There have been rumors for months that the Soviet leader will propose withdrawal of a large number of Soviet tank forces from Central Europe in exchange for removal of tanks and nuclear-weapons-carrying systems, such as artillery and aircraft, by NATO.    But here again, some European leaders are nervous about setting a policy that the next American administration might change, thereby creating domestic political difficulties for them.    The very presence of French President Francois Mitterrand, along with Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, indicates the intensity of France's reawakened interest in Pan-European defense matters. Paris, which usually prides itself on its independence, hasn't sent a head of state to a NATO summit since it withdrew from the alliance's military structure in 1966.    The main topic of conversation will be President Reagan's planned summer summit with Mr. Gorbachev. As the superpowers strive to reach an accord on slashing their strategic arsenals, NATO leaders are determined to display anew the resolve that helped produce the superpower treaty abolishing intermediate-range nuclear weapons.    For that, though, they need West German acquiesence to the priorities NATO has set to seek treaties covering chemical and conventional weapons before resuming talks on further nuclear disarmament in Europe, specifically what to do with the remaining short-range nuclear weapons based largely in West Germany. The storage sites of thousands of nuclear artillery shells, bombs and missiles with a range of as much as 300 miles dot the landscape along the border between West Germany and its Warsaw Pact neighbors. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to press for a change in the alliance's agenda that would call for prompt negotiations to reduce their number.    Mr. Kohl worries that his political opponents, who argue that the two Germanys would be singled out for destruction in a nuclear war, will push through legislation calling for the removal of all remaining nuclear weapons from West German soil. Such a step would divide NATO by making the conventional forces of the U.S., Britain and France stationed in Germany more vulnerable to superior Warsaw Pact conventional forces.    American officials are hopeful that Mr. Kohl won't mount a serious effort to change the West's negotiating priorities. And they are confident that if he does, the attempt will be deflected by the other allies. &quot;I think there is a fair understanding&quot; among the majority of NATO members that the alliance will stick to its declared stance, says a U.S. official.    Andre Giraud, France's defense minister, says conducting arms-control negotiations is like trying to rearrange a house of cards. &quot;The top cards are those of conventional and chemical arms, followed by those of strategic nuclear arms,&quot; he says. &quot;The bottom cards, those which hold up the others, are those of pre-strategic (shorter range) nuclear arms. The day it comes to general disarmament, nuclear weapons should be the last to go, and it is from Europe that they should go last.&quot;    While Germany also wants the quick signing of a treaty banning chemical weapons, the problem of verification appears to rule out quick movement there or in conventional weapons.    Strategic-weapons talks are likely to absorb most of the Reagan administration's remaining time. &quot;Try to do any more than that and you'll overload the system,&quot; says one official. White House aides say the administration may be able to do little more than set a framework for a verifiable strategic-arms treaty, leaving to the next president the job of signing it and selling it to the Senate. </TEXT></DOC>
