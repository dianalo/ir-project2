Background </ITAG>A. Authority On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulationsimplementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published an amended list of hazardouswastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amendedseveral times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. These wastesare listed as hazardous because they typically and frequently exhibit oneor more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in SubpartC of Part 261 (<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and extraction procedure(EP) toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2) or (a)(3). Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials,industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste that is describedin these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individualfacility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, 40CFR 260.20 and 260.22 provide an exclusion procedure, allowing personsto demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facilityshould not be regulated as a hazardous waste. To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generatedat their facilities do not meet any of the criteria for which the wasteswere listed. See 40 CFR 260.22(a) and the background documents for thelisted wastes. In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including additionalconstituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if thereis a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could causethe waste to be hazardous.Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstrate that the waste does notexhibit any of the hazardous characteristics (<T3>i.e.,</T3> ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and EP toxicity),and must present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whetherthe waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See 40 CFR260.22(a), 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and the background documents for the listedwastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or notthey exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste, generatorsremain obligated to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardousbased on the hazardous waste characteristics. In addition to wastes listed as hazardous in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32,residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastesand mixtures containing hazardous wastes also are eligible for exclusionand remain hazardous wastes until excluded. See 40 CFR 261.3 (c) and (d)(2).The substantive standard for ``delisting'' a treatment residue or a mixtureis the same as previously described for listed wastes. B. Approach Used To Evaluate This Petition In making a delisting determination, the Agency evaluates each petitionedwaste against the listing criteria and factors cited in 40 CFR 261.11 (a)(2)and (a)(3). If the Agency believes that the waste remains hazardous basedon the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA will proposeto deny the petition. If, however, the Agency agrees with the petitionerthat the waste is non-hazardous with respect to the original listing criteria,EPA then will evaluate the waste with respect to other factors or criteria,if there is a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factorscould cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considers whether thewaste is acutely toxic, and considers the toxicity of the constituents,the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their tendency to migrateand to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once releasedfrom the waste, plausible and specific types of management of the petitionedwaste, the quantities of waste generated, and any other additional factorswhich may characterize the petitioned waste. The Agency is proposing to use such information to identify plausible exposureroutes for hazardous constituents present in the waste and is proposingto use a particular fate and transport model to predict the concentrationof hazardous constituents that may be released from the petitioned wasteafter disposal and also to determine the potential impact of the unregulateddisposal of Nameplate's petitioned waste on human health and the environment.Specifically, the model will be used to predict compliance-point concentrationswhich will be compared directly to the levels of regulatory concern forparticular hazardous constituents. EPA believes that this model represents a reasonable worst case waste disposalscenario for the petitioned waste, and that a reasonable worst case scenariois appropriate when evaluating whether a waste should be relieved of theprotective management constraints of RCRA Subtitle C. Because a delistedwaste is no longer subject to hazardous waste control, the Agency is generallyunable to predict and does not control how a waste will be managed afterdelisting. Therefore, EPA currently believes that it is inappropriate forthe Delisting Program to consider extensive site-specific factors. Forexample, a generator may petition the Agency for delisting of a metal hydroxidesludge which is currently being managed in an on-site landfill and providedata on the nearest drinking water well, permeability of the aquifer, dispersivities,etc. If the Agency were to base its evaluation solely on these site-specificfactors, the Agency might conclude that the waste, at that specific location,cannot affect the closest well, and the Agency might grant the petition.Upon promulgation of the exclusion, however, the generator is under noobligation to continue to manage the waste at the on-site landfill. Infact, it is likely that the generator will either chose to send the delistedwaste off-site immediately, or will eventually reach the capacity of theon-site facility and subsequently send the waste off-site to a facilitywhich may have very different hydrogeological. and exposure conditions.The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoringdata to its evaluation of delisting petitions. In this case, the Agencydetermined that, because Nameplate is seeking a delisting for waste containedin an inactive surface impoundment, ground-water monitoring data collectedfrom the area where Nameplate stores the waste are necessary to determinewhether hazardous constituents have migrated from the unit to the underlyingground water. Because the petitioned waste is stored (and disposed, ifthe petition is granted) on-site, ground-water data collected from Nameplate'smonitoring wells are compared directly to the levels of regulatory concernfor particular hazardous constituents detected in the ground water andwill help to characterize the potential impact (if any) of the unregulateddisposal of Nameplate's petitioned waste on human health and the environment.Finally, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 specificallyrequire the Agency to provide notice and an opportunity for comment beforegranting or denying a final exclusion. Thus, final decisions will not bemade on this petition proposed today until all public comments (includingthose at requested hearings, if any) are addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Petition </ITAG>U.S. Nameplate Company, Incorporated, Mount Vernon, Iowa. 1. Petition for Exclusion U.S. Nameplate Company Incorporated (Nameplate), located in Mount Vernon,Iowa, manufactures etched nameplates. Nameplate petitioned the Agency toexclude the sludge contained in its on-site, unlined, surface impoundment.This sludge is presently listed as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006_``Wastewatertreatment sludges from electroplating operations except from the followingprocesses: (1) Sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum; (2) tin plating oncarbon steel; (3) zinc plating (segregated basis) on carbon steel; (4)aluminum or zinc-aluminum plating on carbon steel; (5) cleaning/strippingassociated with tin, zinc and aluminum plating on carbon steel; and (6)chemical etching and milling of aluminum.'' The listed constituents ofconcern for F006 wastes are cadmium, hexavalent chromium, nickel, and cyanide(complexed).Nameplate petitioned to exclude its waste, claiming that the waste doesnot meet the criteria for which it was listed. Nameplate also claims thatits treatment process generated a non-hazardous waste because the constituentsof concern, although present in the waste, are in an essentially immobileform. Nameplate further claims that its surface impoundment sludge is nothazardous for any other reason. Review of this petition included considerationof the original listing criteria, as well as the additional factors requiredby the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. See section 222 ofthe Amendments, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f); 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)-(4). Today's proposalto grant the petition in part is the result of the Agency's evaluationof Nameplate's petition in light of Nameplate's subsequent retreatmentof its sludge. 2. Background On December 18, 1984, Nameplate petitioned the Agency to exclude its wastewatertreatment sludge. On July 23, 1986, the Agency proposed to deny Nameplate'spetition based on the fact that the surface impoundment sludge containedexcessive total concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE). See 51 FR 26428for a complete description of Nameplate's manufacturing and waste treatmentprocesses, for a discussion of the Agency's previously proposed decisionto deny Nameplate's petition, and for a discussion of ground-water contamination,primarily TCE contamination, indicated at Nameplate's facility. As a resultof the proposed decision to deny this petition, Nameplate attempted toreduce the waste's total concentration of TCE through mechanical aerationof the impounded waste. During the public comment period, Nameplate requestedthat the Agency re-evaluate the retreated waste. In order to verify the representative nature of the data submitted by petitioners,the Agency randomly selects some percentage of petitioning facilities tovisit as part of its spot-check sampling and analysis program. In the spot-checkprogram, EPA performs limited analyses to assess waste samples for thepresence of EP toxic metals, nickel, cyanide, and the priority pollutants(a subset of the constituents of concern, which includes the volatile,semi-volatile acid extractable and base/neutral extractable compounds,and the organochlorine pesticides/polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) listedin Appendix VIII). The Agency has limited its spot-check search to thesecompounds because this is solely a quality assurance verification, ratherthan a data submission analysis, because of the expense of conducting completescans for all constituents of concern, and because a complete scan wouldusually not be necessary to detect those constituents most likely to bepresent in common industrial wastestreams. EPA Headquarters routinely reviewsall of the spot-check data in order both to verify the quality of the analyticaldata presented by the petitioner and to determine whether the petitionerhas submitted (or omitted) analytical data quantifying the concentrationsof the listed and non-listed constituents of concern present in the petitionedwastestream. On August 12, 1986, as part of the Agency's spot-check sampling and verificationprogram, EPA Headquarters conducted a spot-check sampling visit at Nameplate'sfacility. For surface impoundments like Nameplate's, petitioners are normallyrequired to divide the unit into four quadrants and to collect five full-depthcore samples from each quadrant. See ``Test Methods for Evaluating SolidWastes: Physical/Chemical Methods,'' U.S. EPA Office of Solid Waste andEmergency Response, Publication SW-846 (third edition), November 1986,and ``Petitions to Delist Hazardous Wastes_A Guidance Manual,'' U.S. EPA,Office of Solid Waste (EPA/530-SW-85-003), April 1985. The five full-depthcore samples are then composited (mixed) by quadrant to produce a totalof four composite samples. The Agency divided Nameplate's 85 foot by 56 foot surface impoundment intofour quadrants and randomly collected 11 full-depth core samples from eachquadrant. An additional full-depth core sample was randomly collected fromquadrant A of the surface impoundment, raising to 45 the total number offull-depth core samples collected. Each core sample was collected by drivinga coring device through the waste until the bottom of the surface impoundmentwas reached (the depth of the sludge ranged from one to three feet), thuscollecting a representative core sample of all the layers of retreatedsludge in the surface impoundment. Table l illustrates how the Agency compositedthe full-depth core samples for the various analyses performed. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s20,10,12 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Compositing of Samples for Analysis </T4><H1>Sample identification </H1><H1>Volatile organics (sample number) </H1><H1>EP toxic metals, nickel, cyanide, and priority pollutants (sample number)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad A1+A2 <D>1 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad A3+A4 <D>2 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad A5+A6 <D>3 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad A7+A8 <D>4 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad A9+A10 <D>5 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad A11+A12 <D>6 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad B1+B2 <D>7 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad B3+B4 <D>8 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad B5+B6 <D>9 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad B7+B8 <D>10 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad B9+B10+B11 <D>11 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad C1+C2 <D>12 </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad C3+C4 <D>13 </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad C5+C6 <D>14 </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad C7+C8 <D>15 </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad C9+C10+C11 <D>16 </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad D1+D2 <D>17 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad D3+D4 <D>18 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad D5+D6 <D>19 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad D7+D8 <D>20 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quad D9+D10+D11 <D>21 </D><D>4</D></ITAG></ITAG>As illustrated in Table 1, twenty-one composite samples were analyzed forvolatile organic compounds and four composite samples were analyzed forthe remaining priority pollutants, EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide.The Agency also collected one sample of ground water from Nameplate's upgradientmonitoring well and another from its single downgradient monitoring wellto determine if Nameplate's impounded waste was contaminating the underlyingground water. As recommended by the Technical Enforcement Guidance Document,the ground-water samples were not filtered in the field. See ``RCRA Ground-WaterMonitoring Technical Enforcement Guidance Document (TEGD),'' EPA, September1986. Both samples of ground water were analyzed for the priority pollutants,EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide. On February 23, 1987, the Agencyannounced the availability of the spot-check and verification data andrequested public comment on the data in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. See 52 FR 5472. No public comments were receivedon this notice. Since the Agency's spot-check visit, Nameplate has submitted three roundsof monitoring data. Nameplate's ground-water monitoring data only consistedof analysis and results for TCE, which were submitted in an attempt tochallenge the EPA Headquarters spot-check data and the EPA Region VII datademonstrating the presence of TCE. See 51 FR 26428, July 23, I986 for adiscussion of the EPA Region VII ground-water monitoring data. 3. Agency Analysis The Agency used SW-846 method numbers 8240, 8270, and 8080 to quantifythe total constituent concentrations (<T3>i.e., </T3>mg of a particular constituent per kg of waste) of the prioritypollutants in Nameplate's waste. Detection limits for the volatile compoundsranged between 0.049 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg, except for acetone, which was1.3 mg/kg. The detection limit for the semi-volatile acid and base/neutralextractable compounds was 1.1 mg/kg and the detection limit for the pesticideswas 0.002 mg/kg. These detection limits represent the lowest concentrationsquantifiable by the Agency, when using the appropriate SW-846 analyticalmethods to analyze Nameplate's waste. (Detection limits may vary accordingto the waste and waste matrix being analyzed, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices vary and ``dirty''waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising the detection limit.)The Agency did not detect any priority pollutants except TCE. The maximumtotal constituent concentration of TCE was 1.5 mg/kg. The Agency used SW-846 method numbers 6010, 7040-7951, and 9010 to quantifythe total constituent concentrations and SW-846 Method Number 1310 to quantifythe leachabIe concentrations (<T3>i.e., </T3>mg of a particular constituent per liter of extract) ofthe EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide in Nameplate's waste. Table 2presents the maximum total constituent concentrations and EP leachate concentrationsof the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide. Using SW-846 method number 3540, the Agency determined that Nameplate'swaste had a maximum oil and grease content of 0.26 percent; therefore,the EP analyses did not have to be modified in accordance with the OilyWaste EP methodology (i.e.. wastes having more than one percent total oiland grease may have significant concentrations of the constituent of concernin the oil phase, and thus, their presence would not be assessed usingthe standard EP leachate procedure). See SW-846 method number 1330. Noneof the samples analyzed exhibited the characteristics of ignitability,corrosivity, or reactivity. See 40 CFR 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s20,10.2,8.4 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Maximum Concentrations Retreated Surface Impoundment Sludge (ppm)</T4><H1>Constituents</H1><H1>Total constituent concentration</H1><H1>EP leachate concentration</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>8.0</D><D>andless;0.01 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium<D> 170</D><D>andless;0.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>andless;2.9</D><D>andless;0.01 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>390</D><D>andless;0.05 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>andless;29</D><D>andless;0.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D>0.07</D><D>andless;0.0002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium<D>andless;1.4</D><D>andless;0.01 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver<D>andless;1.4</D><D>andless;0.01 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>58</D><D>0.28 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide<D>0.37</D><D>\1\ 0.02 </D><F>\1\ Calculated by assuming a dilution factor of 20 times (based on 100grams of sample and dilution of 2,000 mls of water) and a theoretical worstcase leaching of 100 percent.</F></ITAG></ITAG> Nameplate submitted a signed certification stating that its surface impoundmentcontains approximately 422 cubic yards of retreated sludge (based on boththe size of the surface impoundment and depth of the retreated sludge).The Agency may review a petitioner's estimates and, on occasion, has requesteda petitioner to re-evaluate estimated waste volume. EPA accepts Nameplate'scertified estimate of 422 cubic yards. Analyses for the priority pollutants and the EP toxic metals, nickel, andcyanide were performed on the two groundwater samples (one upgradient sampleand one downgradient sample) collected by EPA Headquarters from Nameplate'ssite. Using detection limits of 0.002 mg/l, 0.05 mg/l, and 0.0001 mg/l,no volatile or semi-volatile (acid extractable and base/neutral extractable)compounds, or priority pollutant pesticides, respectively, were detectedin either sample, except for TCE. (Due to the ``cleanliness'' of the ground-watersample matrices, it was possible to achieve detection limits lower thanthose achieved in the analysis of the sludge samples.) TCE was not detected(<T3>i.e., </T3>the concentration was andless;0.002 mg/l) at Nameplate's upgradientwell. TCE, however, was detected at a concentration of 0.012 mg/l at Nameplate'sdowngradient monitoring well. Neither sample contained concentrations ofany of the EP toxic metals, nickel, or cyanide in excess of their respectivelevels of regulatory concern (<T3>i.e., </T3>the concentration of each of the EP toxic metals, nickel,and cyanide was below its respective regulatory standard). As mentioned earlier, Nameplate submitted three rounds of ground-watermonitoring data (collected in 1986/1987) for TCE. Nameplate has not submittedanalyses for any other constituents, nor has Nameplate installed a monitoringsystem that complies with the requirements stated in 40 CFR Part 265, SubpartF. See 51 FR 26428 for a discussion of the inadequacies of Nameplate'smonitoring system. The results of the first round of Nameplate's monitoringdata did not reveal TCE in either the upgradient or the downgradient monitoringwell; however, Nameplate's laboratory used a detection limit of 0.004 mg/l(which was greater than the regulatory standard for TCE at that time of0.0032 mg/l). The Agency informed Nameplate that its initial detectionlimit was too high and that the detection limit used in subsequent analysesmust be lower (at least andless;0.003 mg/l). Nameplate's second round ofground-water monitoring samples was analyzed using a lower detection limit(andless;0.002 mg/l) and revealed that TCE was not present in either theupgradient or downgradient monitoring well (<T3>i.e., </T3>the concentration of TCE in the ground water was andless;0.002mg/l). Nameplate's third round of ground-water monitoring samples was analyzedusing an even lower detection limit (andless;0.0005 mg/l) and revealed thatTCE was now present at the downgradient monitoring well at a concentrationof 0.0056 mg/l. TCE was not detected at the upgradient monitoring well.In Nameplate's case, TCE has been detected on three occasions, by EPA Headquarters(spot-check data), by EPA's Region VII office (see 51 FR 26428), and byNameplate (once each), while on two other occasions TCE was not detectedby Nameplate. Both the detected values and non-detected values of TCE camefrom the same inadequate downgradient monitoring well. Because Nameplate'smonitoring system is inadequate, it is not possible to characterize theextent of dispersion of the traveling plume of TCE contamination and, therefore,it is not possible to determine which ground-water samples are statisticallyvalid (<T3>i.e., </T3>without any data characterizing the geology and hydrogeologyof Nameplate's site, it is not possible to determine the statistical validityof either the detected values or the non-detected values). In Nameplate'scase, EPA, therefore, believes that it cannot use the non-detected valuesto refute the detected values. 4. Agency Evaluation Nameplate stated in its petition that, if its petition is granted, thesurface impoundment will be closed and the petitioned waste will remainin the closed surface impoundment. The Agency considered the appropriatenessof alternative disposal scenarios for wastes disposed in closed surfaceimpoundments and decided that a landfill scenario is the most reasonable,worst-case scenario because Subpart K of Part 265 specifies that a closedsurface impoundment, still containing wastes, is subject to the post-closurecare requirements for landfills under Subpart G of Part 265 and also andSection;265.310 (<T3>i.e., </T3>to remove free liquids, to cap the surface impoundment,etc.). Under this disposal scenario, the major exposure route of concernfor any hazardous constituents would be ingestion of contaminated groundwater. The Agency, therefore, evaluated the petitioned waste using itsvertical and horizontal spread (VHS) landfill model which predicts theleachability and potential for ground-water contamination from wastes thatare landfilled. See 50 FR 7882 (February 26, 1985), 50 FR 48896 (November27, 1985), and the RCRA public docket for these notices for a detaileddescription of the VHS model and its parameters. This modelling approach,which includes a ground-water transport scenario, was used with conservative,generic parameters, to predict reasonable worst-case contaminant levelsin ground water at a hypothetical receptor well (<T3>i.e., </T3>the model estimates the ability of an aquifer to dilutethe toxicant from a specific volume of waste). The Agency requests commentson the use of the VHS model as applied to the evaluation of Nameplate'swaste. Specifically, the Agency used the VHS model to evaluate the mobility ofcyanide and nickel from Nameplate's waste. The Agency's evaluation, usingthe waste volume of 422 cubic yards and the maximum EP leachate concentrationsof cyanide and nickel in the VHS model, generated the compliance-pointconcentrations shown in Table 3. The Agency did not evaluate the mobilityof the remaining inorganic constituents (e.g., arsenic, barium, cadmium,chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver) from Nameplate's waste becausethey were not detected in the EP extract (see Table 2) using the appropriateSW-846 analytical test methods. The Agency believes that it is inappropriateto evaluate non-detectable concentrations of a constituent of concern inits modelling efforts if the non-detectable value was obtained using theappropriate analytical method. Specifically, if a constituent cannot bedetected (when using the appropriate analytical method) the Agency assumesthat the constituent is not present and therefore does not present a threatto either human health or the environment. In this case, even the use ofthe detection limits (presented in Table 2) in the VHS model does not yieldcompliance-point concentrations above health-based levels. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,14,8.2 </C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>VHS: Calculated Compliance-Point Concentrations Retreated Surface ImpoundmentSludge (Mg/l)</T4><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Compliance-point concentration </H1><H1>Regulatory standard</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.0086  </D><D>0.50 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide <D>andless;0.0006  </D><D>0.2</D></ITAG></ITAG> The retreated sludge exhibited nickel levels at the compliance point belowthe Agency's standard of 0.50 mg/l. See Verified Reference Doses (RfDs)of the U.S. EPA, ORD/ECAO-CIN-475, January 1986. The concentration of cyanideat the compliance point is below the Agency's standard of 0.2 ppm. SeeVerified Reference Doses (RfDs) of the U.S. EPA, ORD/ECAO-CIN-475, January1986. Additionally, because the concentration of total cyanide is lessthan 0.37 ppm, the concentration of reactive cyanide will be below theAgency's interim standard of 250 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Threshold forToxic Gas Generation,'' July 12, 1985, Internal Agency Memorandum in theRCRA public docket.The Agency also calculated the mobile portion of the total constituentconcentrations of TCE using the organic leachate model (OLM). See 51 FR41082, November 13, 1986. The compliance-point concentration of leachableTCE was then evaluated using the VHS model, which predicted a concentrationof 0.0013 mg/1 for TCE. Thus, TCE is present in concentrations below the0.005 mg/1 level of regulatory concern. See Internal Agency Memorandumdated October 24, 1986, entitled ``Derivation of Health-based Criteriafor the Delisting Effort,'' in the RCRA public docket, for an explanationof the derivation of this regulatory standard. Retreatment has substantiallyreduced these levels from the levels described in the Agency's previousproposal to deny Nameplate's petition. See 51 FR 26428, July 23, 1986.At that time, TCE was found to be present in 19 of 21 samples at concentrationsof regulatory concern sufficient to warrant denying the petition. The Agencyhas concluded that the reduced concentrations of TCE no longer warrantdenying delisting of Nameplate's retreated waste because of the presenceof TCE. Additionally, the Agency does not believe that there are any otherhazardous constituents present at concentrations of regulatory concernnor other factors that might cause Nameplate's retreated waste to be hazardous.Nevertheless, the ground-water contamination with TCE supports the Agency'scontention that the unit at one time held a hazardous waste. By mechanicallyaerating the impounded sludge, Nameplate volatilized a large portion ofthe TCE, thus leaving only a maximum of 1.5 mg/kg of TCE in the sludge.The Agency does not believe that this low level of TCE is sufficient tocause the levels of ground-water contamination found by both EPA Headquartersand EPA Region VII. The Agency is unable to conclude that the impoundedsludge, prior to retreatment, did not cause and is not continuing to causethe ground-water contamination. 5. Conclusion Because the Agency collected more than two times the required minimum numberof samples from Nameplate's surface impoundment, the Agency believes thatthe results of the August 1986 spot-check sampling and verification accuratelycharacterize the physical and chemical nature of Nameplate's retreatedsurface impoundment sludge. Past analyses of Nameplate's waste (performedby Nameplate and by EPA Region VII, and discussed in the July 23, 1986notice, 51 FR 26428) provide historical information concerning the physicaland chemical nature of the impounded sludge prior to retreatment in July1986. The Agency is basing its present evaluation of Nameplate's retreatedwaste on the data collected during the August 1986 spot-check and verificationsampling trip, on the ground-water monitoring data submitted by EPA RegionVII and Nameplate, and on the petitioned data for the waste prior to retreatment.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Retreated Waste </ITAG>The Agency believes that Nameplate has successfully demonstrated that Nameplate'sretreated wastewater treatment sludge is not hazardous. The Agency, therefore,is proposing that Nameplate's retreated waste be considered non-hazardous,as it should not present a significant hazard to either human health orthe environment. The Agency, therefore, proposes to grant a one-time exclusionto U.S. Nameplate Company, Incorporated, located in Mount Vernon, Iowa,for its retreated wastewater treatment sludge described in its petitionas EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006. If the proposed rule becomes effective,the retreated wastewater treatment sludge should no longer be subject toregulation under 40 CFR Parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standardsof 40 CFR Part 270. If made final, the exclusion will only apply to the retreated wastewatertreatment sludges covered by Nameplate's demonstration. Although management of the waste covered by this petition would be relievedfrom Subtitle C jurisdiction upon final promulgation of an exclusion, thegenerator of a delisted waste must either treat, store, or dispose of thewaste in an on-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered toan off-site storage, treatment, or disposal facility, either of which ispermitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrialsolid waste. Alternatively, the delisted waste may be delivered to a facilitythat beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaimsthe waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recycling,or reclamation.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Residual Waste at Nameplate's Surface Impoundment </ITAG>EPA's decisions to exclude a waste from Subtitle C control are typicallyretrospective and typically deregulate, from Subtitle C control, thosewaste management units holding the petitioned waste, because such unitswould not be considered to have received a hazardous waste. See 40 CFR260.10(a) for the definition of a hazardous waste unit. However, in caseswhere the original petitioned wastestream has been retreated (through aeration,chemical stabilization, reprocessing, etc.), the Agency may distinguishbetween the original petitioned waste and the newly retreated waste. Thatis, the delisting decision on the retreated waste may be prospective (effectivefrom the date of retreatment forward) and may apply only to the retreatedwaste. When treated wastes are hazardous, remaining residues (<T3>e.g., </T3>sludge and soil/sludge mixtures) containing or derived fromthe treated waste prior to retreatment are hazardous by definition, continueto be hazardous until excluded, and continue to constitute part of thewaste management unit. See 40 CFR 261.3 (c)(2)(i) and (d)(2). A delistingdecision for the retreated waste, therefore, does not affect the regulatorystatus of the unit which held the treated hazardous waste, if there isreason to believe that the treated waste was hazardous, and if waste residuescontaining or derived from the treated waste may still be present or ifthe waste already contaminated or is likely to contaminate the ground waterin the future. Such units, therefore, continue to be classified as hazardouswaste continue to constitute part of the waste management unit. See 40CFR 261.3 (c)(2)(i) and (d)(2). A delisting decision for the retreatedwaste, therefore, does not affect the regulatory status of the unit whichheld the treated hazardous waste, if there is reason to believe that thetreated waste was hazardous, and if waste residues containing or derivedfrom the treated waste may still be present or if the waste already contaminatedor is likely to contaminate the ground water in the future. Such units,therefore, continue to be classified as hazardous waste units subject toall Subtitle C requirements, including closure requirements. Nameplate's originally petitioned waste (prior to retreatment) containedTCE. As discussed in the July 23, 1986, proposal, EPA's Region VII Officehad determined that TCE was present in the ground water beneath Nameplate'sfacility. The Agency's spot-check visit confirmed the presence of TCE inground water, identifying a concentration of 0.012 mg/l in the downgradientmonitoring well. The concentration of TCE detected in the downgradientwell exceeds the current regulatory limit of 0.005 mg/l for TCE in drinkingwater. Since Nameplate's original waste contained TCE at sufficient levelsto contaminate ground water, and ground-water contamination with TCE ispresent, the Agency is concerned that Nameplate's original waste may beresponsible. The Agency, therefore, proposes to limit the scope of today's decisionto grant an exclusion only to Nameplate's regulated as such under 40 CFRParts 260 through 268 and the permitting standards of 40 CFR Part 270.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Effective Date </ITAG>This rule, if promulgated, will become effective immediately. The Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allowrules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated communitydoes not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is thecase here, because this rule, if promulgated, would reduce the existingrequirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In addition, thedenial of exclusion for the residual waste from the treated hazardous waste,if promulgated, does not change the existing requirements for this surfaceimpoundment to operate as a hazardous waste management unit. In light ofthe unnecessary hardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitionerby an effective date six months after promulgation and the fact that asix-month deadline is not necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010,EPA believes that the exclusion and denial should be effective immediatelyupon promulgation. These reasons also provide a basis for making this ruleeffective immediately, upon promulgation, under the Administrative ProceduresAct, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This proposal to grant an exclusion for a petitioned waste and to denyexclusion of residual wastes at the unit handling these wastes is not major,since its effect, if promulgated, would be to reduce the overall costsand economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste management regulations. Thisreduction would be achieved by excluding waste generated at a specificfacility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facilityto treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additional impact, therefore,due to today's rule. This proposal is not a major regulation, therefore,no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran Agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e., </T3>small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. This amendment, if promulgated, will not have an adverse economic impacton small entities since its effect would be to reduce the overall costsof EPA's hazardous waste regulations and would be limited to one facility.Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatoryflexibility analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261 </ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 3001 RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 26, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.W.
