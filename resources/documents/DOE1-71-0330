The authors investigated the errors using two films at 5{sup 0}(S/H = 7), 10{sup 0} (S/H = 4), 15{sup 0} (S/H = 2.5), and 20{sup 0}(S/H = 2) from a simulator and a commercial stereo reconstruction algorithm.Seven seeds on faces of an 8-cm cube served as the test object. Anglesof 10{sup 0}, 16%, and 20{sup 0} yielded errors of andless; 1 mm in the (x,y)coordinates and andless; 2 mm in the (z) coordinate.</TEXT></DOC>
