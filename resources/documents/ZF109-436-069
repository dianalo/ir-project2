With the increase in program size and thedecrease in memory costs over the last few years, users will have to get usedto larger systems and programs.andP;  Any user who expects to use PageMaker 4.0with all their fonts installed and only 1 MB of memory is asking for trouble.andO;This is a power product which requires a powerful machine to get the fullbenefit from it.andM;PUMA RATINGSandM;PERFORMANCE/PRICE: 3.andP;  The performance of PageMaker 4.0 is highly dependenton the amount of memory available.andP;  With only 1 megabyte (MB) of memory, apared down System running with the Finder would be the physical minimum.andO;However, with the proliferation of fonts for DTP work, even 2 MB of RAM wouldbe the realistic minimum, and the Multifinder is still out of the question.andO;The amount of reasonable memory to suffer minimum speed loss would be around4 MB.andP;  Other than these memory considerations, PageMaker performs well andalthough the price may be daunting to the first-off user looking for a DTPpackage, it is what people are coming to expect from software with the powerPageMaker has.andM;USEFULNESS: 4.andP;  PageMaker has always been a useful program with limitations.andO;The limitations have been much reduced in version 4.0 but some still existnonetheless (no doubt, Aldus will have a &quot;much improved&quot; version 5.0 ...).andO;Overall the program is a solid DTP product, and such features as the table ofcontents and index creation facilities, when combined to the book feature andincreased publication size, help PageMaker address it's previously weaklarge- publication handling.andP;  Although some programs (Ventura on the IBM, andsoon on the Mac, or Xpress on the Mac) offer many features not found inPageMaker, it still retains a very clear user-interface, which allows usersto master the program quicker, thereby increasing the usefulness of theproduct.andM;MANUAL: 4.andP;  As is always the case with Aldus, the PageMaker manual is clearand comprehensive.andP;  For users of previous versions, the manuals are onlyneeded to grasp the more esoteric of the new features.andP;  The manuals have beendivided into logical topics, and each section has numerous illustratedexamples.andM;AVAILABILITY: 4.andP;  As with all Aldus products, PageMaker 4.0 is widelyavailable through normal channels.andP;  Support is available through Aldus, orthough the distributor in countries other than the U.S.andM;(Sean McNamara/19900713)</TEXT></DOC>
