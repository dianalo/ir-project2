On May 31, 1972 (37 FR 10842 at10894) EPA approved the SIP for Tennessee. The SIP contained a sectionthat recognized the Air Pollution Control Section of the Memphis and ShelbyCounty Health Department as the local agency for air pollution controland included a control strategy demonstration along with the Health Departmentregulations. Since that time, the Memphis and Shelby County Air PollutionControl Section (Memphis) has revised the regulations. Memphis adoptedcertain portions of the State regulations, revised their old regulationsand recodified the air pollution control section of the Memphis and ShelbyCounty Code accordingly. The new regulations were submitted to EPA by the State of Tennessee asa SIP revision (Board Order 17-86) on July 7, 1986. This SIP revision wasnot processed earlier because it was unclear which Memphis/Shelby Countyregulations had already been approved as part of the Tennessee SIP. Also,EPA had to determine if the previous control strategy demonstrations wereadequate in protecting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).Once the federally approved Memphis/Shelby County portion of the TennesseeSIP was compiled and the previous control strategy demonstrations weredeemed adequate, EPA decided to approve the Memphis/Shelby regulationsas a transfer of enforcement authority from the State to the local. Thefollowing conditions and conclusions were used to arrive at this decision:1. The local regulations must be equal to the corresponding federally approvedState regulations. 2. The local regulations cannot be treated as separable from the SIP, whichthe State submits and implements, but must be considered part of it.3. Tennessee State law requires that the local regulations be equivalentto or not less stringent than the corresponding State regulation; therefore,Tennessee must certify to EPA that each regulation has been reviewed bythe State and found to meet this requirement. 4. Tennessee must retain overall authority and responsibility for developingand implementing, including enforcing, the SIP. EPA compared the federally approved State regulations and the federallyapproved Memphis regulations to determine the approvability of the Memphisregulations. A summary of the review follows.

The deviations, however, do not affectthe approvability of the Volatile Organic Compounds Regulation for Memphisbecause approvability of the local regulations is based on a transfer ofenforcement authority of federally approved regulations, which includethe Volatile Organic Compounds Regulation, from the State to the local.Once Tennessee has corrected these deviations identified by EPA, Memphiswill adopt the corrected regulation by reference. <ITAG tagnum="26">Section 16-84_<T3>Particulate Matter from Incinerators </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section 16-85_<T3>Required Sampling, Recording and Reporting </T3>(State regulation 1200-3-10)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section 16-86_<T3>Methods of Sampling and Analysis </T3>(State regulation 1200-3-12)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section 16-87_<T3>Limits on Emissions due to Malfunctions, Startups and Shutdowns </T3>(Stateregulation 1200-3-20) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section 16-89_<T3>Fugitive Dust </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section 16-90_<T3>General Alternative Emission Standards </T3>(State regulation 1200-3-21)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section 16-91_<T3>Lead Emission Standards </T3>(State regulation 1200-3-22)</ITAG>Sections 16-76 and 16-81 are the <T3>New Source Performance Standards </T3>and <T3>Hazardous Air Contaminants, </T3>respectively.
