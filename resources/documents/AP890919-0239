The statement came as IBM announced, as expected, that it wascommitting itself to computer-aided software engineering, or CASE.IBM's endorsement is expected to give a large boost to the high-techfield, which already garners about $300 million in annual revenue.   Software engineering is intended to replace disorganized methodsof software-writing that have led to chaotic, unmanageable andfailure-prone programs for large computers.   Consultants said IBM's promise of experts to help customers wasan important part of the announcement, since the transition tosoftware engineering promises to be a real test of programmers'flexibility.   ``The limiting factor on the introduction of CASE technology isthe ability of information systems shops to cope with a radicallynew culture. It is going to take them quite some years,'' said IanPalmer, chairman of James Martin Associates in Reston, Va.   ``It's going to require an investment, not just of the company'stime but of a person's ability to recycle themselves, re-engineerthemselves,'' said Dick Welsh, the Dallas-based director ofinformation systems consulting markets for Ernst andamp; Young.   Some of the 20,000 experts will come from IBM and some from fouroutside firms designated by IBM: CAP Gemini America, Computer PowerGroup, Computer Task Group and GE Consulting.   IBM is calling its offering AD-Cycle. Its strategy relies heavilyon existing software-development tools marketed by other companiesthat beat IBM to the market, particularly KnowledgeWare Inc.,Bachman Information Systems Inc. and Index Technology Inc.   More than 30 companies on Tuesday announced their support forIBM's plan, which will roll out over the next several years.   This may be the farthest IBM has ever gone in using othercompanies' products as a central part of its own strategy, saidGeorge Conrades, an IBM senior vice president. ``It's a high-watermark, but it's an ever-rising tide,'' he said in an interview.</TEXT></DOC>
