The solvents, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, canalso liberate chlorine that destroys ozone high in thestratosphere, just as the better-known chlorofluorocarbon or CFCcompounds do, said the Environmental Policy Institute in a study ofthe ozone problem.   Arjun Makhijani, an engineer and consultant who was principalauthor of the study, said methyl chloroform, the most commonindustrial solvent, probably accounts for one-quarter of currentozone destruction.   The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance, principal tradeassociation of manufacturers and major users of solvents containingchlorine, said it believed the institute had relied on outdatedscience and had overstated the potency of the two solvents.   Steve Seidel, an ozone expert at the Environmental ProtectionAgency, said very little carbon tetrachloride is escaping to theatmosphere and methyl chloroform is a ``definitely second tier''source of ozone destruction.   About 124,000 tons of methyl chloroform are used worldwide eachyear, the institute said. U.S. use, for such tasks as degreasingmetal in the auto industry, is about 35 percent of that total.   Some 227,000 tons of carbon tetrachloride are used each year, 80percent of it as a raw material for production ofchlorofluorocarbon compounds. Analysts including Makijani agreethat production will decline as CFC production drops under the 1987treaty calling for 50 percent cuts by 1998.   Methyl chloroform stays in the atmosphere only nine or 10 yearson average before breaking down, said Makhijani. So short alifetime means ``80 percent of methyl chloroform never gets to thestratosphere. But because there's so much of it, the 30 percentthat reaches the stratosphere is more destructive than CFC-113,''one of the solvents regulated by the treaty, he said.   Because the lifetime is so short, reductions in emissions wouldmean an early decline in atmospheric chlorine, he said. The CFCcompounds can last more than a century, and the atmospheric backlogplus all that has accumulated in earth-bound products such asrefrigerators means the effects of production cuts will be a longtime showing an effect.   ``We have a few problems with the numbers they used thismorning,'' said Tom Cortina, spokesman for the industry group.``Five to 10 percent is probably a more accurate'' estimate ofozone destruction from methyl chloroform.   Controls are not needed on either solvent, but if they are``they should be based on international agreement,'' said fellowspokesman Steve Risotto.   Seidel of EPA said the agency estimated that methyl chloroformwas only about 10 percent as destructive of ozone as the mostpowerful CFC compound.</TEXT></DOC>
