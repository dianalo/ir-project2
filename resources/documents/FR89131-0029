Determination To Issue an Interim Rule </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-42, Item I. </T3>A determination has been made under authorityof the Secretary of Defense (DoD), the Administrator of General Services(GSA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) to issue the regulations in Item I of FAC 84-42 as an interim rule.This action is necessary because_ The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Federal ProcurementPolicy (OFPP), published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 29, 1988, (53 FR 52889) an interimpolicy directive with comments due February 15, 1989, implementing therequirements of Pub. L. 100-656, Title VII of the ``Business OpportunityDevelopment Reform Act of 1988.'' DoD, GSA, and NASA have determined that compelling reasons exist to promulgatean interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. However,pursuant to Pub. L. 98-577 and FAR 1.501, public comments received in responseto this interim rule will be considered in formulating a final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Public Comments </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-42, Item II. </T3>On January 15, 1985, an interim rule was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 2268).

L. 96-511) does not apply because these final rules do not imposeany reporting or recordkeeping requirements or collection of informationfrom offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require theapproval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. <ITAG tagnum="84">D.

L. 96-354)does not apply because each revision is not a ``significant revision''as defined in FAR 1.501-1; i.e., it does not alter the substantive meaningof any coverage in the FAR having a significant cost or administrativeimpact on contractors or offerors, or a significant effect beyond the internaloperating procedures of the issuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistentwith section 1212 of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertainingto publication of proposed regulations (as implemented in FAR Subpart 1.5,Agency and Public Participation), solicitation of agency and public viewson the revisions is not required. Since such solicitation is not required,the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.<T3>FAC 84-42, Item IX.</T3> DoD, GSA, and NASA certify that this finalrule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial numberof small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Actof 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the changes only implement in theFAR the final rules issued by the Department of Labor at 41 CFR 50-201.101(b)on March 10, 1988.     <T3>FAC 84-42, Item XI.</T3> DoD, GSA, NASA certify that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of smallentities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980,5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The majority of nonpersonal services contracts currentlyawarded contain provisions requiring health care providers to maintainliability insurance and indemnify the Government for liability producingacts by the contractor arising during contract performance. In addition,most states have adopted statutory provisions with respect to liabilityinsurance coverage by practitioners within their jurisdictions. The ruleis not expected to affect insurance rates which are based upon the medicalspecialty involved and locale of practice, as opposed to the class of beneficiaryaffected.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1, 4, 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22,25, 28, 32, 37, 48, and 52    </ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.

L. 100-656, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 29, 1988 (53 FR 52889).  Title VII of the ``Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988''seeks to test the effectiveness of eliminating set-asides in certain industriesthrough the establishment of a new program entitled the ``Small BusinessCompetitiveness Program.'' The program has two primary objectives: (a)To demonstrate whether small business firms in certain industry groupscan compete successfully on an unrestricted basis for Federal contracts;and (b) to demonstrate whether targeted goaling and management techniquescan expand Federal contract opportunities for small business in industrycategories where such opportunities historically have been low, despiteadequate numbers of small business contractors in the economy. The followingagencies have been identified as participants in the demonstration program:the Departments of Agriculture, Defense (except the Defense Mapping Agency),Energy, Health and Human Services, and Transportation, and the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, the General Services Administration, the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration, and the Veterans' Administration.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Item II_Publicizing Proposed Regulations  </ITAG>This item converts to a final rule the interim rule that was publishedas Item I of FAC 84-6 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2268), implementingsection 302 of the Small Business and Federal Competition Enhancement Actof 1984 (Pub. L. 98-577).  The final rule differs from the interim rule in that it provides additionalguidance in FAR 1.301 concerning the Paperwork Reduction Act and the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, pursuant to recommendations received in response to thepublication of the interim rule.  <ITAG tagnum="85">Item III_Clarification of Records Rentention Requirements  </ITAG>FAR 4.803(a)(8), 4.803(a)(10), and 4.805(n) are revised to clarify thatthe nonunique portions of unsuccessful offers and quotations need not beretained in the official contract file.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Item IV_Sealed Bid Documentation  </ITAG>FAR 6.401 requires contracting officers to document their reasons for notusing the sealed bid method of contracting. The Competition in ContractingAct (CICA) of 1984 requires that sealed bidding be used if certain criteriaare met. The Councils have determined that clarification of the existingFAR requirement for additional documentation is necessary. In its place,the Councils have modified the coverage to require only that the contractingofficer briefly explain, in writing, which of the four conditions in FAR6.401(a) was not met.  <ITAG tagnum="85">Item V_Documentation of Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Contracts  </ITAG>FAR 16.103(d) is revised to clarify when contract file documentation showingwhy the particular contract type was selected is required. For firm-fixedprice type contracts, documentation is only required for major systemsand research and development contracts.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Item VI_Five-Year Option Limitation  </ITAG>FAR 17.204(e) is revised to clarify that the 5-year limitation on contractscontaining options is not based on statute. The authority to waive therequirements in FAR 17.204(e) shall be approved in accordance with agencyprocedures.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Item VII_Approval and Option Clauses  </ITAG>The prescription at FAR 17.208(g) and the title of the clause prescribedtherein; i.e., the clause at 52.217-9, are revised to eliminate terminologythat restricts use of the clause to solicitations and contracts for services. The clauses at 52.204-1 and 52-217-6 through 52.217-9 and related clauseprefaces are revised to make them ``fill-in-the-blank'' type clauses ratherthan requiring necessary additional information to be provided elsewherein the contract (i.e., in the contract Schedule, rather than in SectionI).  <ITAG tagnum="84">Item VIII_Small Business Size Standards  </ITAG>FAR 19.102 is revised to incorporate changes made to the size standardsregulations as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by the Small Business Administration. The modifiedsize standard in the SIC Code 8731 of Major Group 87 pertaining to MiscellaneousServices was effective by issuance of a final rule on October 27, 1988(53 FR 43422).<ITAG tagnum="84">Item IX_Walsh-Healey Eligibility    </ITAG>FAR 22.608-2, 22.608-3, and 22.608-4 are revised to permit the award ofa contract under the urgency or substantial hardship conditions permittedby the Department of Labor (DOL) regulations (41 CFR 50-2011(b)(iii)(A))when it is found that an otherwise qualified small business concern maybe ineligible due to the provisions of Section 35(a) of the Walsh-HealeyAct and the case has been forwarded to the Small Business Administrationor DOL for review and final disposition. The DOL issued a final rule inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>, March 10, 1988 (53 FR 7741) on Walsh-Healeyeligibility procedures, effective May 9, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="85">Item X_Restrictions on Federal Public Works Projects    </ITAG>FAR Subpart 25.10, Restrictions on Federal Public Works Projects, the provisionat 52.225-12, Restrictions on Federal Public Works Projects Certifications,and the clause at 52.225-13, Restrictions on Federal Public Works Projectsare deleted.    Pub. L. 100-202 contained restrictions concerning the use of Federal fundsfor construction services and products on public works. The restrictions,which applied only to Japanese contractors, were implemented as Item I,FAC 84-36, published as an interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 12, 1988 (53 FR 12128).<ITAG tagnum="84">Item XI_Nonpersonal Healthcare Services    </ITAG>FAR 28.301 is revised, and Subpart 37.4 and the clause at 52.237-7 areadded to prescribe uniform procedures regarding nonpersonal services contractsfor health care services. Among other things, the revisions prescribe acontract clause requiring that health care providers (i.e., physicians,dentists, and other medical practitioners) maintain medical liability insuranceas a contract requirement and indemnify the Government against liabilityproducing acts or omissions by the contractor, its agents, and employeesoccurring during contract performance. Additionally, the clause clarifiesthe relationship of the parties, by providing the professional servicesrendered by the contractor are rendered in its capacity as an independentcontractor.<ITAG tagnum="85">Item XII_Value Engineering and OMB Circular A-131    </ITAG>FAR 48.001, 48.101, 48.102, 48.103, 48.104-1, 48.105, 48.201, and the clausesat 52.248-1 and 52.248-3 are revised to (1) include the changes that werein the proposed rule; and (2) implement OMB Circular A-131, Value Engineering,dated January 26, 1988, and published by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB). The Circular, addressed to Heads of Executive Departments and Establishments,requires the use of value engineering, as appropriate, by Federal departmentsand agencies to identify and reduce nonessential procurement and programcosts. The OMB Circular was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 3, 1988 (53 FR 3140).<ITAG tagnum="85">Item XIII_Diversion of Shipment Under F.O.B. Destination Contracts   </ITAG>FAR 52.247-54 is revised to require (when carrier rates are not publiclyfiled with any regulatory body) that contractors supply documentation supportingproposals for adjustment submitted under the Changes clause when the placeof delivery is changed by the performance. Permissible documentation includescopies of the transportation contract, letter agreement, or other writtencommunication quoting the rates/charges which would have been applied hadthe destination not been charged.    Therefore, 48 CFR Parts 1, 4, 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 25, 28, 32, 37,48, and 52 are amended as set forth below:    1.
