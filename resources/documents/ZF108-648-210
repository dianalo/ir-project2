(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DOS is the most widely used operating system in the world, but it has onemajor problem: it supports only one user doing one thing at a time.andP;  Thedevelopment of the 80286, 80386, and 80486 CPUs has been paralleled byoperating system enhancements.andP;  Multitasking and some multiuser capabilitiescan be tacked onto the DOS environment.andP;  Many offer considerably increasedflexibility of basic DOS but remain poor cousins to the powerful, multiuser,multitasking systems used on mainframes and minicomputers.andM;One of the most popular multiuser operating systems on larger machines isUNIX, which was developed by Bell Labs and is now licensed by ATandamp;T.andP;  With theintroduction of the 80286 chip, Microsoft recognized the possibility ofporting a version of UNIX to the microcomputer and the company licensed andintroduced a version of UNIX called XENIX.andP;  It was intended to give truemultiuser, multitasking capabilities similar to those UNIX gives smallermachines, while staying consistent with many of UNIX's commands andarchitecture.andM;XENIX has become a mature, sophisticated product that captures a considerablepercentage of the advanced microcomputer operating system market.andP;  Simplyput, DOS cannot extract the best performance out of an 80386 or 80486, butXENIX can.andP;  On an 80386, XENIX can easily support 16 users on dumb terminals,all performing one or more tasks, without causing machine bottlenecks.andM;XENIX has also become a logical alternative to DOS local area networks.andP;  Theslow performance of networks simply cannot compete with the speed of XENIX,nor with its installation and maintenance costs.andP;  The main attraction ofLANs, of course, is to use DOS-based applications that could not run underXENIX.andP;  Now, DOS emulators in XENIX provide all the functions of DOS.andP;  Moreimportantly, many software vendors recognize the new market and port theirproducts to XENIX.andM;The growth of XENIX and similar operating systems is inevitable.andP;  The 80386-and 80486-based machines are powerful enough for departmental computing.andO;Also, XENIX's similarity to UNIX has made it a logical alternative tominicomputers on expensive LANs.andP;  By maintaining UNIX compatibility, XENIXand similar systems provide a communications path between smaller machinesand large systems running UNIX (from small minicomputers to Craysupercomputers) with no compatibility problems.andM;The original port of UNIX to XENIX opened the gate for similar operatingsystems and ports.andP;  Several companies offer XENIX products, and UNIX is nowavailable as a complete product for 80386- and 80486-based machines.andP;  Inaddition, several competing products that emulate UNIX on microcomputers havebeen introduced.andM;This review examines the primary multiuser operating system products for the8OX86 microcomputer.andP;  It does not attempt to cover every variant, which wouldbe almost meaningless.andP;  All the products were examined for variation from theUNIX standard as defined by ATandamp;T's latest release, and all except QNX met thebase requirements.andP;  ESIX's UNIX product was received too late for inclusion.andM;Two main XENIX products are covered  from Santa Cruz Operation andInteractive Systems) as is the new SCO UNIX release for 80386 systems.andP;  Arival operating system from Quantum Software called QNX is examined as analternative to the standard fare in XENIX and UNIX products.andM;No benchmarks were used here: they are meaningless when discussing the variedproducts involved.andP;  Instead, the aim is to give you an idea of the systemsavailable for multiusers on advanced CPUs.andM;The six-member review team installed and used each system as a stand-aloneoperating system with multiple virtual terminals on the main console.andP;  Amultiple port card and terminals were then added.andP;  Each terminal was used tosimulate user tasks at 9,600 baud.andP;  Finally, remote communications at 1,200and 9,600 baud using standard modems were tested, with the system under load.andO;Some systems with TCP/IP, X.25, or other communications interfaces weretested in those environments.andM;All systems included C compilers, so these were tested with a standard suiteof benchmarks, although quantitative benchmarks were not run.andP;  Instead, theirbehavior was observed under varying load conditions, and the compiler'soverall functions noted.andP;  In most cases, applications were tested as part ofthe load simulation.andP;  These included word processors, spreadsheets, anddatabase systems.andM;All systems were installed and tested on a Dell 325 with 8MB RAM, 150MB ESDIdrive, and VGA monitor.andP;  Two multiport boards were used: a 16-port AnvilStallion card and an eight-port DigiBoard.andP;  All systems were tested with anArchive 120MB tape unit for backup storage.andM;SANTA CRUZ OPERATION SCO XENIX 386 v. 2.3.2andM;SCO XENIX arose from a joint technology agreement with Microsoft, whichdeveloped XENIX under license from ATandamp;T The past few years have seenMicrosoft turn its XENIX operating system over to SCO, although Microsoftstill offers some XENIX applications.andP;  The version of SCO XENIX tested herewas the latest release in a long line of improvements.andM;XENIX was intended to provide UNIX capabilities on microcomputers.andP;  Thatremains its primary goal, but XENIX has been refined into an operating systemin its own right-based on UNIX but distinct enough to offer a logicalalternative.andM;The essential differences between UNIX and XENIX lie in their inherent speed:UNIX is by nature a large product; XENIX was designed to reproduce theimportant aspects of UNIX yet maintain a smaller kernel and faster operation,as required by the more limited microprocessors available at the time.andP;  UNIXand XENIX still differ in the implementation of some system features, but thegap has narrowed considerably.andP;  XENIX does not offer the full ATandamp;T standardUNIX but gives a user the majority of UNIX's features in a faster environmentwith different system requirements.andM;SCO XENIX/386 is shipped as a set of three packages, each of which can beobtained separately.andP;  The operating system is part of the run-time system andincludes XENIX and utilities.andP;  The development system includes the compilers,make utilities, and other programming tools and libraries (includinggraphics).andP;  Finally, the text-processing system includes severaltext-formatting programs, including nroff and troff.andM;The XENIX/386 run-time system (referred to here as XENIX/386) consists of thesystem diskettes divided into operating system, basic utilities, advancedutilities, and documentation.andP;  The operating system and basic utilities mustbe installed, but the advanced utilities are optional.andP;  Many can be left out,with only selected packages installed, if desired.andM;The SCO documentation is impressive.andP;  It consists of three binders, eachthree inches wide, and several smaller guides for tutorials and releasenotes, all shipped in a large cardboard box.andP;  The documentation is wellwritten, with most of the material based on the ATandamp;T UNIX documentation.andP;  Theinstallation instructions were completely rewritten by SCO.andP;  The manualsinclude reference guides alphabetically organized by command type, as well asuser and system administrator guides.andM;Installation of XENIX/386 is a matter of booting with one diskette andfollowing on-screen instructions.andP;  The entire process can be automated withassumed system defaults, or each step can be controlled by the user.andP;  Ineither case, the installation routine follows the correct order of commandsautomatically, letting the user specify changes only when needed.andM;Most users will be able to follow the installation without changing anyparameters: after several dozen installations, the only changes we made werethe size of the swap space (for swapping memory to disk, which must beincreased with heavy database use) and the inclusion of a separate user filestructure when large disk sizes and many users are involved.andM;The SCO installation documents guide the user through every step of theinstallation, duplicating the on-screen instructions to a great extent.andO;Whenever changes can be made by the user, instructions are supplied.andO;Formulas for calculating space requirements are included, as are generalguidelines.andM;The installation routine is very simple and can be performed with noknowledge of UNIX or XENIX.andP;  The hardest part of the whole process isswapping diskettes.andP;  XENIX/386 requires a minimum of 1MB RAM, although only alimited amount of work can be done with this amount.andP;  On the test system's8MB, we had no trouble running 16 users with disk swapping of largeapplications.andP;  Disk space varies depending on the options installed, but aworkable minimum would be 20MB of disk, allowing room for swap space and userfiles.andM;XENIX looks very much like UNIX.andP;  The system administrator shows severalchanges, including the system files that contain device information.andP;  Thesechanges are easy to adapt to, and we preferred the XENIX methods over theUNIX equivalents for speed and simplicity of maintenance.andM;Security is maintained the same way as with UNIX: employing passwords andlogin names for access.andP;  Each user can be assigned to a group.andP;  File and userpermissions are identical to UNIX.andM;XENIX commands are identical to UNIX commands, with only insignificantvariations in some flags of command syntaxes.andP;  Adapting to XENIX willcertainly pose no problem for UNIX users, as everything is the same from theuser's point of view.andM;Applications for XENIX abound, and later versions of XENIX/386 will runstandard UNIX applications in many cases.andP;  DOS emulation is supported withthe Interactive System's VP/ix product, which gives a pseudo-DOS capabilityunder XENIX.andP;  DOS partitions can be used within XENIX but can't be writtento.andP;  Instead, a DOS area is allocated within the XENIX partition by VP/ix.andO;The process is slower than DOS but functions well with all the DOSapplications we tested.andM;SCO offers a newsletter that gives product-release information and technicaladvice to all registered users.andP;  In addition, each new system provides 30days of free technical support over the telephone.andP;  After that, supportcontracts must be purchased from SCO on one of several levels.andP;  The best hasone-hour turnaround for answers or information.andM;XENIX/386 is considerably faster than SCO UNIX and requires fewer systemresources.andP;  For those with only 2MB of RAM, for example, UNIX is not a viableoperating system, while XENIX will love that amount.andP;  When performingstraightforward crunching, XENIX is faster than UNIX because of its smalleroverhead.andM;XENIX/386 gives true multiuser capabilities and supports a variety of add-onserial communications cards.andP;  On my test system, we loaded a 16-port AnvilStallion card with terminals and activated timing loops on all ports.andP;  Thesystem purred along with little slowing of any main-console tasks.andM;I've used XENIX/386 for over four years and know it very well.andP;  I've alwaysbeen impressed by its UNIX capabilities, even before the advent of the 80386versions.andP;  Choosing between UNIX and XENIX is a matter of requirements.andP;  Thetwo are close, but XENIX doesn't offer all the standard features of UNIX.andP;  Itdoes function faster and is easier to maintain.andP;  Its wide range of XENIXapplications make it an attractive operating system.andM;Given any machine architecture, XENIX operates faster than UNIX and usesfewer system resources.andP;  It's not UNIX, though, and that's the main problem;it can't run all UNIX-based applications.andP;  However, XENIX has establisheditself as a major operating system for microcomputer multiuser systems, andit's not going to be phased out in favor of UNIX.andM;Given a self-contained system, we would choose XENIX for its power.andP;  AndXENIX/386 is as close to an industry standard as possible in the XENIXmarket.andP;  Coupled with the excellent support SCO offers (albeit at a price),XENIX/386 is an outstanding product.andM;Interactive Systems Corp. Interactive 386/ix v. 2.0.2andM;The Interactive 386/ix system competes with the SCO XENIX/386 and differsfrom it in a few ways.andP;  Its overall functions, as expected, are similar.andM;The Interactive 386/ix system is supplied in a large cardboard box containingseveral smaller slipcase boxes.andP;  The contents depend on whether thedevelopment and text-processing systems are included, but all manuals areshipped in nice slipcase boxes that vary in width up to four inches.andP;  Eachmanual is paperbound, and no three-ring binders are included in the set.andO;While the paperbound manuals are physically more attractive than binders,they crack at the spines.andM;The documentation differs from the XENIX/386 manuals in that some have beenrewritten from the ATandamp;T UNIX manuals.andP;  The basic manuals (user guide, systemadministrator guide, and references) are included, but a few have beendesigned specifically for the Interactive system.andM;Installation is a matter of booting from a disk and following instructions onthe screen.andP;  The installation manual includes all user-definable changes tothe installation process.andM;Interactive 386/ix requires about 1.5MB to function correctly, supportingmore than a simple shell task.andP;  Each user, of course, adds more RAMrequirements.andP;  But on my 8MB test system, Interactive fully supported 16users with load, although some users were swapped to disk during the process.andO;Disk space varies depending on the installation options, but a minimum usablesystem requires about 20MB of space.andM;Interactive 386/ix is compatible with software written for the SCO XENIXsystem and runs some UNIX software without modification.andP;  It posed nocompatibility problems.andP;  Interestingly, some software written for theInteractive system would not run on XENIX 386, so some internal differencesmay be significant if you want to run applications for another environment.andM;The utilities and support programs supplied with Interactive 386/ix are thefamiliar UNIX system commands, some with slight syntax changes or handlingdifferences.andP;  Users will see no difference between the Interactive productand SCO's XENIX or standard UNIX.andP;  The system administrator will notechanges, but these are readily documented and easy to work with.andP;  Thedevelopment and text systems are similar to the UNIX systems and have a Ccompiler, make utility, and various other support programs for developers.andM;Interactive 386/ix can be supplied with the VP/ix system, written byInteractive, that lets DOS programs to be executed within their environment.andO;This program is the same as the one licensed to SCO for its VP/ix product.andO;VP/ix lets you set up a DOS directory tree in the 386/ix file system and runsvirtually all DOS programs from within that area or from a DOS partition onthe disk drive.andP;  VP/ix worked flawlessly when it was properly installed andconfigured.andP;  It worked with all my standard DOS programs except the ones thatdo strange things to DOS interrupts or video BIOS.andP;  Support, supplied bytelephone, was fast and useful.andM;Interactive 386/ix seemed to be a little faster than XENIX/386, but this wasnot tested quantitatively.andP;  The system is internally different, since thekernels are unique for each product, but their functions are very similar.andM;Choosing between XENIX/386 and Interactive 386/ix is difficult.andP;  The SCOproduct and documentation are not as well presented as Interactive's, but wepreferred the three-ring binder approach of the SCO version for accessinginformation (and laying the manual flat on the desk).andP;  Otherwise, the twoproducts appear functionally identical.andP;  Some software is product-sensitive,but we did not try some of the larger SCO products under Interactive 386/ix.andM;Both are excellent products from companies that know XENIX and support it tothe fullest extent.andP;  The final choice will depend on the applications thatmust be run.andM;Santa Cruz Operation SCO UNIX 386 v. 1.0andM;Following its XENIX/386 release, SCO decided to develop a complete UNIXsystem for the 80386 processor.andP;  SCO UNIX, still in its first release, isproviding a completely compatible UNIX product.andM;SCO UNIX is rated as a trusted system (or C2) by the Dept.andP;  of Defense.andP;  Thisprovides for certain safeguards against intrusion, file-system performance,and maintainability.andM;The SCO UNIX package is very similar to the XENIX/386 system, packaged in analmost identical box.andP;  The documentation has changed slightly: two of thebinders from XENIX/386 have been replaced by paperbound books, including theuser and system administrator guides.andP;  The reference manuals remainthree-ring binders.andM;The contents of the system are standard UNIX fare; the SCO writteninstallation and tutorial guides are the primary differences.andP;  Otherwise, thematerial corresponds to ATandamp;T's documentation.andM;You install the system with a boot diskette and a simple installation routinethat can be completely automated.andP;  The installation routine uses a singlemain-system-administrator shell program that automates all tasks the systemadministrator must perform, including setting up the system for terminals,printers, and users.andP;  We found the shell a little slower than manualroutines, but more reliable and easier to learn.andM;SCO UNIX requires a good chunk of RAM.andP;  On our 8MB system it worked fine, butits larger size keeps it from supporting the same number of users as XENIX.andO;It requires a little more disk space than XENIX but can be installed in a20MB system.andP;  With a 4MB RAM system, we found some slowdown when swappingwith more than four users performing database applications.andM;SCO UNIX has all UNIX commands, functions, and features.andP;  Veteran UNIX usersfrom any other environment that ran ATandamp;T standard UNIX will be completely athome with SCO UNIX.andP;  Changes to the system are really enhancements in theform of script files and shell programs for system maintenance, backupcontrol, and other system functions.andP;  These can all be bypassed to give avanilla UNIX, but we found them useful and welcome additions.andM;The increased overhead of complete UNIX functions naturally affectsperformance, and UNIX is slower to execute, boot, and perform most functionsof comparable XENIX systems.andP;  Given more RAM, though, it works quite handily.andM;The version tested is the first release of the product, and we used it fortwo months prior to this review.andP;  During that time, maintenance releases weresent from SCO to correct a few problems.andP;  As with any new release, SCO UNIXwill undergo an aging process where the company will add features and makecorrections to code.andP;  But the problems are few and far between, and normalusers will seldom encounter them.andP;  The support system for SCO UNIX is thesame as for its XENIX/386 product, with maintenance patches available as theyare released.andM;SCO UNIX is a very attractive package for the 80386 market.andP;  Its youthfulnesshas caused a few problems, but these are fixed with maintenance releases.andO;The next release, scheduled for this summer, should solve the first version'sfew teething problems.andP;  SCO's UNIX runs everything a UNIX should.andM;The release of SCO UNIX is an important milestone for the evolution ofIntel-based machines, providing a true UNIX on a microcomputer.andP;  Itinterfaces perfectly with larger UNIXs and won't offer any surprises toveteran UNIX users.andP;  Perhaps its greatest accolade is that no one will besurprised by SCO UNIX.andP;  Finally, true UNIX on the PC !andP;  QUANTUM SOFTWARESYSTEMS LTD. QNX v. 2.15EandM;QNX was conceived and developed as an alternative to larger multiuser,multitasking software.andP;  It offers an operating system with many featuressimilar to UNIX in a small, fast kernel.andM;QNX was not planned as a variation of UNIX but was designed to offer analternative in terms of performance, task support, and functions.andP;  While itis still a relatively small product compared to the rest of the UNIX world, agrowing number of dedicated programmers believe QNX is a viable, efficientoperating system.andP;  QNX offers a subset of the UNIX commands.andP;  It does notrival UNIX for features or flexibility, but offers features that UNIX cannot.andM;Although not intended to compete with UNIX, QNX inevitably has to suffercomparison, especially since its name implies that it is a variant.andP;  QNX is atrue multiuser, multitasking system that supports DOS backward compatibility.andO;It operates on networks and stand-alone machines with equal ease and can beused for a full multiuser system supporting terminals, externalcommunications, and a wide variety of industry-standard communicationssystems.andM;QNX's primary advantage is the compactness and speed of its kernel operation.andO;The operating system runs to only 148K (the kernel is about 10K) and, on an80286 or 80386 system that's not under heavy load, can quite easily functionas a real-time system.andP;  Many QNX applications rely on this speed and offeron-line transaction processing and system monitoring in multitask mode.andM;Network support is via Arcnet LANs.andP;  Since QNX is designed around amessage-passing architecture, network support comes to it quite naturally.andO;Indeed, on a network that is properly set up, QNX offers far betterperformance than any DOS-based network and rivals UNIX on a large system.andM;The QNX system is provided on three high-density diskettes (one for the Ccompiler) or six standard diskettes (two for the compiler).andP;  It can run onany Intel 8088-based system, even old PCs, but it really shines on the newer80286 and 80386 processors.andM;QNX's documentation is supplied in two three-ring binders: the first is theoperating system manual and the second is for the compiler.andP;  The operatingsystem manual is divided into a description of the system and itsinstallation, utilities (an alphabetical reference), the full-screen editorQNX employs, and technical notes.andP;  The manual is well presented, but wethought the material was rather briefly covered.andP;  The utilities reference isvery good, providing examples and lengthy description of the QNX commands.andM;The C compiler manual is only for reference.andP;  No attempt is made to teach Cor cover the use of the compiler to any great extent.andP;  The manual could usebetter introductory material and perhaps a more friendly tone.andM;Installing QNX involves booting with a QNX boot disk and followinginstructions.andP;  The two methods for installing QNX are fully automatic andmanual.andP;  The automatic version lets new QNX users install the operatingsystem without understanding many of its intricacies.andP;  The manual routinelets users maintain total control over the installation and operatingenvironment parameters.andM;When you start QNX with a boot diskette, it displays the login message, andthe automatic installation is started with the QNX install command afterlogging in as the superuser.andP;  You invoke manual installation by issuing theinstallation commands singly at the superuser prompt.andP;  The installationcommands differ considerably from those used in UNIX/XENIX, but the generalprocedure is similar.andP;  If QNX is to share a hard disk with DOS, you shouldinstall the DOS partition first.andP;  All commands in QNX offer help if thecommand name is followed by a question mark.andP;  QNX is shipped as two versions:one that operates in real mode and another that uses protected mode to allowaccess to up to 15MB of memory.andM;Many QNX commands are similar to UNIX.andP;  The file directory structure uses thesame layout as UNIX, but some command changes are used.andP;  DOS users shouldfind the conversion to QNX easier than UNIX users.andP;  For example, directorymovement commands that use a period in UNIX use up arrows in QNX.andP;  Thedirectory command DIR actually draws a graphical representation of thefile-tree structure on the terminal.andP;  Each directory can contain up to 32,000files.andM;QNX stores files as randomly addressable sequences, without rigid layoutstructures.andP;  A QNX file can be up to a terabyte in length or (morerealistically) limited by the size of the hard disks.andM;QNX addresses drives as numbers.andP;  The hard disk, for example, is usually 3:,while the floppy is 1:, analogous to DOS's C: and A: and certainly easierthan UNIX's /dev/fd0 format.andM;QNX does a good job of supporting multitasking.andP;  Each task (which can bestarted by any user on any terminal in a network) can be assigned a priorityfor processing order.andP;  QNX supports multiple virtual terminals, up to eightper console.andP;  They are toggled with a Ctrl-Alt sequence, and each console istreated as a separate session.andP;  For those who are used to UNIX-or DOS-basedmultitasking systems like VM386, this is not novel, but it sure is impressiveusing eight virtual sessions on an antiquated XT !andP;  Security consists ofusing a login name and password, although the password file is not encrypted.andO;All users and devices are assigned numbers and may be placed in groups thatare allowed specific permissions.andP;  A user is assigned a rank from zero to 255within a group, with 255 the top (or administrator) level.andP;  Groups are rankedwithin a supergroup layout.andP;  While simplistic, this method works well formost uses.andM;QNX uses a message-switching system that supports messages (sequences) of upto 64K that are set from task to task.andP;  Message forwarding is inherent in theQNX kernel, providing extremely fast performance.andP;  QNX operates on a16-level, prioritized time-slice method that supports pre-emptions.andM;Quantum Software supports its users with a variety of programs and services.andO;All registered users receive a quarterly newsletter.andP;  A dial-in systemsupporting regular modem communications and X.25 provides downloads ofprogram updates and fixes.andP;  A third-party vendor catalog is available.andM;Although we did not plan to perform benchmarks of the operating systems weexamined, we were so curious about QNX's performance that we had to make aquick comparison.andP;  Running on our reference machine (a Dell 325), QNXoutperformed XENIX/386 and SCO UNIX by a small margin in some tests but fella little short in others.andM;When I/O benchmarks were used for opening, closing, reading, and writingfiles, QNX ran a little faster than XENIX and UNIX in file operations.andP;  Thespeed difference varied with the load on the system, with QNX slowing downbelow UNIX and XENIX when heavy task loads were used.andP;  In most cases, thedifference was not significant.andM;A Dhrystone benchmark was compiled with the QNX C compiler and the C compilerfrom the SCO XENIX/386 development system.andP;  The Dhrystone benchmark testspure compilation speed and efficiency.andP;  The XENIX program outperformed theQNX system by double, although this margin was reduced by half using the QNXversion of the Computer Innovations C86 compiler.andP;  The XENIX system stillgave a 25% speed increase over the QNX optimized program.andP;  This may be due tothe internal 32-bit nature of XENIX versus the 16-bit nature of QNX, but itis more likely a result of the better use of the 80286/80386 instruction setin the XENIX product, while QNX maintains 8088 compatibility.andP;  (A 32-bit QNXthat is POSIX compatible is due for release soon.)andM;Task switching is definitely faster in QNX than either UNIX or XENIX.andP;  Insome cases, we observed a qualitative result of just under 9,000 taskswitches per second.andP;  This was a strong factor when we compared QNX'sperformance on a network.andP;  On a nine-node network (nine 80286 PCs and an80386 server with 8MB RAM and 300MB hard disk), QNX outperformed both 3Com'sand Novell's DOS networking systems considerably.andP;  Quantitative tests werenot possible since the network was available for only a short amount of time.andO;Regardless, the network manager was so impressed by QNX that he is seriouslyconsidering switching his DOS application base to QNX.andP;  A better accoladecannot be made.andM;QNX is a curious product for those accustomed to both the DOS and UNIXworlds.andP;  While really compatible with neither (aside from some DOS-emulationcapabilities that will improve with the next release), QNX has a growingcollection of third-party software.andP;  It is also rapidly expanding its owncapabilities, and the 32-bit version should show considerable performanceincreases over the UNIX and XENIX products tested here.andP;  Its integration withTCP/IP and other communications protocols indicates that it is quicklybecoming a very serious alternative operating system.andM;QNX was not difficult to learn or use, but familiarity will definitely showits functions much better than our short appraisal can.andP;  We worked inconjunction with several QNX programmers, and they were effusive in theirpraise for the system.andP;  We remain a little disappointed in the performance ofthe C compiler, and the benchmarks do not do justice to QNX's capabilities.andM;For those who do not want (or need) full-blown UNIX/XENIX, QNX is a productvery worthy of attention.andP;  For programmers looking for an environment forreal-time applications, this just may be the best around.andM;Not half-bakedandM;SCO UNIX is the first true UNIX for 80386 machines, and as such is a logicalchoice.andP;  Interactive's 386/ix system is about as close as it can get withoutbeing UNIX and compares very favorably with SCO XENIX/386.andP;  Choosing betweenthese two is tough.andP;  Documentation and support gives it to SCO, but pureperformance goes to Interactive.andM;QNX is an interesting alternative for those who do not need UNIX or XENIX inits entirety or are looking for a real-time system.andM;The four products reviewed show the level of sophistication available for the80386-based machinery.andP;  Although many other versions of UNIX and XENIX arebeing ported, these four are the ones against which all others must becompared.andM;Tim Parker is the UNIX editor for COMPUTER LANGUAGE.andM;A LOT OF UNIX AND A LITTLE XENIXandM;SCO XENIX 386 v. 2.3.2: $695 SCO UNIX 386 v. 1.0: $695 Santa Cruz Operations400 Encinal Rd.
