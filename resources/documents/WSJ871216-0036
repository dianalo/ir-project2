Along with the resolution of the labor crisis, the government announced a package of measures to try to stabilize Mexico's reeling economy.    Under the agreement, workers will receive an immediate 15% pay increase and those earning the minimum wage will receive an additional 20% raise in January. The government also said it would index subsequent wage increases to the prices of consumer goods until there is a substantial decline in the country's surging 143% annual inflation.    Early yesterday, Fidel Velazquez, Mexico's aged labor leader, expressed disappointment with the wage agreement, which was far below the 46% pay increase retroactive to November that labor had demanded. &quot;I hope not to lose credibility with the bases,&quot; he said to reporters. Originally, the government had said it would announce a resolution to the labor crisis last Monday. The delay seemed to indicate that labor was trying to drive a harder bargain than expected.    In a nationally televised address late last night President Miguel de la Madrid said that the new economic program was one that was &quot;bitter, painful, that involves sacrifices for all.&quot;    The government said that by reducing public-sector spending, maintaining controls on certain basic foodstuffs and proceeding with the previously announced reduction in barriers to imports, the government hoped to cut inflation to approximately half of this year's level.    Mexican workers have been remarkably compliant while real wages have been more than halved in the past five years, but Mr. Velazquez lately has expressed increasing irritation with government economic policy. &quot;I think Fidel Velazquez is trying to tell the government that he is now moving along the brink in his relations with the state,&quot; said Adolfo Aguilar, a Mexican academic who is currently a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington.    But Mexican leaders still face a considerable challenge in allaying the bitterness provoked by the government's management of events up to and following the 18% devaluation of the primary, or controlled, peso on Monday. The difficulties began when the Mexican stock market plunged in October, triggering a spate of capital flight and a drain on Mexico's currency reserves. Last month, when the central bank moved to preserve its reserves by withdrawing its support for the peso on the secondary, or free, exchange market, it had evidently expected the free peso to gradually recover some of its value against the primary, controlled peso. Instead, the free peso continued to linger about 25% below the controlled peso.    That made it inevitable that the government had to close the gap by also devaluing the controlled peso -- doubling the psychological blow to Mexicans. Yesterday, there was strong demand for dollars at currency exchange houses, a sign that moneyed Mexicans are worried. And some merchants, confused about the intricacies of Mexico's dual exchange-rate system, began marking up merchandise for the second time in less than a month.    &quot;The Mexican economy is reaching the dangerous point where technical measures no longer function and psychological dynamics take over,&quot; said M. Delal Baer, fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington.    The government's failure to come forth promptly with an explanation of its actions has made a bad situation worse. In announcing the devaluation of the controlled peso Monday morning, the central bank said that step was part of a package of new economic measures to be made public later that day. But the next government statement, late Monday night, said that the new economic program would be unveiled yesterday.    In the meantime, the absence of hard information unleashed a torrent of worrisome and false rumors that the government would take steps even more drastic than those it has chosen.    ---   World Bank Loan to Chile   Special to The Wall Street Journal    WASHINGTON -- World Bank executive directors approved a $250 million loan to Chile to support trade liberalization measures and other economic reforms.    The U.S., along with some other countries, refused to support the loan and abstained in the executive board's voting because of alleged human-rights abuses by Chile's government. The opposition group also included several Scandinavian countries and some other Latin American members of the World Bank, according to participants in the board meeting.    The bank intends to announce details of the loan later. The loan will be the third such structural economic adjustment loan the 151-nation international agency has made to Chile. Two earlier loans, each amounting to $250 million, have been fully used by the Chilean government, according to World Bank sources. </TEXT></DOC>
