The health-care and cleaning-services concern, which started its own maid-service business last fall, said the acquisition marks its major initiative to penetrate the home-services industry, a market estimated at $10 billion.    The company said terms of the purchase include a provision for the management of Merry Maids to participate in a minority portion of the ownership of the newly formed Merry Maids partnership, with the founder remaining active in management of the operation.    ServiceMaster said Merry Maid consists of 370 franchises in 44 states. Revenue of all Merry Maids franchises is estimated at $38 million, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
