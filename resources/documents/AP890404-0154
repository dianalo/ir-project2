Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha wrote U.N. Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cueller on Tuesday that South Africa wasconsidering suspending the implementation of independence in theterritory.   ``Unless active and effective measures are taken within the nextfew hours to stem the rapid deterioration of the situation, thewhole peace process in Namibia is in danger of collapse,'' said hisletter, released in South Africa.   At least 169 guerrillas, 19 police and one South African soldierhave been killed since Saturday in clashes across Namibia'snorthern border with Angola, according to police and militaryofficials.   South Africa accused Sam Nujoma, leader of the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization, of sending 1,200 SWAPO guerrillas fromsouthern Angola into northern Namibia in a deliberate attempt tosabotage the peace process.   A U.N. investigation found the guerrillas had launched a ``majorincursion'' from Angola in violation of the peace plan, accordingto diplomats in New York who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   The United States on Tuesday urged SWAPO guerrillas to pull backinto Angola and allow the Namibian independence process to getunder way.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Washingtondoes not think the agreement was in danger of unraveling ``at thispoint.''   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also condemned what shecalled a rebel incursion into Namibia and said the incursion causedthe fighting.   Botha wrote, ``The South African government cannot be expectedto implement its undertakings ... while SWAPO continues to act inflagrant violation of the provisions'' approved by the UnitedNations.   Under the U.N. plan, all SWAPO guerrillas are to remain at theirbases in Angola at least 100 miles north of Namibia's border untilmid-May.   Botha said 4,450 SWAPO fighters now are south of that line. Healso said hundreds of Cuban troops in Angola, in tandem with SWAPOfighters, had moved to within 650 yards of the Namibian border.   ``In such circumstances, South Africa has the undoubted right tosuspend its compliance with its obligations,'' Botha's letter added.   Fighting broke out Saturday, the day the United Nations begansupervising a yearlong independence plan for the territory thatSouth Africa has controlled for 74 years.   South African military officials say the fighting is theheaviest since the 1966 start of the bush war against SWAPO.   South African Broadcasting Corp. television showed bodies ofmore than a dozen guerrillas killed in one clash. Journaliststoured northern Namibia and saw evidence of heavy fighting, butcasualty figures could not be independently confirmed.   Nujoma and other SWAPO officials say the guerrillas were inNamibia for some time and that South African-led forces initiatedthe fighting.   ``Our people have been fighting inside Namibia in the past 20years,'' Nujoma told reporters after meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe,with representatives from the the five permanent member nations ofthe U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Britain, France,China and the Soviet Union.   Nujoma said he planned to end two decades of exile and return toNamibia ``very soon.'' He asked the United Nations to bolster itscease-fire monitoring forces in northern Namibia.   The United Nations authorized 4,650 troops for the Namibiaoperation, but only about 1,000 have arrived and no more than 300are in northern Namibia. The U.N. forces made no effort tointervene in the fighting and say it is not part of their mandate.   Perez de Cuellar said Monday in New York the fighting did notmean U.N. peacekeeping efforts had broken down.   The U.N.'s special representative to Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari,traveled Tuesday from the capital of Windhoek to the war zone.   The Namibian territorial police force, composed mostly of blackNamibians commanded by white South Africans, has done most of thefighting against the guerrillas. The makeup of the territorial armyis similar. The South African army units in Namibia are virtuallyall-white.   About 1,500 South African and Namibian soldiers, belonging tothe territorial army and the South African army, were given U.N.permission to leave their bases and support the police.   ``Our people are being butchered under the United Nationsflag,'' SWAPO Foreign Secretary Theo-Ben Gurirab said Tuesday inNew York.   South Africa has ruled Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,since World War I, when it took control of the former German colony.   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December whenSouth Africa, Angola and Cuba signed a peace accord that calls forwithdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting Marxist Angola.Besides granting Namibia independence, South Africa is to endmilitary aid to right-wing rebels in Angola.   Under the U.N. plan, elections are to be held in Namibia inNovember, leading to independence early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
