Ricciardone.andM;Progress runs on Unix, VMS, MS-DOS, OS/2 and CTOS/BTOS, as well as TCP/IP,DECnet, NetBIOS and SPX/IPX communication protocols.andM;Version 6 is available immediately for many Progress platforms, includingHewlett-Packard CO.'s 9000 Series 800, VMS, MS-DOS, SCO Xenix and Unix fromthe Santa Cruz Operation Inc., Symmetry from Sequent Computer systems Inc.andO;and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Sun-4 and Sparc machines, among others.andP;  Version6 will be available on other hardware systems later this year, Ricciardonesaid.andM;The open architecture of Version 6 supports ANSI-standard Structured QueryLanguage and includes a dynamic SQL interface, Ricciardone said.andP;  He saiddynamic SQL provides an open interface to the Progress database that allowsdevelopers of other tools such as spreadsheets, CASE products and wordprocessing packages to use those tools with Progress.andM;C applications developers can run existing and new C programs against aProgress database using embedded SQL statements in the new version,Ricciardone said.andM;The new version includes distributed database support allowing users toconnect up to 240 databases simultaneously.andM;Version 6 has a new data dictionary setup so that each user has his own datadictionary and does not need to rely on any single database server to routerequests.andP;  It lets users import and export data to many spreadsheet and wordprocessing packages.andM;Other Progress Version 6 enhancements include read-only database support, anincrease in the number of users per database and a DOS memory saver.andM;Brian L. Astle, Progress' director of federal marketing, said Progress is setapart from other relational database management systems in the eyes offederal users.andM;&quot;From our experience, the primary differences that government users see in usas opposed to others is that you can do the whole application in afourth-generation language,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You don't have to drop down to athird-generation language.&quot;andM;Astle said Progress now has about two dozen major government users.andM;The Defense Intelligence Agency has all of its non-mainframe intelligencedatabases based on Progress, he said.andP;  DIA has a Progress database on a localarea network with critical intelligence information about the Soviet Union,Grenada, North Korea and China, Astle said.andM;The Drug Enforcement Agency uses Progress to track assets captured in drugbusts from capture to sale, he said.andM;The Navy uses the system for message handling and tracking.andP;  The systemreceives messages via Progress on board ships so that officers can scanmessages received from specified areas at any time, Astle said.andM;Other government users include the Health and Human Services Department'sCenters for Disease Control, which stores survey results in a Progressdatabase, and the U.S.andP;  Mint in Philadelphia, which uses Progress to helpmonitor coin stampjing machines.andM;Government users who want to try the package can contact Progress for a testversion.andP;  The system will work for 10 sessions before disabling itself, Astlesaid.andM;The cost ranges from $1,200 to $158,000 on the GSA schedule for thedevelopment system depending on hardware and operating system.andM;Contact Brian Astle of Progress, tel.andP;  703-351-5270.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
