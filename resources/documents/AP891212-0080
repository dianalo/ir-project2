If granted, the waiver would be a further softening of U.S.sanctions imposed against China after the June massacre of hundredsof pro-democracy advocates.   The White House confirmed on Monday that Chinese engineers havebeen allowed to return to work in the United States on a $500million program to upgrade Chinese F-8 fighter planes withsophisticated electronics equipment.   The Bush administration also has renewed U.S. subsidies forgrain sales to Beijing.   On Dec. 5, the Agriculture Department announced that China wouldbe eligible to buy an additional one million metric tons of wheatusing Export Enhancement Program subsidies.   The announcement came as the Chinese had used up almost all oftheir previous EEP allocation, a two-million-ton promise that hadbeen made when President Bush visited China last February. Nearlyhalf the sales under that allocation have been made since theTiananmen Square massacre, with a subsidy value of more than $11million.   Explaining the pending decision on the satellites, Fitzwatersaid Bush's freeze on sales of military weapons and defensearticles was not intended to disrupt normal commercial relations.   Referring to the satellites, Fitzwater said, ``We recognize thatsome items captured in the suspension here have civilianapplications and fall in the category of normal commercialexports.''   Two of the satellites are being built by the Hughes Aircraft Co.in a joint project with Australia. The third satellite is beingrefurbished by Hughes for AsiaSat, a British-Chinese consortium.   Fitzwater said he was not aware of any softening in the U.S.opposition to granting World Bank loans to China.   Bush said China's record of human rights abuses are not abarrier to better relations with the United States.   ``We have contacts with countries that have egregious records onhuman rights,'' Bush said Monday, explaining his decision to send ahigh-level delegation to Beijing seeking ``new impetus and vigor''in Sino-U.S. relations.   He pledged to ``keep looking for ways to find common ground.''   ``Generally speaking, I realize the difficulty of thisrelationship but I don't want to make it any worse,'' Bush said.``I'd like to think it would improve.''   He said, however, his initiative had not produced ``totalnormalization'' of relations and that an array of sanctions remainin place.   Meanwhile, the sponsor of legislation permitting Chinesestudents to remain in the United States if they fear retaliation athome said Congress will attempt to override Bush's veto as soon asit reconvenes next month.   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she has received assurancesthe veto override attempt will receive top priority from House andSenate leaders.   ``I think we have enough (votes) to override,'' she told a newsconference, saying she is receiving commitments from both Democratsand Republicans.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell condemned the U.S.overture to Beijing as ``embarrassing kowtowing to the Chinesegovernment.''   Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``The administration supports humanrights in its words. It does not do so in its deeds. ... Theseactions make a mockery of our profession of concern for humanrights and are inconsistent with our stated ideals.''   Bush defended his action during a meeting with newspapereditorial page editors.   Elsewhere on the foreign policy front, the president said hewould do nothing to force the issue of German reunification.   ``It's too sensitive and it's not the role for the United Statesto do that,'' Bush said, suggesting the day has long passed wheneither the U.S. president or the Soviet leader had a role on theissue of European boundaries.   He underscored his hope that a drug summit can be held nextFebruary in Colombia, despite recent violence there, saying hewanted no part of sending a signal that Colombian PresidentVirgilio Barco ``cannot provide the proper security.''   Bush also said the United States does not favor any step thatwould force Israel to be ``pressured into negotiating'' with thePalestine Liberation Organization, despite Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III's efforts to help formulate a way to get Middle Eastpeace talks going.   Bush met with the editors after receiving a briefing from BrentScowcroft, his national security adviser, who returned Monday froma weekend visit to Beijing. He was accompanied on the trip byLawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state.   The trip represented an about-face in U.S. demands that Chinatake the first step to repair the breach in relations. For itspart, China had bitterly rejected the U.S. criticism and a seriesof American sanctions as amounting to interference in its internalaffairs.</TEXT></DOC>
