FDS WNEWS LTD IINCRETAILING (RET) </IN><DATELINE> CINCINNATI  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman and chief executive officer of Federated Department Stores Inc.'s I. Magnin division resigned, raising anew questions about the future of the San Francisco-based specialty department store unit.    Steven M. Somers, 47 years old, resigned after eight years as a top officer with I. Magnin, a division of the diversified retailer that has had problems for several years. I. Magnin has been only marginally profitable, according to retail industry sources, with very &quot;soft&quot; business in the highly competitive California market.    There have been repeated rumors in the last year that Federated might sell the division and, recently, that Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Inc. may be interested in buying it.    I. Magnin had sales of $319 million for the fiscal year ended Feb. 1. The company operates about 25 stores, most of them in California. In addition to I. Magnin, Federated also operates such divisions as Bloomingdale's, Bullock's, Rich's, and Filene's.    Although Mr. Somers said he told Federated about his departure some time ago, Federated hasn't yet named a successor. And though Mr. Somers said he had &quot;a very good relationship&quot; with Federated, and that the company offered him several positions to stay, he also added, &quot;Maybe my leaving will wake them up.&quot; He said that the company &quot;could have done more to support Magnin's&quot; and that top executives of Federated need to decide on their level of commitment to I. Magnin.    However, he added that I. Magnin's could have performed better to meet &quot;challenges&quot; set it by Federated executives, and noted that Federated had agreed to Mr. Somers's budget requests for capital in the coming fiscal year.    Mr. Somers said, &quot;I'm not in a position to say&quot; whether Federated definitely plans to continue running the Magnin division. A Federated spokesman wouldn't comment on whether the company is committed to keeping the unit. Limited officials couldn't be reached for comment.    However, one source close to the companies said he wouldn't rule out the possibility of Limited buying I. Magnin. Limited Chairman Leslie H. Wexner has said he is interested in operating a specialty department store. Limited operates such stores as Limited, Limited Express, Lane Bryant, Henri Bendel and Victoria's Secret.    Mr. Somers resigned effective Feb. 1, and will become president and chief operating officer of Initials+ Inc., a San Francisco-based retailer that started business in October and went public in November. Mr. Somers bought 54,000 shares in the company, which sells mostly gift items through an approach that blends direct-sales and catalog methods. He said he has taken a substantial cut in salary and benefits to leave Federated because he is eager to pursue a &quot;fast-tracking entrepreneurial&quot; retailing opportunity. Initials+ has 1.9 million shares outstanding.    In a statement, Initials+ noted that Mr. Somers's eight-year tenure as the head of I. Magnin was &quot;tantamount to a record&quot; in California retailing, where turnover is substantial. </TEXT></DOC>
