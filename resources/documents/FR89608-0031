Description of Project: </T3>The Wisconsin Power Company (WPC),licensee for the Petenwell_Castel Rock Project, requests authorizationto convey easements over or sell certain project land. The proposed conveyanceconsists of eight easements over 100andmin16; buffer strip (abutting theproject water) and three fee simple sales of project land. All parcelswould be used for recreational use of and or access to the water. Portionsof the easement land would be designated for private use by residents ofhousing developments to be built adjacent to the buffer strip (upland ofproject land), while other portions of the easement land would be designatedfor public use. The portions designated for public use would be designatedfor trail walking, bank fishing, and in some cases swimming at enhancedbeach areas.Regarding the three parcels to be sold (fee simple), the public would notbe permitted to use these parcels.In total, about 6.5 miles of shoreline would be involved in the conveyanceproposal, of which 2.2 miles would be sold to a private entity. The conveyancesof project land and associated development of non-project land are proposedto occur in stages between the year 1989 and 1994.<T3>l.
