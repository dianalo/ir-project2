Greenberger and John Walcott (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MDEST </CO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iran's recent military and economic setbacks are reviving a heated debate within the Reagan administration over whether to reach out to so-called pragmatists in Tehran in the hope of rebuilding relations with the strategic Persian Gulf nation.    There is broad agreement among U.S. analysts that nearly a decade after Iran's revolution, a growing number of its officials see their nation at a crossroads. Within the past two months, Iran's troops have been routed from pockets of Iraqi territory they have occupied, in some cases for several years. And its economy, long plagued by shortages, high unemployment and falling oil prices, has reached a critical low point. Iran, which long shunned borrowing, now faces a growing debt.    While some experts on Iran argue that all these problems are leading Iran to shift its focus from external aggression to internal revival, some U.S. officials warn against drawing sweeping conclusions about changes in Iran's policies.    Those U.S. officials favoring new diplomatic moves argue that Iran is ready to turn its attention to ensuring the survival of its Islamic revolution by improving its economy and focusing less on international terrorism and the war with Iraq. Wynfred Joshua of the Defense Intelligence Agency says that if the U.S. doesn't seize the opportunity to engage the Iranians, the Soviet Union will fill the void.    But others, who sources say include Secretary of State George Shultz, and several senior officials, view such arguments with a disquieting sense of deja vu. In May 1985, Graham Fuller, then the intelligence community's senior Mideast analyst, wrote a memo predicting Ayatollah Khomeini's regime was faltering and urging a U.S. initiative; the result was the ill-fated secret arms sale to Iran that resulted in a debilitating scandal for the administration.    This time, skeptical U.S. officials want to see concrete signs of Iranian moderation before even considering new U.S. moves. One such test could come next month, during the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Because of Iranian-inspired rioting last year, Saudi Arabia recently said it would limit to about 50,000 the number of Iranian pilgrims it would permit to enter Mecca. Tehran's response could demonstrate whether it wishes to improve relations with Riyadh and other Arab states.    Other policy makers say Washington won't respond to any Iranian peace feelers while Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorists still are holding nine U.S. hostages.    Moreover, a senior official involved in Mideast policy believes that even the military and economic forces buffeting Tehran won't produce a major policy shift until the 88-year-old Ayatollah Khomeini passes from the scene. &quot;As long as he's there, nobody will abandon the ayatollah's basic tenets of winning the war, confronting the 'Great Satan' (the U.S.), confronting communism and being the great defender of Islam,&quot; he says.    But Gary Sick, a member of President Carter's National Security Council and author of a book on Iran's revolution, contends that Iran has decided that its war against Iraq isn't winnable. He also says the U.S. is missing an opportunity by hesitating to probe for a diplomatic opening.    Mr. Sick says the U.S. has difficulty dealing with Iran because it represents a &quot;political trauma&quot; for the U.S. He says the Reagan administration favors Iraq because it views Iran through the prism of three negative events: the Iranian revolution, which displaced a pro-American regime; the 1979-80 hostage crisis, which was a yearlong humiliation for Washington, and the Iran-Contra scandal.    Mr. Sick faults the U.S. for putting more effort into seeking a United Nations arms embargo against Iran than it has put into coaxing both sides toward a cease-fire. U.S. officials assert that their policy is even-handed, calling for an end to the war &quot;without victor or vanquished.&quot; One senior official does worry privately, however, that given their country's recent successes on the battlefield, Iraqis aren't &quot;in a mood to play diplomatic games.&quot;    Adding to the U.S.'s uncertainty are continuing doubts about whether there really are any &quot;pragmatists&quot; in the Iranian government with whom Washington can deal. For instance, some believe Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Parliament, is a pragmatist; they believe his appointment as supreme commander of Iran's armed forces was designed to end the conflict with Iraq. But others question whether he really is a pragmatist, and speculate that the appointment may have been motivated more to reverse battlefield defeats by uniting the army and the more radical Revolutionary Guard Corps.    And, if Mr. Rafsanjani's supposedly moderate political star seems to be rising, U.S. analysts say, so does that of Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami-Pur, a founder of Iran's terror network who presided over this spring's parliamentary elections. </TEXT></DOC>
