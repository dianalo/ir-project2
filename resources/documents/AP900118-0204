Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said the additional troops werenecessary to maintain order and possibly enforce a curfew _ ameasure authorities in the republic of Azerbaijan have refused toimpose despite reports of vicious attacks by Azerbaijani extremistson Armenian residents.   At least 10,500 Armenians reportedly have been evacuated fromthe Azerbaijani capital of Baku, where rampaging Azerbaijani mobsbegan the violence Saturday.   Extremists have obtained heavy weaponry, including helicopters,tanks and ground-to-ground missiles in what Interior Minster VadimBakatin on Thursday called a ``civil war.''   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov told ABC-TV's ``Prime Time Live''early Friday that ``the number of people killed as compared toSaturday and Sunday is now decreasing, in fact almost none.However, the mood among a certain part of the population is stillvery tense.''   In his first public comments since the Baku riots, PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev defended the Kremlin's decision Monday todeclare a state of emergency but said the ethnic problems date backcenturies.   ``The problems, which have been accumulating for tens, no, forhundreds of years, have erupted and acquired the character we arenow confronted with in the Baltics, Moldavia and now in such formsthis interethnic strife are going on in Transcaucasia, inAzerbaijan and Armenia,'' he told a meeting in Moscow.   ``We are now busy trying to halt this process, to prevent itfrom going deeper and getting more acute,'' Gorbachev said incomments broadcast on state radio. ``We have resorted to the use offorce against criminals, against this vandalism.''   It was not clear whether the Kremlin intended to impose thecurfew in Baku and other parts of Azerbaijan, or if Yazov expectedthe Azerbaijani authorities to do it.   Members of the Azerbaijani People's Front said Thursday they hadwarned Moscow that if a curfew or martial law were imposed on Bakuthey would launch a general strike in the strategic oil center.   On Wednesday, the 29,000 troops already in Azerbaijan and therepublic of Armenia were authorized to shoot if necessary to stopthe bitter fighting in the hills around the disputed territory ofNagorno-Karabakh, according to Soviet media.   Foreign reporters were barred from travel to the republics.   In Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian enclave insideAzerbaijan, officials expanded an existing curfew by two hoursThursday, said Tass, the official Soviet news agency.   The military commandant in Nagorno-Karabakh also orderedunregistered organizations dissolved, Tass said.   Yevgeny Primakov, a top-ranking Soviet legislator, confronted amass anti-government demonstration outside the AzerbaijaniCommunist Party headquarters in Baku and said the riots had tostop. The demonstrators called for the liquidation of Soviet powerin Azerbaijan and the resignation of the Azerbaijani leadership,reported Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow.   Soviet authorities sent 5,000 army troops into AzerbaijanTuesday. Interfax said Thursday there are also 24,000 InteriorMinistry troops in the two southern republics 1,250 miles southeastof Moscow.   Extremists in Azerbaijan have blockaded highways, interruptingthe movement of troops and halted 136 freight trains, includingthree carrying military equipment, Interfax said.   Yerevan, the Armenian capital, was reported to be running out offuel because of the Azerbaijani blockade. Armenians countered witha blockade of Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave inside Armenia,Interfax said.   Yazov said more troops were needed because the area was so largeand ``the people in literally all towns and all populated areashave been roused by these events,'' according to Radio Moscow.   Yazov did not specify how many reserve soldiers had been calledup. He said men were being called up from ``neighboring regions,''but did not specify. Tass said the men had recently completed theircompulsory military service.   Yazov said he understood reservists would be unhappy about hismove but emphasized that they are not going with ``the task ofkilling, shooting, going onto some offensive. It is principally toprotect public order.''   He said the reservist call-up was needed in part because recentcuts under Gorbachev's plan to slash the nation's armed forces by500,000 men have depleted the forces that can be moved to theCaucasus.   Extremists besieged the Interior Ministry department in the townof Masali for two hours, Interfax reported.   ``Hundreds of trucks with Armenian militants patrol the border''with the Lachin and Kubaltin regions of Azerbaijan, Interfax said,and troops have been reinforced.   Interfax also said thousands also rallied in Nakhichevan onWednesday to protest plans to rebuild border defenses and stringbarbed wire along the middle of the Araks River, the border withIran.   Hundreds of Azerbaijanis have crossed the river illegally inrecent weeks to visit relatives and demand removal of the borderbarriers.   Detailing the difficulties facing units sent to the Caucasus,Radio Moscow said one transport plane arriving with troops had beenimmediately seized by Armenians fleeing the fighting who demandedto be flown to safety.   Pickets continued at two military airfields in Azerbaijan andattempts were made in Baku to block streets, Interior Ministryspokesman Dmitri Seleznev said.   He said the death toll in the ethnic bloodshed was up to 66 fromthe 58 reported Wednesday, and that 220 people had been wounded.   In the past 24 hours, he said, 4,658 more Armenians had beenevacuated from Baku and 45 ethnically motivated attacks werereported there.   In the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan, 3,000 Armeniansblockaded the village of Kerki, defended by 30 residents who wereaided by 50 soldiers, Seleznev said. He said there had beenshooting but no deaths.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev dispelled rumors theSoviet borders with Iran and Turkey had been sealed, saying that asfar as he knew the border zone but had not been totally shut.Tehran media reported that hundreds of people were crossing intoSoviet territory from Iran.   In Armenia, the Interior Ministry official said, peoplecontinued attacks on armories to steal weapons. During the 24-hourperiod, 198 more weapons were seized including four armored carsand a T-34 tank.</TEXT></DOC>
