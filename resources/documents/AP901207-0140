(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who thought she won $25,000in a Coca-Cola USA contest said she was heartbroken to see herexpected windfall vanish after being told her entry was invalid.   Cheryl Hoch, 43, of Traverse City, is one of four people inMichigan who thought they won $25,000 grand prizes in the Diet CokeSuper Bowl contest.   They each claim to have collected all five game pieces frombottle caps and cardboard packages. But officials of the soft drinkcompany say all of the players' game pieces are not the real thing.   Hoch met Thursday with representatives from Coca-Cola and D.L.Blair Corp., the Nebraska company that judged the contest. Therepresentatives tried to explain to her why she had not won.   ``I'm not convinced,'' she said after the meeting.   Coca-Cola spokesman Bob Bertini said the dispute centers aroundgame pieces marked ``XXII,'' of which only five were printed. Hesaid the XXII pieces the would-be winners had were not authentic.   ``There, by and large, is a situation where people don't fullyunderstand how the game operates or accidentally cut out the gamepiece in the wrong way,'' he said.   Traverse City attorney David Kipley, who also believed he hadwon, said the extra XXIIs may actually be XXIII with the last digitmissing - either accidentally left off by the printing machine orcut off by the contestants.   Hoch, who is married with two sons, said she did not cheat bycutting off the last digit of the game piece.   ``I would never even think of doing anything like that,'' shesaid.   Bertini said there are ``a miniscule number'' of similarrejected prize claims, but he refused to specify how many. Herejected Kipley's speculation that some game pieces could have beenmisprinted.   ``It is not a misprint problem,'' Bertini said. ``If it were amisprint, with 225 million game pieces out there, you would havewidespread problems, and that is just not the case.''   He said it is coincidence that three of the cases are inTraverse City.   Terry Brechbill, vice president of D.L. Blair, which informedeach player that their entries were invalid, did not return phonecalls Thursday and Friday.   Hoch said contest representatives showed her a photocopy of hergame ticket Thursday and tried to show her the beginning of theextra digit. She said she did not believe them.   ``It's heartbreaking,'' she said. ``It's not nice. And it's notright.''</TEXT></DOC>
