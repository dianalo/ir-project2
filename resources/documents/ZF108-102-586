(products).andO;Product:   FoxPro (Data base management system).andO;Topic:     Software PackagesEvaluationData Base Management Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FoxPro!andM;Wow!andP;  I wish it would run on my PC!andP;  When Fox Software previewed theirunprecedented FoxBASE+/Mac 2.0 in early 1988, the reaction of PC users waspredictable.andP;  FoxBASE+/Mac merged the data manipulating, application-buildingpower of the dBASE language with an innovative, Mac-like user interface, thenembellished the package with sophisticated developer tools.andP;  &quot;Too bad ittakes a Macintosh to support such a product.&quot;andP;  Or so we PC users thought.andM;A few months later, Fox Software disclosed--exclusively to Data Based Advisorreaders--details of an even more advanced version, FoxPro, under developmentfor PCs running MS-DOS.andP;  Contrary to popular wisdom, Fox was convinced theevent-driven Macintosh approach could be implemented on a character-basedcomputer.andP;  In Sept. 1989, Fox revealed FoxPro to over 600 people attendingthe first Fox Developers Conference, and sent them all home with apre-release version for final beta testing.andP;  On Nov. 9 Fox officiallyreleased FoxPro, then issued a Nov. 16 update to correct a production errorin the original release.andP;  Because Fox has a practice of implementing programcorrections whenever needed, the FoxPro you buy may well have a later date.andO;So FoxPro is here, and here, and here.andP;  This review is based on the Nov. 29release, though all versions are identified as FoxPro 1.0.andP;  (To see theactual release date, type &quot;? VERSION(1)&quot;.)andM;In FoxPro, Fox Software has raised the dBASE standard well beyondAshton-Tate's high water mark.andP;  Users, developers, competitors, and eventhose who have pronounced the dBASE standard &quot;dead&quot; must acknowledge theFoxPro achievement.andP;  Fox has given dBASE technology a new direction, a newlife, and perhaps a future.andP;  Nor is FoxPro 1.0 the ultimate extension ofdBASE technology.andP;  Fox plans exciting additions for FoxPro 1.1, FoxPro 2.0,and beyond.andP;  Elsewhere, Nantucket, the other major force pushing the dBASEplatform forward, advances with a different and extremely powerful metaphorin the coming Clipper 5.0.andP;  Ashton-Tate, much bigger than Fox and Nantucketcombined, is patching up a leaky dBASE IV.andP;  (A look at pre-release dBASE IV1.1 shows a much-improved product that may be quite acceptable in its ownright.)andP;  It's much too early to declare a winner (they all might be), or evena best choice.andP;  But it's not too early to foresee FoxPro becoming a potentproduct for both developers and users.andP;  Unless Fox fails to meet their ownspecifications, FoxPro has unlimited user-pleasing potential.andM;If you're involved in the dBASE world, whether you feel &quot;safe&quot; withAshton-Tate's dBASE, satisfied with FoxBASE+, or empowered by Clipper, youshould evaluate FoxPro.andP;  If you use a product like Paradox or R:BASE becausedBASE is &quot;too hard,&quot; the power of dBASE may now be reachable through FoxPro'snew interface.andP;  In this and coming issues Data Based Advisor will give youextensive information on FoxPro.andP;  The same treatment will be given to Clipper5.0 and the improved dBASE IV 1.1 when they become available.andP;  Based oninformation from FoxSoftware President, David Fulton, several months ofworking with pre-release FoxPro, and a few weeks with FoxPro 1.0's variousupdates, this special report is a review of what's new, what's different, andwhat's exciting.andM;What's a FoxPro?andM;As we explore FoxPro, comparisons to dBASE IV must be drawn.andP;  As competitiveproducts, functional similarities are intentional, but implementations varyin important ways.andP;  Like dBASE IV, FoxPro is several things in one.andP;  UnlikedBASE IV 1.0, where components feel bolted on, most of FoxPro 1.0 isseamlessly blended into one program.andP;  In fact, the various pieces sharecommon internal routines.andP;  For example, the same editor is used almosteverywhere, whether creating an index expression, revising a previouslyentered command line, editing a memo field or writing a program.andP;  Theexceptions are the add-on utilities FoxDoc, FoxCode and FoxView, alreadyprovided with FoxBASE+ 2.1 and essentially unchanged (unfortunately) forFoxPro 1.0.andP;  (For more information, see John Bauman's article next month.)andO;They're expected to be improved for FoxPro 1.1.andP;  FoxView, FoxDoc and theoptional FoxGraph appear as choices on the FoxPro system menu or they can berun from DOS, but as products from other vendors their look and feel differfrom FoxPro and from each other.andP;  All other facets of FoxPro are internal andavailable only from its system menu, by direct commands typed in, or throughprogramming.andM;The most obvious change in FoxPro is the interface.andP;  Gone is--shed atear--the dot prompt.andP;  There's a flashing cursor, but no dot!andP;  Instead, youtype all commands in a command window, that shows the current command lineand up to a full screen of previous commands.andP;  Across the top row of thescreen you'll see a horizontal menu with several menu pads, in the style ofIBM's Standard Application Architecture/Common User Access (SAA/CUA)standard.andP;  Selecting a menu pad reveals a pulldown menu of choices.andP;  Some ofthese call additional menus, or Mac-like dialog boxes, or other interactiveroutines.andP;  Overall, FoxPro's menus are easy to use, although somecombinations of operations require a bit of jumping around.andP;  Most FoxProfunctions can also be invoked by typing an equivalent dBASE language command.andO;As much as possible FoxPro eliminates the need to type.andP;  Just select frommenus.andP;  And if you can find space on your desk for a mouse to wriggle, FoxProeven eliminates a big chunk of keyboard use.andP;  Like every other mouse-orientedprogram I've tried, I find FoxPro easier to use with a mouse--like it or not.andO;This isn't really a fault of Fox or others trying to combine mouse andkeyboard interfaces.andP;  Because a mouse user can dart to various locations in adialog box and around the screen, FoxPro can't be locked into a rigid linearprogression of menu choices.andP;  The flexibility to jump across the screen andselect from several unrelated options speeds up program use tremendously.andO;Providing ways to handle such &quot;eventdriven&quot; actions from the keyboardrequires the use of more key combinations.andP;  The assigned keystrokes are notalways intuitive, and are different from the FoxBASE/dBASE/WordStar&quot;standard&quot; (a keyboard macro facility allows optional use of manyFoxBASE-compatible key assignments).andP;  Some of the eventdriven mechanism usedin the FoxPro interface is also available within applications, with more tocome.andM;Though FoxPro resembles dBASE IV in the use of SAA/CUA-style menus, beneaththat first layer FoxPro is definitely different.andP;  FoxPro uses &quot;true&quot; windowsfor almost all screen elements.andP;  These windows are treated like objects,meaning they can be manipulated independently of other screen elements.andP;  Mostinteractive pieces of FoxPro appear on screen in windows, which can be moved,sized, zoomed to full screen, or hidden from view.andP;  Windows can overlap andeven hide behind each other.andP;  Similar windows are available to developers.andO;Because of the window approach, the menu system, and enhanced interactiveediting tools, non-programmers can do quite a bit without knowing a singleFoxPro/dBASE command.andP;  For those who do know some of the language, it's quiteeasy to intermix menu choices and direct commands.andP;  In fact, selecting a menuchoice causes the corresponding language command to appear in the commandwindow, which is a great way to learn FoxPro.andP;  It's even possible to runthrough a series of menu operations, allow the equivalent commands toaccumulate, then cut and paste the command sequence into an editing windowfor inclusion in a program.andP;  A few activities available through the systemmenu, such as the calculator and calendar/diary, may not be especially usablein programs until Fox adds additional control and system variable access (notpromised but obviously needed).andM;FoxPro can read DBF data files created with FoxBASE+, Clipper, dBASE IIIPLUS, and dBASE IV.andP;  But the reverse is not true; other products cannotunderstand FoxPro's enhanced DBFs.andP;  A DBF that does not use either the FoxProfloat type numeric field nor FPT-format memo field should be readable by allof these products.andP;  A future update of FoxBASE+ may be able to recognizeFoxPro-specific DBFs.andP;  FoxPro uses FoxBASE+-compatible IDX indexes and willautomatically copy dBASE indexes to FoxPro format (the original dBASE indexesare thereafter abandoned).andP;  Memo fields are supported in both the common DBTformat and the new, improved FoxPro FPT format (see my memo field article).andO;FoxPro reads standard PRG and FMT source code files and compiles them intoits own runtime FXP and PRX formats.andP;  It can't use compiled FOX FoxBASE+ orDBO dBASE IV program files.andP;  FoxPro can use FoxBASE+ and dBASE III PLUS FRMreport definition files, and optionally convert them to FRX format.andM;Since setting up a session involving several database files, indexes,relations, and browse windows is a chore, FoxPro provides several mechanismsfor saving and restoring such environments.andP;  CREATE/SET VIEW saves andrestores the current status of all open DBF and NDX files, includingRELATIONS, using a VUE file.andP;  Some activities, like BROWSE, are saved inFoxPro's hidden Resource file, FOXUSER.DBF.andP;  BROWSE LAST restores the browsewindow as it was last exited.andP;  BROWSE PREFERENCE saves and restores a browsesession according to a predetermined combination of parameters.andP;  Environmentsettings needed to run a specific label can be saved and restored using anLBV file.andM;Against the clockandM;As always, Fox considers speed to be a fundamental requirement.andP;  Theyestimate FoxPro to be 2.6 times faster than FoxBASE+ 2.1, about two timesfaster than FoxBASE+/386, eight times faster than dBASE IV, and almost 16times faster than dBASE III PLUS.andP;  Some FoxPro facilities are not up to itsgenerally lightning-fast performance.andP;  For example, the dBASE IV-style menucommands are powerful, but the results can feel relatively slow, probably dueto memory management overhead.andP;  FoxPro is noticeably sensitive to the numberof memory-consuming features activated (like windows, menus, and browsesessions), and to the amount and types of RAM available.andP;  As such productsget more complex, determining what to compare and how to measure becomes moredifficult, so it is impossible to declare FoxPro &quot;the fastest.&quot;andP;  But in keyareas I'd definitely call it jet-propelled.andP;  (We'll be featuring our ownperformance tests in an upcoming issue.)andP;  For top speed: avoid FLUSH, SETDOHISTORY OFF, don't go crazy with windows, and free up memory.andM;Memory lossandM;FoxPro seems to require about 480K-plus to do anything useful, and much moreto do anything really sophisticated.andP;  In fact, it isn't too hard to create aprogram that simply won't run in 560K.andP;  For maximum performance, give it asmuch RAM as possible.andP;  Standard RAM is most important, so hardware add-onslike the Maxit board (from Osborne McGraw-Hill Software and recommended byFox Software) and certain software utilities that make unused reserved areaRAM available can be worthwhile investments.andP;  With some computer and videocombinations it's possible to extend a 640K machine to 704K or more.andP;  FoxProwill use as much expanded memory (LIM/EMS) as it finds, and is claimed todouble in speed with enough EMS.andP;  While FoxPro should run on an XT-class PC,a complex application with windows and pop-up menus can appear jerky.andP;  A 386computer is an ideal environment, since EMS memory can be added inexpensivelyby using software drivers like QEMM- 386 (from Quarterdeck Systems) or 386Max(from Qualitas).andP;  These drivers make unused reserved memory available, andconvert extended to expanded memory without special hardware.andP;  FoxProdirectly uses all 386Max memory and includes a utility to take full advantageof the extra memory QEMM makes available.andP;  (Fox says QEMM is three timesfaster at EMS access than 386Max.)andP;  FoxPro is also compatible with QEMM'spartner, DESQview (sold together as DESQview 386), and it will take advantageof a math coprocessor.andM;If you're familiar with such stand-alone Fox programs as FoxDoc, FoxView, andFoxGraph, you may wonder how they can be run from the FoxPro system menu.andO;Where does FoxPro &quot;go&quot; while these large external programs load and run?andP;  Itgets &quot;FoxSwapped.&quot;andP;  When any external program is to be run, whether a Foxutility or your own using the RUN command, FoxPro uses its FoxSwap memorymanager utility to free up enough RAM.andP;  Just specify the amount of memoryneeded to execute the external program, and FoxPro will temporarily removeenough of itself from memory.andP;  To make as much memory as possible available,specify &quot;RUN 0 andless;program nameandgt;&quot;.andP;  FoxSwap is even usable with FoxBASE+ to runa large external text editor.andM;The written wordandM;FoxBASE+ is known for sparse, inadequate manuals.andP;  The much-improved FoxProdocumentation includes several books: Users Guide, Commands andamp; Functions,FoxView/FoxCode/FoxDoc, and Quick Reference.andP;  A comprehensive online helpsystem is available within FoxPro.andP;  And instead of FoxBASE+'s recommendationthat &quot;any textbook for dBASE III PLUS can also be used as a reference forFoxBASE+,&quot; FoxPro comes with its own printed tutorial, demo program, andpractice files!andP;  Learning FoxPro isn't so much difficult as it is differentfrom predecessors like FoxBASE+ and dBASE III PLUS.andP;  Those familiar withdBASE IV will feel most at home, though FoxPro may take anyone some time toabsorb.andP;  It is time well spent.andP;  Technical support, struggling to keep upwith Fox's rapid growth, is available free with a call to Toledo, Ohio.andP;  Foxtries to direct tech support calls to a FoxPro group, but getting a returncall has been spotty.andP;  Fox also maintains a forum on CompuServe (PCVENA).andO;FoxPro is branded with a serial number but isn't copy protected.andM;For the FoxProfessionalandM;For developers, programmes and other power users, FoxPro creates a dilemma.andO;First, while the interface and several key functions are greatly improved,there's a lot to learn about all that is new.andP;  Second, as databaseapplication languages become more complex, it becomes more difficult to befluent in more than one dialect.andP;  FoxPro has more than 500 commands,functions, and system control variables, with hundreds of additional optionalclauses.andP;  To fully absorb FoxPro, you may find yourself unable to spend thetime to remain proficient with other products like dBASE or Clipper.andP;  Is itworth it?andP;  Should you choose FoxPro over dBASE?andM;dBASE IV 1.0 isn't even a contender.andP;  Independent developers familiar withboth products are already proclaiming FoxPro's features and implementation tobe superior to the approach taken by dBASE IV 1.1.andP;  (Some people who know thecurrent state of un-released dBASE IV 1.1 estimate that FoxPro represents atleast a one-year lead in programming achievement.)andM;As promising as FoxPro is, it is evolutionary, not revolutionary.andP;  Becoming aFoxPro requires great faith in the future of Fox Software.andP;  To attain andmaintain leadership Fox has to prove it can consistently deliver the goods.andO;Some beta testers were disturbed when Fox appeared to follow in Ashton-Tate'sfootsteps, releasing FoxPro with unresolved bugs.andP;  Other testers had noproblems and said FoxPro was rock-solid at release.andP;  My staff knew of a fewbugs that remained unresolved as of early December.andP;  Perhaps the contrastingopinions among beta testers resulted from the differing combination of FoxProcapabilities we used.andP;  Though both products were released with anomalies, thedifference between FoxPro 1.0 and dBASE IV 1.0 might be described asstability and strategy.andP;  The types of bugs found in early release of FoxProseem to be consistent, meaning they can be identified and worked-around (and,we hope, corrected).andP;  dBASE IV's quirks appear randomly, and cause totallyunpredictable crashes.andP;  According to dBASE IV trainer Adam Green, you can'tprogram around the problems in dBASE IV 1.0; Green finds no similarinstability in FoxPro 1.0 (and has just added FoxPro to his classes).andP;  FoxProbugs seem to be minor, and Fox's solution is to try and fix them within daysof discovery, providing a free update to anyone who reports a problem.andP;  Whenenough bugs have been excised, Fox plans to send a mass update to all users.andO;Early FoxPro users are remarkably tolerant of this approach, explaining thatall 1.0 products of this complexity are imperfect.andP;  What counts, they say, isthat FoxPro is fundamentally sound, and any problems will be resolvedquickly.andP;  Ashton-Tate has not pursued a similar fix-bugs-as-we-find-themtactic, and has been unable to provide users with a repaired dBASE IV in overone year.andM;Fox has ambitious plans, and Nantucket is certainly in its sights too.andP;  ButFoxPro isn't a total replacement for Clipper--yet.andP;  Clipper is extremelypowerful, and release 5.0 will eliminate some major limitations (thoughNantucket didn't meet its announced release date).andP;  Other elements ofNantucket Future Technology (NFT) promise to extend the power of Clipper'sadvancement over dBASE programming in ways FoxPro may never approach.andP;  On theother hand, even hard-core Clipper-heads (as some like to call themselves)may be tempted to switch projects to the extremely productive interactivedevelopment environment FoxPro offers.andP;  Software developers, like slalomskiers, are always racing the clock.andP;  It's a rare client who will say, &quot;Takeyour time.andP;  I'll pay whatever it costs.&quot;andP;  Mostly, programming projects areconstrained by fixed budgets and critical deadlines.andP;  So anything that getsthe job done faster and better is money in the pocket.andP;  FoxPro offers anefficient application development environment unprecedented in the dBASEworld.andM;There are many ways to set up FoxPro to aid coding and debugging.andP;  I'lldescribe my typical set-up as an example.andP;  Using a VGA monitor system, Ienter FoxPro and issue the command SET DISPLAY TO VGA50 (or I do itautomatically via the CONFIG.FP file).andP;  Since a standard PC screen is 25lines, when I run my application, it fills just the top half of the screen.andO;In the bottom half I open trace, debug, editing, and command windows, allsized and moved to fit.andP;  As the program executes, I can watch it unobstructedwhile also watching the program code display line by line in the tracewindow.andP;  The live, changing values of any variables and expressions that needanalysis are displayed in the debug window.andP;  I can slow down or single stepthe program as needed and set break points in the code.andP;  When a break pointis reached, the program crashes, or I suspend with Esc, I can pop directlyinto the editor window, make changes to my source code, then rerun theprogram (from the top, since there is no way to edit the active PRG andresume execution).andP;  FoxPro will automatically recompile the changes to disk.andO;Or I can move to the FoxPro system menu and take action, or issue commands inthe command window.andP;  All of this occurs on a single screen with everythingdisplayed simultaneously.andP;  Characters on a VGA 50-line screen are a littlecrowded, but I can do so much so fast that a project really moves along.andO;Even without a monitor system that can display 50 lines (or 43 lines withEGA), FoxPro's multiple windows save time.andP;  Just shrink them down a bit andoverlap less- important areas of the application screen.andP;  Or tell FoxPro toinvoke the trace window only if an error or breakpoint is encountered.andP;  Intheory, you'll never have to leave FoxPro to write and debug a completeapplication.andP;  (Though FoxPro's slow, awkward editor might make it hard tostay in FoxPro when working on a sophisticated application.)andM;Using Clipper--even Clipper 5.0 with its promised large improvements inlinking and debugging--this unified approach is impossible.andP;  (Nantucketpresident Larry Heimendinger has told me Clipper won't be providing any formof interactive development environment.)andP;  To develop quickly in Clipper andFoxBASE+ I resort to two networked computers, one to run the application, theother to edit and compile it.andP;  For me, FoxPro liberates one entire computer.andM;FoxPro also liberates many previous limits, although Clipper remains thechampion of the boundless.andP;  FoxPro supports 25 open database files with 25total open indexes.andP;  Up to 99 files of all types can be open at once (subjectto DOS).andP;  A record can have 255 fields, with 254 maximum characters perfield, to 4,000 total characters per record Numeric fields can store up to 20digits, including decimal and sign, with 16 digits of numeric computationalprecision.andP;  Memory variables can range up to 3,600.andP;  DO calls can be nested32 levels, READs can be nested four levels.andP;  A FoxPro program command line islimited to 1,024 characters.andP;  Maximum individual compiled program module sizeis 64K per FXP file (meaning a PRG of around 100K).andP;  Up to 64 structuredprogramming commands can be active at one time.andP;  Up to 25 BROWSE windows canbe open at once, and the total number of open windows is limited only bymemory.andP;  Memory is definitely a limitation.andP;  Experimentation reveals that areal application runs out of free memory long before most of these limits arereached.andP;  For example, each BROWSE session takes 16K.andP;  A network applicationthat opens 10 simultaneous BROWSE windows may be maxed-out (if you have areason to do so).andP;  Each file loaded in the text editor requires two filehandles, meaning the DOS FILES=statement in CONFIG.SYS may need to beincreased, further reducing memory available to FoxPro.andP;  It is clear thatsophisticated programming with FoxPro requires a more structured approach tomemory management.andP;  Even though dBASE III PLUS and FoxBASE+ programs shouldrun just fine, programs written specifically for FoxPro should adopt acompletely different structural approach.andP;  Clipper programmers may already befamiliar with the modular, procedural style FoxPro allows, an approach thatactually makes application development and maintenance easier.andP;  (Here aresome hints: put common code in subroutines in the form of procedures andfunctions, and don't leave things in memory you don't immediately need.)andM;The editorandM;When I say &quot;built-in editor,&quot; do your eyes glaze over?andP;  If you're thinking ofthose clumsy beasts contained in dBASE III PLUS and FoxBASE+, think again.andO;FoxPro's internal editor, while not a threat to the popularity ofprofessional editors Brief/dBrief and QEdit, has much of the program writingcapability many people will need.andP;  (In fact, I wrote a large portion of abook using FoxPro's editor and memo fields!)andP;  The same editor engine isinvoked any time you need to edit anything.andP;  Called by pull-down menu, bytyping MODIFY COMMAND or MODIFY FILE, or by the debugger during testing,FoxPro's editor provides find/replace (though primitive), cut/paste, variabletabs, auto-indentation, and full undo/redo for the entire session.andP;  You cancut and paste almost anything between open files; FoxPro even includes ascreen capture cut/paste facility.andP;  Specific editing defaults can be definedfor different file extensions.andP;  There's no limit on line and file lengthexcept available disk space.andP;  Like most FoxPro objects, the editor appears ina window.andP;  This means it can be sized and moved freely (as I do for my50-line screen set-up).andP;  In fact, you can open multiple files in multipleedit windows, making it easy to work on an entire application.andP;  You can openfiles by wildcard, and even type MODIFY COMMAND *.PRG (BRIEF can do thistoo).andP;  A RANGE option will even move the cursor at specified characterswithin the edit window.andP;  The editor can tolerate null and end-of-file codes,making it possible to edit any type of file.andP;  It's even possible to load in aDBF, edit a field name, then save the DBF back to disk, changed but otherwiseunharmed (this isn't the recommended way to change field names!).andP;  Fox plansto continue to improve editing facilities as FoxPro evolves.andP;  (The editor ismissing some obvious functions, like cursor line/column information and smartsource code formatting.andP;  The file opening dialog box annoyingly defaults to&quot;database&quot;, not the &quot;program&quot; files developers will be using.andP;  And the editoris noticeably slower than Brief and QEdit.)andP;  By the way, if you don't likeFoxPro's editor, just tell it to automatically use your own.andM;Refining the languageandM;I find it more and more difficult to talk about the &quot;dBASE language.&quot;andP;  ThedBASE III PLUS of 1986 may be the last product to universally define the corelanguage.andP;  Since then each compatible product has extended the languagedifferently.andP;  FoxPro 1.0 claims to be 100-percent language compatible withFoxBASE+ 2.1 and dBASE III PLUS, mostly compatible with dBASE IV 1.0, andsomewhat compatible with Clipper Summer '87.andP;  Where dialects differ,programmers can often just change a keyword or rewrite a command line toconvert a program.andP;  But a FoxPro application that uses all of its power won'tbe readily translatable into any other dialect.andP;  For example, FoxPro supportsdBASE IV's window and menu commands, but not the other way around.andP;  BecauseClipper is so extensible, much of what a FoxPro application might do could beimplemented in Clipper through UDFs and third-party libraries--with enoughtime and money.andP;  But no single dBASE language product offers the breadth,depth and sophistication of FoxPro's native functionality.andP;  Of the 500-pluscommands and functions (and hundreds of optional clauses), the FoxProlanguage adds more than 200 not found in FoxBASE+, over 150 not found indBASE IV, and over 100 not found in either.andP;  These enhancements take manyforms.andP;  Several bring FoxPro to near-parity with Clipper and dBASE IV, whilemany aspects are notably improved: windows, menus, browse, memo fields, mousecontrol, reports and labels, and user-defined functions.andP;  Only a few fallshort.andP;  Some FoxPro features included simply because dBASE IV offers them areunnecessary or even useless.andM;Even though FoxPro and FoxBASE+ act like interpreters, both require thatsource code PRG files be compiled before execution.andP;  (If necessary, FoxBASE+will do this invisibly and temporarily to RAM; but it does happen.)andP;  If anup-to-date compiled FXP file doesn't exist on disk, FoxPro will automaticallycompile one from a PRG, visibly, intelligently, and permanently.andP;  While athird party &quot;make&quot; utility is desirable with FoxBASE+, FoxPro has onebuilt-in.andP;  When a program file is called, FoxPro compares PRG date and timeto the compiled FXP version (if any).andP;  FoxPro automatically recompiles thePRG if appropriate, then executes the FXP.andP;  Automatic compilation can bedeactivated (SET DEVELOPMENT OFF), and compiling can also be done manually.andO;Errors generated during a compile can automatically be sent to acorresponding ERR file for review.andP;  Compiling is only available from withinFoxPro, so consultants who make PRG changes in the field for runtimeenvironments will have to adopt a different approach than carrying theFoxBASE+ FOXPCOMP program around (maybe Fox will provide a standalone FoxProcompiler utility?).andP;  FoxPro FXP compiled files are larger than FoxBASE FOXfiles, mainly due to the inclusion of additional debugging code.andP;  Fox has aprocedure to remove this extra code from the final version of an application.andM;In addition to 25 open databases, FoxPro uses two &quot;hidden&quot; DBF databases thatdevelopers can take advantage of.andP;  The on-line help system, called with F1,is a database that can be revised, or even substituted to addcontext-sensitive help to an application.andP;  A &quot;resource file&quot; database storesFoxPro defaults as well as programmer-specified parameters for browsewindows, colors, and more.andP;  As with FoxBASE+, FoxPro allows multiplerelations, but with more flexibility.andP;  To disconnect some but not all of acomplex relationship, use SET RELATION OFF INTO...andP;  A new function,RELATION(), reveals the active relationship expression.andP;  RECNO(0) can be usedas a softseek function to determine the next highest record when a SEEKfails.andM;Whatever your video display system, FoxPro can probably support its tricks,including standard 25x80, plus EGA43 and VGA50-line modes, in any imaginablecolor combination.andP;  SYS(2008) determines the type of video adapter andmonitor in use, and SET DISPLAY TO sets the video mode.andP;  FoxPro's colorcontrol methods respond to the SET COLOR TO command.andP;  But with so many newdisplay components, it's easier to define all elements once, then use the SETCOLOR OF SCHEME command to make global changes that would require 10 of theolder command lines.andP;  FoxPro also includes a comprehensive interactive colorselection screen.andP;  However, the color picker isn't available from withinprograms.andM;Like Clipper, FoxPro procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs) can beembedded within any PRG (up to 1,170 per PRG), allowing modular andself-contained subroutine-style programming.andP;  FoxPro will first look forsomething identified as a PROCEDURE or FUNCTION in the current PRG, then inan activated procedure file, in the chain of calling PRGs, and finally ondisk for a file of the same name.andP;  FoxPro can't look within PRGs that arecurrently inactive.andP;  Unlike Clipper, once a FoxPro PRG terminates, theprocedures and UDFs it contains are no longer available.andP;  (In Clipper, anylinked procedures and UDFs are globally available as long as their codesegment isn't in a non-loaded overlay.)andP;  To make certain FoxPro subroutinesglobally available, put them in the highest level (master) PRG and/or put upto 1,170 of them in a single file and use SET PROCEDURE TO andless;fileandgt;.andP;  The UDFcapabilities of FoxBASE+ are very limited, as are the UDFs of dBASE IV (to beexpanded in version 1.1).andP;  In contrast, FoxPro allows UDFs that are almost asflexible as Clipper's, since any command can be issued in a UDF (Clipperallows UDFs to be used in more places).andP;  FoxPro allows a variable number ofparameters to be passed, making it possible to create general purposesubroutines that can be called with only as many parameters as are needed.andO;FoxPro adopts and extends the menu building tools found in dBASE IV.andP;  Complexhorizontal bar, pull-down, and pop-up menus can be created and controlledthrough concise commands.andP;  All such menus automatically support a mouse.andO;FoxPro's menu commands internally create and manage complicated controlloops, removing them from the programmer's burden.andP;  Amazingly, I wrote acomplex menu-driven multi-level application without a single DO WHILE loop!andO;however, some developers dislike the dBASE IV menu generation approach andprefer the FoxBASE+ menu style, which is also available in FoxPro.andP;  I'm nottotally satisfied with either method.andP;  Maybe FoxPro version 1.1, which willprovide FoxBASE+/Mac style menus, will make everyone happy.andM;FoxPro provides for complex VALID clauses (which can contain UDFs), nestedREADs, complex INKEY() processing, and extended multiple ON KEY trapping.andP;  Itsupports &quot;!&quot; for .NOT., &quot;!=&quot; for andless;andgt; and #, &quot;==&quot; for an exact comparison, and&quot;{12/25/89}&quot; to specify a date data type.andP;  Functions that return an unneededvalue can be preceeded by &quot;=&quot; without using a scratch variable.andP;  FoxProprovides two-dimensional arrays of up to 3,600 elements.andP;  With FoxPro'sClipper-like low-level file I/O functions (FWRITE(), FREAD(), and FSEEK(),you can manipulate any kind of DOS file if you know its structure.andP;  This letsprogrammers share data stored in foreign formats.andM;Making newsandM;The FoxPro report writer allows creation of complex banded reports andsophisticated labels without programming.andP;  Headings, data, calculated fields,subtotals, groupings, headers, footers, title and summary pages, text, andeven boxes can be laid out very flexibly.andP;  UDFs can be embedded almostanywhere in reports.andP;  Layouts can be previewed on screen.andP;  The system printcontrol memory variables introduced in dBASE IV are available for furthercontrol.andP;  Unfortunately, an intelligent printer driver system similar todBASE IV's will not appear until FoxPro 1.1.andP;  Also missing from FoxPro'sreport writer is dBASE IV's ability to generate actual source code.andP;  It's notthat FoxPro can't produce similar reports; it just doesn't provide suchreports in source code form.andP;  A major benefit to this is that users will haveaccess to the report writer, even in runtime versions of FoxPro.andP;  On theother hand, many programmers mention report code generation as the majordBASE IV feature missing from FoxPro.andM;Good lookingandM;The basic design of FoxPro's user interface begins with the dBASE IV windowsconcept, but FoxPro gives the programmer much more to work with.andP;  For onething, FoxPro uses true windows where dBASE IV uses pictures of windows.andO;This means FoxPro information can be written to the screen underneath awindow, while in dBASE IV the window will be overwritten.andP;  FoxPro can evenwrite to a hidden window object.andP;  FoxPro adds several ways to control itswindow objects.andP;  DEFINE WINDOW includes options to allow the user to size,zoom, close, and move a window interactively while running the application.andO;ACTIVATE WINDOW...NO SHOW sends output to a hidden window, which can later bedisplayed as needed.andP;  Use HIDE WINDOW to make one or all disappear withoutbeing closed.andP;  CLOSE MEMO closes some or all memo editing windows.andO;WLCOL()/WLROW() determine the upper left corner of a window on the screen,WCOLS()/WROWS() return the size of the window, and WONTOP() determines ifit's currently on top of all other windows.andP;  WEXIST() says whether a windowexists, WVISIBLE() says whether it's visible, and WOUTPUT() determines ifoutput is directed to it.andP;  SCOLS()/SROWS() return the size of the physicalscreen.andM;Commanding presenceandM;The following are some of the exciting new commands and functions in FoxPro:andM;* In addition to SCAN...ENDSCAN introduced in dBASE IV, FoxPro offersFOR...ENDFOR (with slightly different syntax than Clipper) as a cleaner wayto do certain kinds of loops.andM;* To meet more real-world needs, TOTAL ON now takes an expression as well asjust a field name.andM;* Very useful in accounting, GOMONTH(n) figures out the date that's exactly nmonths before or after a given date.andM;* If you've ever struggled to write a routine to let users build their ownFILTER, FOR, or INDEX expressions, GETEXPR is a dream come true.andP;  It invokesthe FoxPro expression builder, a much more sophisticated tool than you'd everwrite on your own.andM;* FILTER() returns an active filter expression.andM;* FILER calls a FoxPro routine that resembles directory tree utilities,allowing a user to visually manage files and directories from within anapplication.andM;* CURDIR() returns the current DOS directory on any drive.andM;* FULLPATH() provides the full DOS path name for a file.andM;* PUTFILE() invokes FoxPro's Save File dialog box so the user can specify afile name.andM;* SCATTER...MEMVAR...EMPTY can save many STORE...TO lines of code by creatingmemory variables with the same name as the open database's fields.andP;  Eitherthe record's data is put in the memvars, or they're created empty.andP;  Sincethis creates memvars with the same name as fields, use of the M prefix ismandatory (and generally a good idea).andP;  In addition to the dBASE standard&quot;M-andgt;memvar&quot; syntax, FoxPro allows the more concise alternative &quot;M.memvar&quot;.andO;Put memory variables back into fields with a single GATHER...FIELDS line,rather then with many REPLACE commands.andM;* AT() can return the starting position of the n occurrence of a characterstring.andP;  ATC() does the same but is case-insensitive.andM;* ATLINE() also has a case-insensitive version, ATCLINE(), to find the linenumber of a string.andP;  This is very useful in memo fields.andM;* RAT() and RATLINE() determine the start of a string in reverse, beginningat the end.andM;* BETWEEN() determines if an expression falls between two other expressions,whether character, numeric or date.andM;* OCCURS() determines the number of occurrences of one string in another.andM;* INLIST() is a similar, redundant function.andM;* CHRTRAN() translates characters of a string using a translate table.andM;* STRTRAN() searches for a string and replaces it, just like a word processorsearch and replace routine.andM;* MIN() and MAX() work on any kind of data.andM;* SECONDS() returns the system time to an accurate 1,000th of a second.andM;* LASTKEY() returns the decimal ASCII value of the last key pressed.andM;* CHRSAW() determines if a character is in the keyboard buffer withoutaffecting the buffer.andM;* Check and control the keyboard with CAPSLOCK(), INSMODE(), and NUMLOCK().andM;* PADL(), PADC(), and PADR() pads or truncates left, center, or right of acharacter string to the specified length.andM;* PROPER() capitalizes the first letter of each word, but isn't smart enoughto be of much actual use.andM;* LIKE() gives the DOS-like ability to compare the contents of two variables,one with wildcard symbols * and ?.andM;* Two functions provide tools to identify similar sounding but differentlyspelled words.andP;  DIFFERENCE() compares two character strings and returns anumber indicating their phonetic similarity or difference.andP;  SOUNDEX() returnsa code representing a strings &quot;sound&quot;.andM;* The direct DBF editing commands BROWSE, EDIT and CHANGE have such anincredible number of options that they should find a useful new place indeveloped applications.andP;  Creating a BROWSE-like table view of data has alwaysbeen a cumbersome programming task, but necessary since the actual BROWSEcommand in FoxBASE+ and dBASE III PLUS is too uncontrollable to include in anapplication.andP;  FoxPro's BROWSE is a new ball game, an amazing implementation,programmable in almost every aspect.andP;  This list of optional clauses shouldwhet your appetite: BROWSE...FIELDS, FORMAT, FREEZE andless;fieldandgt;, KEY andless;exprandgt;,LAST, NOAPPEND, NOCLEAR, NODELETE, NOEDIT, NORMAL, NOWAIT, PREFERENCE, SAVE,TIMEOUT, TITLE, WIDTH, WINDOW, and COLOR.andP;  BROWSE can display calculatedfields and read-only fields; field data can be validated and/or limited to arange; field headings, conditional field editing, width and data formattingpictures can be specified on a field-by-field basis; and UDFs can be embeddedin a BROWSE clause.andP;  The same options can also be used with CHANGE/EDIT.andM;Getting along with othersandM;Fox has attempted to make FoxPro reasonably compatible with dBASE IV,although it's not clear how important thss will be to users.andP;  Perhapscommercial source code developers/publishers like SBT, SourceMate, andChampion will choose to support only the command subset that will run withboth products.andP;  Most dBASE IV applications should run unchanged in FoxPro,unless they rely on dBASE-only capabilities.andP;  For example, many dBASE IVprograms use the MDX-type index.andP;  FoxPro does not yet support MDX, but anapplication that uses the FoxBASE/dBASE III approach to indexes would runwith both dBASE IV and FoxPro.andP;  FoxPro has one fundamental problem ininhibiting dBASE IV compatibility.andP;  Several features added to FoxBASE+ in1987 have been implemented somewhat differently in dBASE IV 1.0.andP;  Yet Foxwants FoxPro to support all FoxBASE+ applications while also handling dBASEIV code.andP;  So a special command, SET COMPATIBLE TO FOXPLUS | DB4, is needed totell FoxPro which interpretation to place on an ambiguous command.andP;  LIKE(),PLAY MACRO, SELECT (), STORE (with arrays), and various WINDOW commands areaffected.andP;  FoxPro differs from dBASE IV in several areas.andP;  For example,FoxPro treats most on-screen elements as objects.andP;  In dBASE IV pop-up menusare just screen images, while in FoxPro they appear in true windows.andP;  FoxProcan write something underneath a displayed window, while dBASE IV can onlywrite on top of a window.andP;  Fox has added command options to allow aprogrammer to control such interactions and to make the code act like dBASEIV.andP;  The size and position of dBASE IV windows can be specified when defined,but are fixed once displayed.andP;  FoxPro also defaults to a fixed display, but aprogrammer can allow interactive user control.andP;  FoxPro also exceeds dBASE IVin such areas as BROWSE, UDFs, available work areas, speed, and, we hope,reliability.andP;  Yet FoxPro leaves some things out.andP;  dBASE IV features missinginclude the Query By Example facility (QBE), dBASE's more sophisticatedscreen painter, SQL command support, transaction tracking, a report generatorcapable of writing actual program code, support for MDX indexes, and theuseful capabilities built into the commands SET SKIP TO and LOOKUP() (alreadya reserved word).andP;  The company said it plans to add at least MDX, SET SKIP,and LOOKUP to FoxPro 1.1.andP;  SQL and transaction processing will be part of afuture server version.andM;Perhaps the most noticeable divergence from dBASE IV stems from FoxPro'sintimate support for a mouse.andP;  Any FoxBASE+ or dBASE program, run in FoxPro,will automatically work with a mouse.andP;  All aspects of FoxPro interactive andapplication-driven activity are much more fluid for those who choose to use amouse.andP;  Beginners and poor typists are especially advised to adopt a mousewith FoxPro.andP;  Several functions are available in FoxPro to monitor mouseposition and button clicks, making it possible to invent new mouse-drivenroutines for applications.andP;  Because mouse random access isn't alwaysappropriate, a READ...NOMOUSE option is available when the user shouldn't beallowed to jump among GETs.andP;  Fox wants you to try a mouse so much thatthey'll sell you one cheap (a Dexxa Mouse for $34.95 plus $5 shipping).andO;FoxPro supports only Microsoft compatible mice (such as Logitech, which makesDexxa).andP;  Various other mouse brands and models may not work without a newdriver.andM;ConnectivityandM;FoxPro/LAN, expected about the time you read this, will reduce the need to doexplicit record and file locking in several ways.andP;  In most cases, FoxPro willattempt to automatically issue a lock when needed.andP;  As in FoxBASE+/LANGET/READ and REPLACE require that the record be locked first.andP;  If not,FoxBASE+ won't do anything but produce an error.andP;  FoxPro will first try tolock the record.andP;  A new command borrowed (and enhanced) from dBASE IV tellsFoxPro what to do if the first lock attempt is unsuccessful.andP;  You can SETPROCESS AUTOMATIC retries indefinitely while displaying an &quot;Attempting tolock, press ESC to cancel&quot; message.andP;  If the user does cancel, an ON ERRORroutine can take appropriate action.andP;  FoxPro/LAN should run quite a bitfaster than FoxBASE+/LAN 2.1, which was never optimized for multiuseractivities.andP;  (Fox plans to release updates to speed up the multiuserperformance of FoxBASE+ and FoxBASE+/Mac soon after FoxPro/LAN appears).andP;  AREAD...TIMEOUT option has been added as a way to sidestep network lock-upswhen a user goes to lunch in the middle of a GET...READ.andM;Because dBASE IV has it (though it's been removed from version 1.1), Foxshowed an early version of FoxPro with SQL at COMDEX/Fall '88.andP;  But Fultondoesn't believe anyone wants or needs local workstation SQL support.andP;  dBASEIV-like transaction processing and SQL language support will be implementedwhen FoxPro is interfaced to a network database server.andM;FoxPro 1.1andM;To get FoxPro 1.0 out the door, some features have been held until version1.1.andP;  According to the company, the 64K limit on string-pool size will belifted, such dBASE IV innovations as LOOKUP(), SET SKIP TO and MDX multipleindex file support will be added, and the menuing style of FoxBASE+/Mac,which Fulton calls &quot;the real FoxPro menus,&quot; will appear.andP;  The next release ofFoxPro is expected to give programmers access to various internal FoxProcomponents such as dialog boxes and radio buttons.andP;  According to Fulton,FoxPro 1.1 will allow creation of Clipper-like EXE programs, removing theneed to use FoxPro or a runtime version to execute an application.andP;  For somepeople, this will make FoxPro a &quot;real&quot; programming language (though Fultonconsiders it a &quot;packaging issue&quot;).andP;  Like Clipper, FoxPro's runtime librarywill be built into the EXEs it generates.andP;  To save disk space, Fox plans tomake it optionally possible to reduce EXE size by specifying just one runtimelibrary for all FoxPro EXEs on a system.andP;  EXE generation will be nice, butthe most far- reaching enhancement in FoxPro 1.1 will be a documentedApplications Programming Interface (API).andP;  With access to low-level FoxProinternals, developers may be able to add an endless range of capabilities.andO;Expect a lively third-party aftermarket to develop for FoxPro 1.1 much as ithas for Clipper.andM;FoxPro 2.0andM;According to Fulton, central database server support will be added in FoxPro2.0, due sometime in 1990.andP;  Depending on demand, several server engines maybe interfaces.andP;  The first announced FoxPro server will be a customizedversion of Novell's NetWare SQL, which Fox will call FoxServer.andP;  (Netware SQLruns as part of Novell NetWare.andP;  It appears that only the expensive NetWare386 will be supported, not the ubiquitous Advanced NetWare 286.andP;  Smallercompanies may not be willing to upgrade to a 386 server and pay an extra$5,000 to Novell just to give FoxServer its required environment.)andO;Alternatively, the FoxPro 1.1 applications programming interface might beflexible enough to allow third-party support for various database servers,like those from Oracle, Sybase (the same one used by Ashton-Tate andMicrosoft in SQL Server), and Emerald Bay.andP;  Wayne Ratliff's Emerald Baydatabase engine could be especially welcome because it requires nothing morethan an XT-class computer on Novell or any NETBIOS-compatible network.andO;Ratliff and Fox president David Fulton have discussed this possibility.andM;Nothing to fear but ourselves.andM;FoxPro is a technical success, approachable by non-programmers andsophisticated developers alike.andP;  For new users, learning FoxPro, even at thesystem menu level, may not be a trivial task.andP;  For starters, users mustunderstand database management issues and dBASE conventions.andP;  But the rewardfor learning FoxPro basics is entry into the almost-unlimited world of dBASE.andO;Like earlier forms of dBASE, once learned, FoxPro is easy to use.andP;  Theability to intermix menu choices, the dBASE/FoxPro language, and savedprocedures (programs) gives FoxPro users tremendous flexibility and control.andO;FoxPro lets you manually type whatever commands you choose, while using themenu system to have FoxPro itself type commands for more complex or obscureactivities.andP;  By watching what FoxPro types into the command window, you canlearn the correct syntax for every action.andM;Old hands experienced with FoxBASE+ or dBASE III PLUS at the dot prompt mayfeel constrained by FoxPro's structured interface and menus, but that's apremature judgement.andP;  It is quite possible to resize the command window toprovide the same feel as the old interactive command line, and the otherFoxPro facilities are unprecedented.andP;  Beside, you can always ignore the partsthat don't appeal to you.andM;To some people, the main wildcard in FoxPro's future is Fox Software itself.andO;Fox has credited its small size, family atmosphere, and tightly-knit,long-standing programming team for its technical accomplishments and customersatisfaction.andP;  In 1984, when dBASE III was introduced, Ashton-Tate hadsimilar qualities.andP;  Look what success brought.andP;  Can Fox Software grow,perhaps rapidly, without losing the very qualities that made FoxPro possible?andO;Will we like the new Fox?andP;  For Dave Fulton and his talented staff, creatingFoxPro may have been the first challenge; surviving its success may be thesecond.andM;Buying FoxProandM;FoxPro is priced at $795 for the single-user version, $1,095 for FoxPro/LAN,and an additional $500 for an unlimited runtime version that works in eithersingle or multiuser mode depending on the serial number of the master copy.andO;The company expected LAN and runtime versions to go into beta duringDecember, and to be available in final form during late January or earlyFebruary.andP;  At that same time the company will send out FoxPro 1.01, a freemaintenance upgrade, to all registered users.andP;  To encourage mouse use, Fox isselling serial mice for $34.95.andP;  Upgrading from single-user FoxBASE+ toFoxPro is $195, from FoxBASE+/LAN to FoxPro/LAN, $250, and from FoxBASE+Runtime to FoxPro Runtime, $50.andP;  All upgrades are done directly through FoxSoftware.andP;  It was originally announced that the upgrade from 1.0 to FoxPro1.1, when available, would be free, but there may be a charge if 1.1 turnsout to significantly expand features.andP;  FoxBASE+ will remain on the market.andM;Fox Software is located at 134 W.
