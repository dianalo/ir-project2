Chock Full O'Nuts Corp., a coffee roaster, said effective immediately, it will increase its wholesale list price 20 cents, to $3 a pound, for its all-method grind because &quot;of the price rise of high quality green coffees used in our blend.&quot;    No other major roasters announced price increases. A spokesman for the Maxwell House division of General Foods Corp., in White Plains, N.Y., said it hadn't raised prices, but wouldn't comment on future price increases. General Foods is a unit of Philip Morris Cos.    A spokeswoman for Procter andamp; Gamble Co. in Cincinnati said its Folger Coffee Co. unit hadn't raised prices and had no plans to increase them at this time.    One analyst, however, said that as roasters come in for more supplies at higher prices, &quot;They'll have to pass increased costs on to consumers.&quot;    Leon Pordy, Chock Full O'Nuts chairman and chief executive officer, said the growing tightness of better grades of coffee &quot;forced the price increase.&quot; He said the company had to &quot;either reduce the quality of our coffee or raise the price to maintain the integrity of our product.&quot;    Dealers and importers of green unroasted coffee beans cited the reimposition of export quotas by the International Coffee Organization last October as the reason for the scarcity of better grades of coffee. The organization is the parent of the International Coffee Agreement to which the overwhelming majority of coffee producing and consuming nations belong.    Export quotas were suspended in early 1986, when prices soared because drought damaged Brazil's crop. Subsequently, prices dropped sharply, and quotas were restored.    Under the current international agreement -- which began in 1983 and will expire on Sept. 30, 1989 -- export quotas for all producing countries are increased if prices go up a certain amount. While this could increase the availability of certain types of coffee, it might not do so enough to meet current demand, one dealer said. </TEXT></DOC>
