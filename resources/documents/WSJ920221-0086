The two-part agreement in principle will further Lilly'seffort to focus on the proprietary pharmaceuticals, medicaldevices and diagnostics that represent its core operations.</LP><TEXT>   It also marks the latest in a trend in which U.S. drugcompanies are increasingly distancing themselves from theirJapanese venture partners.   Lilly and Shionogi have made Qualicaps, which are hardgelatin capsules, through a joint venture in Japan for 25years. Shionogi will pay an undisclosed amount to theIndianapolis pharmaceutical giant to gain full ownership ofthe venture, as well as Lilly's Qualicaps operations in theU.S., Europe and Mexico.   The sale makes sense for Lilly because the Qualicapsbusiness is relatively small and &quot;didn't fit very well&quot; withthe company's core operations, said analyst Ronald Nordmannof PaineWebber. &quot;Lilly has been downsizing its operations fora number of years,&quot; he said, and the Qualicaps business was&quot;one of the last remaining unmatched businesses.&quot;   Additionally, hard gelatin capsules are relativelyoutdated; most growth currently is in soft gelatin and othertypes of capsules, Mr. Nordmann said.   On the flip side of the planned transaction, Shionogi willgive back to Lilly the rights to market Humulin in Japan, theworld's second-largest pharmaceutical market. The companieswill co-promote the genetically engineered human insulinuntil July 1996, when Lilly will become the sole marketer.Shionogi has marketed Humulin there for Lilly since 1986,when it was introduced in the country.</TEXT></DOC>
