(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Colt's Manufacturing Co. announcedWednesday the resignation of its president and chief executive,Richard F. Gamble, who helped arrange a state-backed buyout inMarch that ended a three-year strike at the gun maker.   The company said Ronald E. Stilwell, an 18-year veteran ofColt's who also participated in the management-led buyout, willbecome the new president.   Colt's, which makes the military's M-16 rifle, did notimmediately name a new CEO, but company Chairman Anthony D.Autorino said Stilwell would be a candidate for that job as well.   In March, Gamble, Autorino and Colt Firearms executives joinedwith striking workers and the state to buy the gun maker from itsparent, Colt Industries. The buyout, which drew some criticismbecause it brought the state into the gun making business, ended abitter, three-year strike at the company.   Last week, a state financial report indicated the market valueof the state's $25 million investment of pension funds in Colt'sdecreased by about 13 percent in the cmmpany's first three months.   But officials said Wednesday the company is in good financialhealth, thanks largely to Gamble's efforts during six months aspresident and CEO.   ``The state's investment in Colt's remains a fiscally prudentone,'' state Treasurer Francisco L. Borges said in a preparedstatement.   Autorino said Gamble had planned to return to retirement afterleading the new company through its first six months.   Both Autorino and Kathleen Palm, an aide to Borges, said Colt'shas improved financially since June 30.   Colt's makes handguns and rifles for sporting, law enforcementand military use. Its products include the Colt 45 pistol, theSporter rifle and the M-16. ``We expect to see our militarybusiness grow in the near future,'' Autorino said. ``With theMideast situation, there's a lot of things happening with theM-16.''</TEXT></DOC>
