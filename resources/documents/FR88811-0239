The proposed action consists of the construction of anexpressway on new location. One EIS will discuss the proposed relocationof US 64 from US 258 in Tarboro to near SR 1302 west of Robersonville,a distance of approximately 13 miles. The other EIS will discuss the proposedrelocation of US 64 from near SR 1302 west of Robersonville to existingUS 64 east of Williamston, a distance of approximately 15 miles. The proposedprojects are needed to serve traffic demand in the area. They will providea much needed alternative route for US 64 traffic and will relieve thecongestion, delay, and inconvenience currently being experienced alongthis highway by removing through traffic from the existing facility. Theproposed relation of US 64 will bypass the towns of Tarboro, Princeville,and Conetoe in Edgecombe County, Bethel in Pitt County, and Parmele, Robersonville,Everetts, and Williamston in Martin County. Alternatives under consideration include (1) the ``no-build'', (2) improvingexisting US 64, and (3) the construction of an expressway on new location.Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments are beingsent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies.
