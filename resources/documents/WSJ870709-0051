The Minneapolis concern, the world's largest producer of plastic bank and credit cards, said the delay, from July 23, is to allow updating proxies to include new information on Deluxe Check Printers Inc.'s pending sale of 38% of DataCard's stock to National Computer Systems Inc. for $45 million. DataCard has said the $12-a-share price for the stake is &quot;way too low.&quot; It has formed a special committee to investigate alternatives to the sale of the stake, including a sale of the company, a leveraged buyout, and a restructuring. A spokesman for National Computer, a Minneapolis maker of computer scanning products, said the delay was &quot;not surprising.&quot; Deluxe, St. Paul, Minn., the nation's largest check printer, declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
