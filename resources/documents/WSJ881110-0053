Check out the battle between Wall Street traders over where copper and its producers' stock prices are headed.    The metal's breathtaking two-month, 53% price rally has spawned an unusual clash, with raging bulls and bitter bears swapping thinly veiled charges of slander and price manipulation.    The chasm between the two sides is shown by the wide range in estimates of copper's price outlook.    At Thomson McKinnon, analyst George Anagnos expects a gain of between 30 cents and 35 cents a pound in the next few months. Yet Dean Witter's longtime copper analyst, J. Clarence Morrison, sees copper prices averaging just 85 cents next year, fully 30 cents a pound below his estimated 1988 average. (Copper yesterday spurted up 3.30 cents for the nearby futures contract to settle at $1.52 a pound.)    The bears insist that currently tight copper supply conditions are a fluke.    They rattle off a host of one-time problems: a &quot;freak&quot; shifting of rock that caused cave-ins at Chile's biggest mine early this year; a sudden encounter with lower-grade ore by Chilean miners; fear of AIDS that has driven crucial Belgian mining engineers out of Zambia; labor unrest in Peru, and misguided purchasing practices by U.S. industrial customers wedded to the computer-based &quot;just in time&quot; system of inventory management.    Just-in-time inventory delivery swept into favor among U.S. factories in the 1980s because it slashes the expense of carrying raw materials. Relying on precise data from computers, the companies buy inventory on virtually no notice and under contracts that force them to pay a premium over the spot price. That system has artificially buoyed spot prices for copper, some people believe.    Widespread use of just-in-time purchasing by industrial buyers of copper both initiated and helped sustain the metal's recent price run-up, contends Simon D. Strauss, a retired Asarco vice chairman who now works as a consultant to both copper producers and users.    Meanwhile, the copper bears have been burned badly. For the first eight months of this year, near-term futures contracts traded in a range of about 85 cents to $1.15 a pound. They they took off from about the $1 level early in September, climbing above $1.50 in recent weeks.    &quot;Some of my most sophisticated clients have been going short and getting clobbered since the spring&quot; by betting on a copper-price drop, says a Wall Street broker. &quot;They still can't believe their eyes.&quot;    Partly because of the skepticism over the outlook, stock prices of the four publicly traded copper producers haven't risen anywhere near as much as the copper price during this fall's 53% run-up. Phelps Dodge is ahead 21% since Aug. 31 and Magma Copper has risen 23%. Asarco and Cyprus Minerals have advanced 13% and 14%, respectively.    U.S. trade sources say they've been seeing a slight easing in price pressure as more copper has come onto the market in recent days. Futures-market users, too, seem to be showing little fear of a continued price advance.    Normally, the longer the time until a futures contract expires, the higher its price will be. That's because the futures price reflects two main components -- the spot price of the commodity, and the carrying cost of money used to buy that commodity over the term of the contract.    However, at the Commodity Exchange in New York these days, copper-contract prices are arrayed in an abnormal, reverse pattern that traders call &quot;backwardation.&quot; Thus, while buyers in the Comex copper pit yesterday paid $1.52 a pound for the contract that expires this month, they paid but $1.0555 a pound for the contract that expires more than a year from now, in December 1989. This suggests traders still aren't sufficiently worried about prices a year from now to drive up the distant contract.    The tight-supply situation cropped up last year almost overnight. Warehouse inventories of the world's two leading copper markets -- the London Metal Exchange and New York's Comex -- had been whittled away by a combined total of 600,000 tons between 1983 and the third quarter of 1987, Mr. Strauss says.    &quot;Yet the copper price didn't budge&quot; from a deeply depressed range of 60 cents to 70 cents a pound, he says. &quot;Buyers kept acting like there were growing surpluses.&quot; Working with the industry's usual supply contracts, which call for buyers to pay the spot price in effect at the time of delivery, &quot;They just kept calling up the producers and telling them to ship the copper they needed the next day.&quot;    But suddenly in the middle of last year's third quarter, &quot;the producers had to start saying, 'Sorry, but we don't have any copper to send you,'&quot; Mr. Strauss relates. &quot;That started the price run-up,&quot; and continued use of the just-in-time inventory system this year has kept upward pressure on the spot price.    Lately, at least one person has begun quietly suggesting that another, sinister factor is also fueling the price run-up. This skeptic, a seasoned Wall Street metals analyst, whispers that some shadowy OPEC-like cabal, involving investors and/or producers, may be holding copper off the market.    &quot;Somehow, between the second and third quarter, between 250,000 and 275,000 tons of copper concentrates simply disappeared from the processing stream,&quot; he says. &quot;That's about all it took&quot; to keep the copper price skyrocketing, he says.    &quot;That much concentrate isn't easy to hide,&quot; the analyst adds. &quot;Some producers would have to be cooperating&quot; in such a scheme. And the recent rapid build-up in the number of futures contracts to buy copper suggests a well-financed speculative binge &quot;that would be consistent with knowledge that copper is being held off the market.&quot;    So naturally, this analyst will soon expose the whole sordid affair in a report to his firm's clients, right? Well, not exactly. &quot;I can't afford to alienate the producers,&quot; he says. &quot;And if I open the subject my clients will be mad, too, unless I can tell them who it is.&quot;    Such suggestions infuriate producers. &quot;We're producing every pound of copper we can and selling every pound we produce,&quot; retorts G. Robert &quot;Bull&quot; Durham, the assertive chief executive officer at Phelps Dodge, based in Phoeniz, Ariz. &quot;That's the kind of theory you'd expect from an analyst who's been wrong about copper for a year and is looking for a scapegoat. I challenge you to come out here and find a single pound of that copper he's talking about.&quot;    As Mr. Durham and other bulls see it, the copper-price surge reflects nothing more mystifying than a continued, steady 1%-a-year growth in world demand, a pace that producers recently haven't matched. Surging industrial growth outside the U.S., especially among Pacific Rim nations, seems likely to keep demand for copper strong regardless of whether the U.S. economy slips into the late 1989 recession that most copper bears are predicting.    This prospect raises the broader question of how investors should react if the U.S. falls into recession and industry relies increasingly on export sales to vibrant economies abroad.    One investment maxim holds that industrial commodities such as copper -- and stocks of producers -- ought to be sold now, with the U.S. economic expansion showing signs of topping out. But if the copper bulls are right about the growth of foreign demand, now might be the time to buy these shares.    When it comes to the outlook for the red metal's price, the skeptics seem to have won a lot of hearts on Wall Street, restraining recent growth in share prices. And not even the bulls expect the price to run up indefinitely.    Phelps Dodge's Mr. Durham, for one, expects that the current price and the eventual solution of production problems in South America and Africa will bring more copper onto the market. This may well moderate prices, he suggests.    But don't expect to see cheap copper again, he warns. Mr. Durham doesn't see &quot;any reason why the copper price should ever go below $1 a pound. Why, it's been at that level or better (in current dollars) for 32 of the past 40 years,&quot; he says.    And any consumers who might be tempted to trim future costs with a fixed-price contract can forget it. Phelps Dodge has &quot;no interest in supplying copper under a fixed-price contract.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
