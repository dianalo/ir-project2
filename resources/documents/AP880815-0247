(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For Jeremy Rifkin, the combat againstbiotechnology is the latest in a series of battles that have helpedshape a varied life and career. He's fought tougher.   He was born weighing 2{ pounds.   His birth, midway through the sixth month of Vivette Rifkin'spregnancy, wasn't the only surprise. Mrs. Rifkin was about to bewheeled out of the delivery room when a doctor detected a secondbaby.   ``Our chances of survival were something like zero,'' saysRifkin. Other than being smaller than most high school freshmen,and the occasional schoolyard thrashings that went with it, hesuffered no permanent ill effects.   Jerelyn Rifkin was less fortunate. An error in regulating theflow of oxygen to her incubator robbed her of most of her sight.Now married and a mother of three, she remains legally blind,although ``she does everything everyone else does,'' says herbrother. ``She's probably the best-adjusted person in my family.''   Her daughter's handicap inspired Vivette Rifkin to foundEducational Tape Recording for the Blind, a volunteer organizationnow in its 20th year of recording textbooks for blind students. At77, she still works a seven-day week as its president. MiltonRifkin is retired from his job as a plastic bag manufacturer.They've lived in the same house for 43 years, in a working-classneighborhood on the south side of Chicago.   Growing up with a handicapped twin prompted Rifkin to give agreat deal of thought at an early age to weighty social issues. Hestill does.   ``In this society, the highest compliment is to turn outgenerations of productive human beings. You have to haveproductivity, of course. But a lot of us grow up believing thehighest value is to be productive, like a machine is productive,''he says.   ``That does a disservice. What matters most is to turn outcaring human beings, people who have the higher value of empathy.''   By the time he graduated from high school, about the time hefinally caught up to his classmates, Rifkin had come to believethat an ordinary person can accomplish extraordinary things, anotion reinforced by his acceptance, despite flunking high schoolEnglish, to an Ivy League college. Twenty-five years and nine bookslater, he says, ``I still can't tell you which is the adverb.''   As a beer-drinking fraternity man at the University ofPennsylvania, he was ``very rah-rah, a cheerleader,'' says NealBorenstein, his college roommate.   Rifkin was ``never enthralled with high-tech,'' adds hisroommate. When most college kids were preoccupied with rock music,Rifkin was busy organizing a nostalgia show of '50s kiddieprograms. Even then, his organizational skills were impressive:``He filled the auditorium, and the show was a huge success.''   His politics took a sharp turn to the left in 1966, when aVietnamese history course ``didn't square with what they weresaying on TV.''   The following year, he made waves nationwide as the first seniorclass president of an Ivy League college to publicly denounce thewar. After graduation, he attended the Fletcher School of Law andDiplomacy at Tufts, then became a VISTA volunteer in New York,working with welfare recipients in Bedford-Stuyvesant and EastHarlem.   During the '70s, he organized the People's BicentennialCommission, ``an alternative to Nixon's Tory celebrations,'' hesays. The commission held rallies for ``economic democracy'' andchurned out classroom materials celebrating the nation'srevolutionary past.   By 1977, Rifkin had found his next cause in the controversy overrecombinant DNA technology, the subject of his new book, ``WhoShould Play God.'' The same year, he led protesters in disrupting aNational Academy of Sciences meeting on DNA research, chanting ``Wewill not be cloned.''   In the years since, both Rifkin's techniques and his targetshave grown more complex. These days, in addition to campaignsagainst animal patenting, biological warfare and surrogacy, anotherform of tinkering with life, he's preparing a global boycott ofmilk treated with bovine growth hormone, a Greenhouse EffectCoalition and ``we'd like to move big on electronic pollution.''   For all his public pronouncements on technology's ills, ``I'mnot a purist,'' Rifkin concedes. He owns a condo, drives a Honda,and is a faithful viewer of ``thirtysomething'' and ``Cheers.''   He's clearly proud of the favorable reviews he's receiving forhis college speaking engagements (Yale University called him ``arare bird _ a first-rate speaker and a first-rate writer''). At thesame time, no amount of criticism directed at him or his politicsseems to faze him.   ``I've known him a long time,'' says Ralph Nader, who has lentsupport to Rifkin's campaign against animal patenting. ``He's verydetermined, very sincere, and he's on the issue for the long run.''   ``I'm an average person with an average background,'' saysRifkin, who believes average people are quite capable of changinghistory.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
