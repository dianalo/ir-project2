(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The populaton of black-footed ferrets,once believed extinct is growing in captive breeding and eventuallythe animals will be set free in Wyoming's high plains.   This week the state Game and Fish Department is holding hearingsin Meeteetse, Cody and Casper to discuss a reintroduction plan thatcould see the first of the small, masked mammals released into thewild by 1991.   Four years ago, an epidemic of canine distemper nearly wiped outthe only known colony of the nocturnal, weasel-like creatures, andwildlife biologists trapped the last 18 for a captive breedingprogram.   The program centered at the department's Sybille Canyon facilityhas boosted the known population of ferrets to some 120.   This week's hearings will draw public comment on plans to returnsome of the ferrets to the plains surrounding Meeteetse, where theywere found in 1981 after being considered extinct.   ``It's only right,'' said town recreation director Jim Sessions,who keeps in his office Meeteetse's only remaining black-footedferret _ stuffed.   But some objectives must be met before reintroduction.   Scientists are working on a vaccine to immunize the animalsagainst distemper, said Tom Thorne, a state veterinarian whodirected the breeding project.   And the ferrets must be taught how to kill prairie dogs, theirnatural prey. To help the animals learn, Game and Fish has builtcaged, outdoor prairie dog colonies.   But there's no fear that captive-bred ferrets won't recognizepredators that can kill them, said Thorne.   ``If anything, they are wilder and more afraid of us than thewild-caught ferrets,'' he said. ``My hope is that they're going toregard everything except prairie dogs as a predator.''   Critics worry that human activity _ particularly the area'sranching and oil industries _ will be a bigger problem.   Exxon has proposed drilling a well a few miles from prime ferrethabitat, and a public hearing on that proposal is scheduledThursday in Meeteetse.   But Pitchfork Ranch manager Jack Turnell, 43, a member of anadvisory board on the ferret program, said he has ``zero concern''about drilling.   ``The ferret doesn't give a damn about people or machinery orcattle or anything else,'' said Turnell. ``There's only one thingthey care about _ that's a food source.''   Turnell said scientists want him to persuade other ranchers tolet ferrets be introduced into prairie dog towns on their ranches.   But the ranchers are afraid, ``not of ferrets, but ofbureaucrats and environmentalists because they go overboard withtheir rules and regulations,'' he said.   Wildlife officials hope to ease that fear by having thereintroduced ferrets declared a ``non-essential experimentalpopulation'' under the Endangered Species Act. That would liftrestrictions that protect every individual of a threatened speciesand reduce bureaucratic reaction to ferret deaths.</TEXT></DOC>
