Sincemost of the plant constructions are now complete, the focus is on improvementof the performance of operating nuclear power plants. It is relativelyeasy to identify all the problems, regulatory driven or otherwise, thatneed to be solved to improve performance. What is much more difficultis to prioritize the problems and select solutions that have a proventrack record, such that a utility has a high degree of assurance on boththe cost/benefit analysis and the success of the proposed modifications.Standardization of plant improvements is one way of reaching this goal.This paper proposes a detailed organizational model that engineer/constructorscan use to develop such improvements.</TEXT></DOC>
