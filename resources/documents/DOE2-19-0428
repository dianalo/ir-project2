Results from scanning-electron-microscopycharacterization, x-ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric analysis,the temperature dependence of the resistivity, and temperature dependenceof the magnetic susceptibility are presented. The samples with T/subc/ greater than 50 K are orthorhombic while samples with T/sub c/ lessthan 50 K show tetragonal structure. The transition temperature is foundto depend on the oxygen content x with an apparent peak near x = 7. Oursample with the highest T/sub c/ (72 K) had x = 6.75. As x decreases,so does T/sub c/, reaching 44 K when x = 6.47. For oxygen content greaterthan 7, T/sub c/ decreases rapidly to a value of 23 K when x = 7.27.The room-temperature resistivity increases systematically from 0.8 to7.9 m{Omega} cm as T/sub c/ decreases from 72 to 27 K. The increase isresistivity in the normal state and the decrease in the resistivity ratio(rho/sub 300 K//rho/sub residual/ are interpreted in terms of disorderin the microscopic structure which suppresses T/sub c/. The magneticsusceptibility of these samples separates into a Pauli susceptibilitychi{sub 0} and a Curie-Weiss susceptibility C/(T-FTHETA), after the corecontribution is subtracted. A systematic increase in chi{sub 0} and adecrease in the Curie constant C has been observed as T/sub c/ variesfrom 23 to 72 K.</TEXT></DOC>
