Since nearly all businesses in the Soviet Union aregovernment-owned, the budget includes most of the capitalinvestment projects in the country.   The official Tass news agency report did not say if VladimirPanskov, a deputy finance minister, detailed the defense cuts inhis testimony to a committee of the Supreme Soviet legislature.   Soviet officials said earlier this week they planned to trim thedefense budget from $119 billion this year to $109 billion in 1990as part of a planned 14 percent cut in military spending by 1991.   Separately, Gen. Anatoly Shabanov told Tass that projectedmilitary spending cuts would save the Soviet Union $46 billion. Butthe report did not say when that budget reduction would occur. Nordid it say if he was counting from the current budget or fromonce-projected increases.   Shabanov also said the military will shift to the civilianeconomy 45,000 pieces of major equipment in 1989 and 1990,including trucks, earthmovers and telephone facilities. He said theamount to be transferred by the army this year is valued at $774million.   Legislators continued debating the budget in Supreme Sovietcommittees Thursday. Alexander Orlov from the Ural Mountainscriticized the $155 billion food subsidies, Tass said. Orlovsuggested such funds would be better spent improving agriculturalefficiency.   The committee on law added a clause to a strike bill that saysonly the Supreme Soviet or its parent body, the Congress ofPeople's Deputies, would have the power to ban strikes. That panelalso debated a blanket prohibition on strikes in certain areas ofthe economy but came to no decision, Tass said.</TEXT></DOC>
