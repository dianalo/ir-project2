Licenses SmithKline to Make Hepatitis B Vaccine </HL><SO> </SO><CO> BGENF SKB MRK </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Biogen N.V. said it licensed a unit of SmithKline Beckman Corp. to make and sell genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine products in the U.S. and other countries, except Japan.    The licensing appears likely to set up a legal battle between SmithKline and Biogen against Merck andamp; Co., Rahway, N.J., the only company now selling a genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine in the U.S. Biogen has said its patent, granted in December 1987, is broad enough to cover any genetically engineered hepatitis B antigens. Biogen had applied for the patent in 1979, based on work by one of its directors. Merck also makes and sells a hepatitis B vaccine derived from blood; it is the only company in the U.S. to do so.    Merck said yesterday that it is &quot;confident of its patent position&quot; and of its ability to continue selling the genetically engineered vaccine. Biogen said it had negotiated with Merck before deciding to grant the license to Philadelphia-based SmithKline.    SmithKline has been making a genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine in Belgium since 1986. Last December, the U.S. patent office granted a broad patent on genetically engineered hepatitis B products to Biogen.    James Vincent, Biogen's chairman and chief executive officer, said that &quot;this contract is an important step in the improving revenue base for Biogen.&quot; He declined to give details of the SmithKline agreement, but said that over the next three years, Biogen expects to receive $20 million to $40 million in revenue from hepatitis B licenses.    The revenue will be welcome. Last year Biogen, a genetic engineering company, reported a net loss of $22.6 million on revenue of $12.5 million.    Biogen made the announcement after the market closed. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Biogen shares closed at $5.75, down 12.5 cents. In New York Stock Exchange trading, SmithKline shares closed at $53, down 25 cents. Merck closed at $156, down $1. </TEXT></DOC>
