Dan Meridor's suggestion is among tougher measures to handle the18-month uprising proposed by Israeli officials and criticized bythe United States and human rights organizations.   ``I think deportation is serious but must be used, I would sayperhaps even more that what has been done until now,'' Meridor toldarmy radio.   ``I think it's an effective punishment when we have appropriateevidence,'' he said.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has recommended speeding updeportation procedures as well as demolishing more homes ofPalestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities and lengtheningthe term security suspects can be detained without trial from sixmonths to one year.   Washington and human rights organizations say all three methodsignore international conventions on the treatment of people inoccupied lands and violate due process of law because suspects haveno chance to go to court.   The justice and defense ministries Sunday set up a jointcommittee to devise tougher measures to put down the uprising.   Meridor told the radio about 50 Palestinians have been deportedsince the start of the uprising and nearly 300 houses have beendemolished or sealed.   Also Monday, the body of a woman suspected of cooperating withIsraeli authorities was found in the West Bank city of Nablus, Arabreports said. She had been beaten to death, they said.   Palestinians said Sabah Khadi Kanaan, 30, had been accused ofcollaborating with Israel's secret police, but an army spokesmansaid police believe the killing was criminal.   Ms. Kanaan was the 68th suspected collaborator killed byPalestinians since the uprising began in December 1987. The unresthas killed 536 Palestinians and 23 Israelis.   A suspected collaborator killed Sunday initially was identifiedby Arab reporters as Nidal Salhab, 21, but police Monday saidSalhab's father reported his son was alive. The victim's head hadbeen crushed, and police said they still are trying to determine hisidentity.   Meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said Israel must presenta united front on its peace plan.   ``Though it may be difficult and painful, Israel must declare anddemonstrate to one and all, friendly and unfriendly, that she is notdivided and that her mission of peace is sincere and real,'' Inouyesaid, speaking at a Hebrew University graduation ceremony.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has proposed holding elections inthe occupied lands to select Palestinian representatives to opennegotiations on an interim peace agreement with Israel.   Hard-liners in his right-wing Likud bloc oppose the plan, sayingit could lead to formation of a Palestinian state.   Inouye also said the United States should stand behind Israel.   ``This is a time of testing for America and Israel, testingwhether we are prepared to take this important step in the pathwaysof peace, and we must not fail,'' Inouye said.</TEXT></DOC>
