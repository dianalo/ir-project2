If the funding is positive, section 4(b)(3)also requires prompt commencement of a review of the status of the involvedspecies. The Service now announces a 90-day finding on a recently receivedpetition. The petition was submitted jointly by the Humane Society of the UnitedStates, Animal Welfare Institute, International Wildlife coalition, AnimalProtection Institute, Society for Animal Protective Legislation, and Friendsof Animals, Inc. An additional 32 organizations were listed as supportingand joining in the petition. It is dated February 16, 1989, and was receivedby the Service on the same date. It requests that the classification ofthe African elephant (<T3>Loxodonta africana</T3>) on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlifebe changed from threatened to endangered.The petition, and other information available to the Service, indicatesthat the status of the African elephant has deteriorated substantiallysince the species was originally classified as threatened in 1978. Thereare several serious problems, but the most critical immediate factors inthe situation are intensive poaching to obtain elephant ivory and subsequentinternational trade of this product. In 1978 the species was estimatedto number about 1,500,000 individuals. Regulatory measures implementedthen and subsequently by the United Sates, other nations, and the conventionon International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora havenot been successful in arresting the decline. By 1987 the number of elephantshad fallen to about 764,000, according to the African Elephant and RhinoSpecialist Group of the International Union for conservation of Natureand Natural Resources. The most informed current estimates are between550,000 and 700,000.The Service has examined the petition and has found it to present substantialinformation indicating that the requested action may be warranted. Therefore,a review of the status of the African elephant is initiated herewith. TheService will consider the comments received, along with all other availabledata, in making a finding, required by section 4(b)(3) within 12 monthsof receipt of a petition presenting substantial information, as to whetherthe requested action is warranted, not warranted, or warranted but precludedby other listing activity.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> The authority for this action is the Endangered SpeciesAct (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>; Pub.
