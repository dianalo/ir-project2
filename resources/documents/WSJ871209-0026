Nonetheless, the steelmaker said the gain will be partly offset by an unspecified charge from fresh additions to its loss reserves for discontinued insurance operations. The company wouldn't elaborate.    Armco said the court ruled in April that the company was entitled to refunds of overpaid taxes from returns in 1976 and 1977, plus accrued interest. As a result of the ruling, Armco said, it was able to claim for other years and file amended returns for 1973 through 1982 to recoup the $63 million.    Armco said it may seek refunds of some state taxes it paid during those years.    Earlier this month, Armco said it would take a $73 million charge in the quarter from the closing of some steelmaking operations and realize a $58 million gain from the sale of its stake in a nickel mine.    The company said it expects to post a profit for the fourth quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Armco earned $34.6 million, or 49 cents a share, on sales of $668.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
