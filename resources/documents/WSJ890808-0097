Geodyne, based here, said it is purchasing the properties, primarily interests in natural gas wells in southern Texas and northwestern New Mexico, on behalf of oil and gas partnerships it sponsors.    Consolidated, an operating unit of Consolidated Energy Partners L.P., said last month that it and its parent company plan to liquidate their assets by Oct. 31 to repay about $40 million in bank debt. Consolidated said the oil and gas properties represent at least 80% of its assets, leaving it with scattered oil and gas properties. </TEXT></DOC>
