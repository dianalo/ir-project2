The new forecast compared with the 3 percent to 5 percent pricehike the department has been predicting for 1990 since December.   Double-digit price gains in the first half of this year forfresh fruits, pork, eggs and dairy products, along with``uncertainties about future energy prices,'' are mostly to blamefor the upward revision, said the department's Economic ResearchService.   ``However, most of the year's price increases probably tookplace in the first half,'' the agency said Friday. ``Gains in thesecond half are expected to be more modest.''   But the report added that this assumes most of the evolving oilprice shock will take until next year to spill over into thegrocery store.   Retail food prices rose an average of 5.8 percent in 1989, thesharpest year-to-year increase since 1981. Much of that gain wasfallout from the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation.   One USDA official who spoke only on condition of anonymity saidthat without the Mideast crisis and rising energy costs, the newfood price estimate for 1990 would have been in the range of 5percent to 6 percent.   Thus, the official said, an allowance of only one percentagepoint was made at the upper end of the estimate to allow for higheroil prices.   Further, the source said, some department analysts had wanted tohold the new 1990 food price increase to less than what wasdecided. Most felt the oil pinch is not going to hit this year, thesource said.</TEXT><HEAD>Commerce Department: Taiwan Dumping Cheap Sweaters in U.S.</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sweaters made of manmade fibers in Taiwan arebeing sold in the United States at less than fair market value, theCommerce Department says.   The National Knitwear andamp; Sportswear Association in New York hadfiled complaints last September against sweater manufacturers inSouth Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.   The department said Friday it ruled against the manufacturers inHong Kong on July 21 and against those in South Korea on Aug. 3.   The findings clear the way for the International TradeCommission to determine whether the products are harming U.S.industry. If the commission finds U.S. firms are being damaged, thegovernment can impose duties on the imports to make their pricescomparable to those of U.S. companies.   The department said the imports represent 72 percent of the $1.3billion U.S. market and the three countries represent 55 percent ofthe imports. It said the value of the sweaters imported from SouthKorea in 1989 was $476.1 million; from Hong Kong, $208.8 million,and Taiwan, $485.5 million.   The department said the imports are made predominantly ofacrylic fiber. Sweaters containing at least 23 percent wool areexcluded.</TEXT><HEAD>Local Review Beginning in 1990 Census</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Local officials across the country arebeginning to receive preliminary housing counts, the Census Bureaureports.   Official population numbers won't be issued until at least theend of the year, though preliminary ones will be sent to stateofficials within a few weeks.   The early housing reports are designed to allow localgovernments to challenge the Bureau's findings, pointing out areaswhere homes and people may have been missed, officials said.   The census got under way in March with the mailing of nearly 100million forms. In recent weeks workers have been going door-to-doorto try to count people who were missed in the first phase.   Sending the preliminary count to local officials does not meanthat the effort is complete, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryantsaid.   The figures are open to challenge and workers will be sent outto double-check areas where officials question the totals.   In addition to sending housing counts to city, county and townofficials, preliminary population counts will be sent to stategovernors, state redistricting officials and members of Congresswho has requested the information.</TEXT></DOC>
