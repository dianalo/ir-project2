(cases).andO;Topic:     Computer CrimeSystem Crash.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Richard MarchandM;For more than four months, the PC network at Marshall Williams' office hadbeen crashing and losing data.andP;  When the police arrested him in connectionwith the crashes, he was stunned.andM;Now, more than a year later, Williams faces a felony charge of accessing acomputer for fraudulent means, a charge that could put him in prison for 15years if convicted.andM;&quot;What they're accusing me of is impossible,&quot; said Williams, who pleaded notguilty last month and is expected to stand trial this summer in Clarke CountySuperior Court in Athens, Ga.andP;  &quot;This is something out of the Twilight Zone.&quot;andM;The unique case is raising public-policy issues that experts say could becomeincreasingly common as computers and networks proliferate in U.S.andP;  companies.andO;At issue is who is liable when a system crashes and data is lost: the user,the installer, the vendor or the employer.andM;Although cases involving computer experts who tamper with systems have becomemore common, Williams' case is believed to be the first involving a user whoclaims innocence based on technical ignorance.andP;  Williams said he has &quot;neverheard&quot; of the Xenix operating system that ran the network, an Altos ComputerSystems model 986 PC acting as a server for six terminals.andM;Henry O'Pry, the owner of Southeastern Color Lithographers Inc., an Athens,Ga., printing and advertising firm where Williams worked as a cost estimator,said he initially didn't believe an employee could be the problem.andP;  But afterspending thousands of dollars on tests and replacement parts, O'Pry contends,the cause of the problem was traced to Williams' terminal.andM;&quot;It was a willful act,&quot; said O'Pry, who claims the lost data nearly sent hisfirm into bankruptcy.andM;Law experts say the prosecution's biggest challenge will be to prove thatWilliams acted knowingly, willfully and without authorization.andM;Without this legal safeguard, employees everywhere could become scapegoatsfor hardware or software problems.andM;Passing the BuckandM;&quot;Buck-passing is a common occurrence,&quot; said Michael Covington, a researcherat the University of Georgia Computer Center in Athens.andP;  &quot;I don't wantcomputer sabotage to be used to cover up software or hardware defects.&quot;andM;Ann Branscomb, a Cambridge, Mass., lawyer and researcher at HarvardUniversity's program on information resources policy, agrees.andP;  &quot;One of theconcerns about the laws is that they do not pick up innocent people makingerrors,&quot; she said.andM;Regardless of who is to blame, employers still run the risk of catastrophiclosses caused by system crashes and erased data.andP;  O'Pry estimates the lostdata cost him more than $440,000, not including the cost of frustration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
