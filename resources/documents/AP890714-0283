(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A retired Navy engineer Friday admittedtaking $475,000 in bribes from two major defense contractors as heand four other people pleaded guilty in the widening Pentagonprocurement fraud probe.   Garland L. Tomlin Jr., 59, admitted taking $400,000 from SperryCorp. and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc. in exchange for confidentialbid information about a multimillion-dollar contract to maintain theelectronic components of Navy weapons.   The money was paid between 1982 and 1984 into a bank account thatTomlin kept in the Bahamas in the name of a dummy corporation he setup to receive the funds. Tomlin later transferred $400,000 to aSwiss bank, according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court.   Another former Navy engineer, Jerry L. Manning, 52, pleadedguilty to a bribery conspiracy charge, admitting that he gave adefense consultant bid information about a $20 million Navyelectronics contract.   In addition, two defense consultants and a former marketingmanager for Unisys Corp., the successor to Sperry Corp., pleadedguilty to separate charges relating to a scheme to conceal illegalcampaign contributions to several congressmen, including Rep LesAspin, D-Wisc., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.   There was no indication that Aspin or any of the othercongressmen who received donations knew the contributions wereillegally funneled to them by Sperry through defense consultants.   All five defendants agreed to cooperate with the JusticeDepartment's continuing investigation of Pentagon procurement fraudthat has been nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''   Tomlin, who was a program engineer at the Navy's Space and NavalWarfare Systems Command until his retirement in 1985, is the thirdformer Pentagon official to admit taking bribes.   He pleaded guilty to conspiracy, receiving bribes and taxevasion, charges that are punishable by a maximum sentence of 25years and a $130,000 fine.   Evidence that two major contractors paid Tomlin $475,000 inbribes ``shows a disturbing pattern'' in the nation's defenseindustry, U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson told reporters outside theU.S. Courthouse here.   Hudson acknowledged that investigators were unaware of Tomlinuntil a former Unisys Corp. official and a consultant for thecompany pleaded guilty last March and began cooperating with theprobe.   ``We do not have information that enables us to comment at thistime.'' said Honeywell spokeswoman Sylvia Burgos Wander.   ``There isn't anybody that would be involved in that thing thathasn't been thrown out the door or disciplined,'' said Peter Hynes,a spokesman for Unisys, which was formed in 1986 when BurroughsCorp. acquired Sperry.   According to court papers, Tomlin, who now lives near Orlando,Fla., demanded $500,000 from Sperry Corp. in return for hisinfluence in helping the company obtain lucrative contracts forcomputerized maintenance of electronic weapons components.   The court papers revealed that the bribery arrangement wasapproved by an unidentified high-ranking official of Sperry Corp.and was also known to an executive at the company's Clearwater,Fla., electronics plant.   The Clearwater executive told Charles F. Gardner, then a Sperryvice president in charge of the company's Surveillance and FireControl Systems Division in Great Neck, N.Y., that Tomlin was readyto retire and ``wanted a nest egg.''   Gardner, who pleaded guilty to an unrelated bribery charge inMarch, obtained approval of the arrangement to pay Tomlin from hissuperior.   Former Unisys marketing manager Dennis Mitchell, 42, pleadedguilty to participating in a scheme to pay $4,000 in illegalcorporate campaign contributions to Aspin and other House members.   Mitchell, who worked with Gardner, admitted directing privateconsultants to make the contributions as individuals with money theywere paid by Unisys.   Unisys consultants Joseph S. Zuba, 67, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., andGerard J. Scarano, 74, admitted participating in the scheme toconceal the illegal donations.   Contributions were also made to Reps. Bob Roe, D-N.J., BillYoung, D-Fla., George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y. as well as former Rep.Robert Badham, R-Calif. and the late Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla.,according to court papers.   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled sentencings for thefive defendants for Sept. 29.</TEXT></DOC>
