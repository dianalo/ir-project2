A generation after John Kennedy, the makeup of the American electorate has changed as dramatically as the political process that will select the next president. Political scientists are divided on how to interpret these changes, but the contrast between 1960 and today is illuminating in trying to understand forces at play in next year's election.    Much has been made of the historic parallels between the contests of 1960 and 1988. Both parties again compete to succeed an aging Republican forbidden to succeed himself. A new Soviet leader captures the headlines, and if America once worried about Sputnik, a central political reality today is concern about falling further behind in the world economy.    &quot;The similarities are there,&quot; says political scientist Thomas Mann. &quot;But how are we different?&quot;    Population shifts have redistributed power within states and between regions. Far-reaching social and economic changes have altered voter turnout and loyalties. Blacks and women are more equitably represented, but as old divisions have narrowed, new ones appear.    On the surface, at least, Republicans should benefit in 1988. Many traditional elements of the Democratic coalition -- unions, the big-city vote -- have grown weaker or dispersed since 1960, when Mr. Kennedy eked out the narrowest of victories over Republican Richard Nixon. At the same time, however, party loyalty has fallen toward both parties since 1960, while new voting constituencies -- economically independent working women, for instance -- have emerged. So the ultimate bottom line may be that Republicans and Democrats alike face greater difficulty in building a majority.    A review of census data and voter surveys indicates that class differences are more pronounced among the younger half of the electorate. College graduates are more attuned to an increasingly white-collar, international economy, even as less educated, blue-collar workers have dropped out in disproportionate numbers from the political system.    &quot;The American social structure has fundamentally changed to one formed by knowledge and level of education rather than ownership of land and machinery or institutional ties such as unions,&quot; says Ralph Whitehead of the University of Massachusetts. &quot;This new social structure is far more advanced in the younger half of the electorate, the first post-industrial generation.&quot;    More broadly, the decline in loyalty to political parties since 1960 coincides with a wider social &quot;de-alignment.&quot; Unions and churches claim a smaller share of the population than in 1960. Marriages are later. Children are fewer, divorces more frequent. When Mr. Kennedy -- then 43 years old -- was elected, the odds of a man his age being single or divorced were 1 in 10. By 1985, the chances were 1 in 5.    Some of the most striking changes are in areas where new opportunities in education and the economy have intensified competition and fostered new elites. Between 1960 and 1984, the percentage of the population over age 25 with a college degree more than doubled -- a development that has also further isolated younger men who stayed at the high school level.    Their earnings have fallen significantly behind those going to college, and at the ballot box they vote in far fewer numbers both than the high-school graduates of the generation that elected Mr. Kennedy and their own better-educated contemporaries. According to census data from the 1964 election, college graduates of ages 25 to 44 turned out to vote at a rate only 13% higher than that for high-school-educated men of the same age; in 1984, the gap had widened to 57%.    Put another way, if that gap was closed and the relationship between the turnout rates returned to what it was in the 1960s, it would add some 1.3 million ballots to the election -- better than 10 times Mr. Kennedy's margin of a victory, and just a few hundred thousand less than Jimmy Carter's victory margin the last time the Democrats won the White House.    The broad shift from blue-collar jobs began well before 1960, but it has since been combined with women entering the work force in unprecedented numbers. From 1972 to 1986, for example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a net increase of 27.4 million new jobs, most of them white-collar and nearly two-thirds going to women.    More than half of all married women are now counted in the work force, compared with less than one in three in 1960. Their earnings serve to protect the declining share of income going to middle-class families, but those households with one or no earner are left at a disadvantage. Among the most affluent American families, economist Frank Levy writes in &quot;Dollars and Dreams,&quot; three in five are two-wage-earner households. Among the least affluent, almost half have no earner at all.    Just as women offer the potential of new income for families, they -- and their children -- have also come to symbolize the new face of poverty. The number of households headed by women alone doubled to 10.1 million between 1960 and 1985. An estimated 15.5% of white children under 18 years were living only with their mother in 1985. The percentage is more than three times as high among blacks.    These changes coincide with a significant increase in the proportion of votes cast by women. While total voter turnout has declined significantly since 1960, the gap between men and women has closed over the same period to a point where census figures show women outvoting men in recent elections. This shift is concentrated among the younger half of the electorate; in 1984, the turnout rate among black women between 25 and 44 years was as much as 20% higher than for black men of the same age.    Social changes are a motivating factor, but more important may be the influence of economics. Polls indicate the new single-woman-headed households contribute to the &quot;gender gap&quot; seen in recent elections. And an analysis by Rutgers University political scientist Susan Carroll suggests that, regardless of background, women who are economically independent of men tend to vote differently than men.    Citing voter surveys, her figures show that single women and those in managerial and professional jobs with college education supported Ronald Reagan at a rate 19% below men in 1980. By comparison, less economically independent women -- homemakers, for instance, or less-educated working wives in lower-paid, non-professional jobs -- voted for Mr. Reagan at rates much closer to men.    These changes within the population coincide with major shifts in how voters are distributed across the country. Electoral votes have shifted to the West and South. California alone has gained 15 electoral votes since 1960. The South has nearly 8% more electoral votes than in 1960, thanks almost entirely to rapid growth in Texas and Florida -- growth that only underscores the economic disparities within the South itself.    Meanwhile, the well-documented decline of big-city mayors has weakened old Democratic power bases. When Chicago helped to tip Illinois to Mr. Kennedy in 1960, the city represented more than a third of the state's vote; by 1984 it was less than a quarter.    But while Democrats have been weakened by the decline of key constituencies since 1960, the surge of GOP support seen in 1984 is fragile as well. University of Arizona political scientist Warren Miller estimates that the shift to the GOP came almost entirely from voters identified as having a low interest and knowledge of politics and motivated more by admiration for Mr. Reagan than any permanent allegiance to a party.    This uncertain commitment contrasts with the much more trusting view toward government seen in the University of Michigan's national election study figures for 1960. If Mr. Kennedy's election symbolized a new generation, it was a generation that emerged from a decade of rising incomes and the belief that public officials cared what it thought. Today, by contrast, the competitiveness of an international economy has increased anxiety, and 52% of those questioned in Michigan's national election survey in 1986 agreed with the statement &quot;I don't think public officials care much what people like me think.&quot; In 1960, only 25% of those surveyed agreed with that statement.    &quot;The notion that we're falling behind has intensified,&quot; says public opinion analyst Daniel Yankelovich. With it has come a sense of less &quot;control,&quot; made worse, he says, by the collapse of whatever bulwark against doubts that the bullish stock market offered.    In Mr. Kennedy's time, says Mr. Yankelovich, there was still a belief that the &quot;rising tide lifts all boats.&quot; Now, he says, &quot;the mood is much more Darwinistic. There are still winners, but you can be a loser if you don't scramble.&quot;    ---                        1960s vs. 1980s                                         1960s      1980s    General population    White voting rate over blacks        +21  %     +10  %    Male voting rate comapred with     women's                             + 7  %     - 1.6%    Married women in work force           30.5%      54.2%    Households headed by women             8.3%      11.6%    Population over age 25 with     college education                     7.7%      19.1%    Voters under 45    Voting-age population under 45        49  %      58  %    Male voting rate compared with     women 25-44 years old                +3  %      -7.7%    College vs. high-school grads     voting rates for men 25-44     years old                           +13  %     +57  %   NOTE: Numbers based on Census Bureau population and votersurveys</TEXT></DOC>
