He was again using strong language last week at a closedmeeting of republic-level Communist Party chieftains.According to Pravda, Mr. Gorbachev warned that &quot;destabilizingefforts&quot; were being made by &quot;destructive&quot; forces around thecountry. &quot;Civil war&quot; will ensue if he is ousted from theSoviet presidency, he predicted.</LP><TEXT>   He had called together his party barons to impress uponthem the importance of next Sunday's referendum on preservingthe Soviet &quot;union.&quot; It seems to have belatedly occurred tohim how embarrassing a failure to rally an impressive numberof yes votes will be. When he dreamed up the referendum, heassumed most citizens would flinch at the thought ofdissolution. Now he can no longer be sure. Six republics areboycotting the referendum and three, on their own, havemodified the complex wording Mr. Gorbachev had devised toensure a maximum chance of approval and, as a fallback, atleast keep the vote subject to his own interpretation.   Party stalwarts at all levels hardly need to be told thattheir own necks are at stake. What started out as areferendum on union has become a referendum on the partyitself, which can't afford much more rejection. The party haslost most of its moral authority in Georgia, Azerbaijan,Armenia and the Baltic States. It is losing ground steadilyin Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia and the Central Asianrepublics. Boris Yeltsin wins more popular support in theRussian Federation with each new attack on Mr. Gorbachev.   A just-released poll of 1,050 Russians aged 18 to 25,commissioned by Reader's Digest, gives Mr. Gorbachev only a6% approval rating, compared with 39% for Mr. Yeltsin. Asubstantial majority felt that communism has been bad for theSoviet Union and an overwhelming majority had a positive viewof the U.S. There were heavy votes in favor of privateownership of land and the right of republics to secede.   No wonder then that the general secretary has becomestrident about anti-party &quot;radicals,&quot; considering that he hasunwittingly given the Soviet peoples their first chance tovote on his and the party's stewardship. The auguries clearlyare not good. Citizens of all three Baltic States have votedoverwhelmingly for secession. Many ethnic Russians paidlittle heed to communist warnings that they would becomesecond-class citizens in an independent Lativa, Estonia orLithuania.   Elsewhere, Georgia is almost in a state of civil waralready as armed groups clash with special security forcestrying to restore Moscow's control. In Russia, miners'strikes have been spreading, threatening further damage to atottering economy. Four huge anti-Communist streetdemonstrations, including one yesterday, have rocked Moscowsince Jan. 1. Popular support for the party in Leningrad ispractically nil.   Communists have a lot to lose. Overthrow of the EastGerman party revealed that communists can be just as greedyas the next guy. Absolute power both facilitates and masksthe greed. The German party had accumulated vast wealth.Soviet communists surely can't have been less successful.Indeed, the Soviet &quot;nomenklatura&quot;, or party elite, isrenowned for its high living. Mr. Yeltsin wrote in hisautobiography that the KGB, with all its other assignments,manages the property assigned to party bigwigs.   The danger of losing everything is a powerful motivator.Party general secretaries combine elaborate perquisites withthe threat of dismissal to ensure allegiance from their toplieutenants. Now, with the entire party threatened withdismissal, its most radical defenders have been rising to thetop. They include the likes of Interior Minister Boris Pugoof Vilnius fame and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov, inventorof currency theft by decree.   As always, the most important weapon at the party'sdisposal is its &quot;shield and sword,&quot; the KGB, which issuperior to the Interior Ministry (MVD) and all otherinstruments of internal security. The forefathers of today'sKGB officers used hamfisted tactics to save the flounderingBolsheviks from an early demise. They carried out Stalin'sbrutal drive for absolute power. Mr. Gorbachev softened theKGB's tactics with &quot;glasnost&quot; and still is adapting them totoday's needs, but its capacity for violence is, if anything,stronger than ever.   The combined forces of the KGB and MVD constitute a verylarge and well-equipped army. If you include KGB troops whoguard Soviet borders, it has some 1.5 million members, and itis being steadily expanded, partly by recruiting regular armyveterans who are being furloughed through force reductions.   According to Jane's Defense Weekly, the MVD's OperationalDesignation forces are being doubled in size to some 72,000.Their role is to move into trouble spots to fightinsurrections. Also being expanded are the infamous OMONanti-riot squads, or &quot;Black Berets,&quot; who performed with suchruthlessness in Vilnius at the request of local CommunistParty cadres. The Kremlin takes some pains to insist thatthese units intervene only to protect local groups facingassaults from &quot;radicals&quot; but of course that is just anotherway of saying that they are called on to protect the party,or its remnants.   There can be little doubt that the KGB itself oftenengineers anti-party violence to provide an excuse for theparty to call out the Black Berets. Such deceptions haveserved the party well for years, sowing confusion among thepeoples of Soviet republics about whom can be trusted andwhom cannot be. It is hard to form political organizationsunder such conditions.   Whether these time-tested methods can work for MikhailGorbachev in 1991 is open to question nonetheless. Butapparently he intends to lead the party's last stand, tryingto conduct his own velvet revolution but using the BlackBerets where called upon to discourage anti-party forces.   He also continues to plead with the West forunderstanding. He told British Prime Minister John Major lastweek that independence is possible for the Baltic States ifthey follow constitutional methods. Mr. Major at leastpretended to be satisfied with that, although he surely knowsthat independence is in fact impossible under therequirements of the Soviet Constitution.   But good will in the West is fleeting, as the widespreadWestern outrage over the Vilnius massacre proved. Mr.Gorbachev seemed to be warning the party, and the West, lastweek that there may be more of the same ahead. He will try topaint his adversaries as the villains and may succeed at thatwith some Westerners. But the big question is whether he cansucceed with the Soviet peoples, and that is far moreproblematical.</TEXT></DOC>
