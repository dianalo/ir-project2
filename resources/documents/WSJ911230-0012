After a recessionary year where a bull market inabsurd litigation was a rare sign of growth, herewith a newindicator: The more brazen the lawsuits, the more chilled theeconomy.   Only litigators will take comfort from this observation,which may contain more than a little cause and effect. Thisis the charitable season, however, and the tradition of thiscolumn calls for a tribute to those who dedicated themselvesover the year to challenging the law as it is to create lawas it should never be.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Swedish Bikini Team Leads to Hostility?                                                                                                          Lori Peterson, a few months out of the University ofMinnesota Law School, dreamed up an argument that mustqualify as trendiest of the year. She filed lawsuits onbehalf of several women at a Stroh's plant in St. Paul thatincluded allegations of clear sexual harassment, but alsoclaims that an ad campaign helped create the &quot;hostileenvironment.&quot;   The lawsuits cite television ads for Stroh's Old Milwaukeebeer. A group of men camping agree that &quot;it doesn't get anybetter than this&quot; until the appropriately dressed &quot;Swedishbikini team&quot; parachutes in to join them. Ms. Peterson saysthese ads send a corporate message that it's fine to harasswomen. The company responds that the lawsuit is a &quot;vehiclefor plaintiffs' counsel to pursue personal, social andpolitical objectives.&quot; Can frivolous cases get better thanthis?                                                                                                          Harvard turns crimson.                                                                                                          Students formed the Harvard Law School Coalition for CivilRights to sue their school, claiming they were damaged by alack of diversity on the faculty. They complained about toofew homosexual, minority and women professors.   There's something odd about accepting admission to aprivate law school and then suing it, but in any case theirlawsuit flunked Civil Procedure 101. Massachusetts SuperiorCourt Judge Patrick Brady gave the students a tutorial inFebruary when he said they had no right to sue. Under theclear language of the state law, only employees, rejectedemployees or would-be employees have standing to sue foremployment discrimination.                                                                                                          National Frivolity Society.                                                                                                          Harvard Law is the logical destination for Justin Dangler,a high-school student in Yorktown, New York. When histeachers decided he didn't qualify for the National HonorSociety, his parents made it a federal case. They sued for $2million. Federal Judge Gerard Goettel said under the narrowrules for dismissing lawsuits he'd have to allow a jury trialeven though this is a &quot;dispute distinctly within the realm oflocal educational authorities.&quot; The jury ruled against theDanglers.   Last month, Judge Goettel sent a message to theoverlitigious by ordering the Danglers to pay the schooldistrict's $60,000 legal bill. &quot;It is simply not in thepublic's interest to have frivolous cases litigated,&quot; JudgeGoettel ruled last month.   &quot;Our federal court system is being brought into ridiculeand our Constitution debased by persons who proclaim themselves to be its strongest supporters: civil rights advocatesand attorneys purportedly working in the public interest,&quot; hesaid. &quot;By attempting to elevate mere personal desires intoconstitutional rights and claiming denial of their civilrights whenever their desires are not realized, these personsare demeaning the essential rights and procedures thatprotect us all.&quot;                                                                                                          Jurisprudence of pasties.                                                                                                          Many cases demean the idea of a common-sense rule of law,but few match the year's most frivolous case, Barnes v. GlenTheatre. This case is remarkable not for the absurdity of thelegal issue so much as for how seriously so many judges tookit.   The question was whether dancers at the Kitty Kat Loungein South Bend, Indiana, had to stop at pasties and G-stringsduring their stripteases. Like almost all states, Indianaprohibits public nudity, a prohibition the strippers saidviolated their First Amendment rights.   The federal courts spared no expense to resolve thematter. The five-year litigation started at the federalDistrict Court for the Northern District of Indiana, thenwent to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, back to thedistrict court, back up to the appeals court, to the fullappeals court and finally to the U.S. Supreme Court, whichruled in June. The appeals judges in Chicago invalidated thelaw by a 7-4 vote that generated six separate writtenopinions, but the law was upheld in the Supreme Court by a5-4 vote that included four separate opinions, none of whichhad the support of a majority of justices.   The more than 50 pages in the Federal Reporter from theappeals court included an opinion by Judge Richard Posner toinvalidate the law learned enough to be published in ajournal of dance criticism. In a single paragraph, hedescribed the satyr plays of ancient Greece, the Radio CityMusic Hall Rockettes, belly dancing and the Richard Straussopera &quot;Salome&quot; and its Dance of the Seven Veils. He alsomentioned bull fighting, Homeric epics, rock and roll andManet's &quot;Dejeuner sur l'Herbe.&quot;   &quot;The true reason I think for wanting to exclude stripteasedancing from the protection of the First Amendment is not anyof the lawyers' classification games that I have beendiscussing, such as expression versus nonexpression, ideasversus emotions, art versus entertainment or speech versusconduct,&quot; Judge Posner wrote. &quot;It is a feeling that theproposition, `The First Amendment forbids the state ofIndiana to require striptease dancers to cover theirnipples,' is ridiculous. It strikes judges as ridiculous inpart because most of us are either middle-aged or elderlymen, in part because we tend to be snooty about popularculture.   &quot;But the element of the ridiculous is not all on oneside,&quot; Judge Posner said, concluding that the pastiesrequirement must go. &quot;What kind of people make a career ofchecking to see whether the covering of a woman's nipples isfully opaque, as the statute requires?&quot;   Judge Daniel Manion, who wanted to uphold the law, notedthat none of the parties in the lawsuit actually cited thetext of the First Amendment, which refers to &quot;freedom ofspeech,&quot; but not expression, much less stripteases. For thatmatter, as Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote, &quot;Almost the entiredomain of Indiana's statute is unrelated to expression,unless we view nude beaches and topless hot dog vendors asspeech.&quot;   Judge Richard Cudahy went to the heart of the matter byasking, what are we doing here? &quot;Despite impressive displaysof scholarly analysis and broad-ranging erudition on allsides, the need to invoke the First Amendment here strikes meas a bit trivializing and, per haps, unworthy,&quot; he said. Hemade clear in the footnotes what he thought about the pathjurisprudence has taken if this is a First Amendment issue:   &quot;It seems to me beyond doubt that a barroom striptease is`expressive,'&quot; he said. &quot;In a real barroom, messages wouldprobably also flow in the opposite direction, in the form ofencouraging comments to the performer from the patrons.(*) .. . It is also clear that the message of the striptease isnot a subject that the Founding Fathers had in mind indrafting the First Amendment.(**)   (*) E.g., `Take it off; take it off]'   (**) No doubt, however, such messages -- sent according tothe style of the day -- were known to the Framers.&quot;TheSupreme Court upheld the pasties requirement, but onlyJustice Antonin Scalia said that a general law against publicnudity is simply a legislative reflection of public moralitythat raises no First Amendment issues. &quot;The purpose ofIndiana's nudity law would be violated,&quot; Justice Scaliawrote, &quot;if 60,000 fully consenting adults crowded into theHoosier Dome to display their genitals to one another, evenif there were not an offended innocent in the crowd.&quot;   Justice David Souter pointed out that the real purpose ofthe law is to prevent secondary effects, including&quot;prostitution, sexual assault and other criminal activity.&quot;If the law is on the books, the police can use it to shutdown establishments that threaten public safety.   The point lost on almost all the judges is how they endedup spending so much effort on such a trivial issue. Theexplanation is that an activist jurisprudence now demandsthat judges substitute their views for the decisions made bythe political branches of government. Judge Easterbrookobjected to this trend. He wrote, &quot;Complex reality mocksrules, yet we must deny ourselves the comfort of requiringthe law to match the universe.&quot; Judicial restraint sometimesmeans leaving well enough alone; let Indiana legislatorsregulate stripteases.   Some judges might find the First Amendment implications ofstripteases more fascinating than, say, creating bright-linetests for the due process required for punitive damages orfinally deciding when the Takings Clause requirescompensation for property losses due to regulations. Yetthese more serious, more legal issues cry out for clearrules.   The liability crisis continues. Foreign investors insiston private arbitration agreements or London courts beforethey agree to U.S. deals. A recession is a reminder that ourlegal system adds costs for anyone who does business here.Strippers know they must wear pasties, but the public waitsfor a sign from the legal establishment that importantquestions are the ones that deserve judicial resolution.</TEXT></DOC>
