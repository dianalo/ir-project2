The city's public transportation system can get you into andaround town, anywhere you want to go. And with better than 100,000visitors arriving every day to join more than seven million NewYorkers, do you really want to look for a place to park onManhattan streets?   Getting into town to start with is easy enough, with three majorairports, two major train terminals, and one major bus terminal,all connected with local buses and taxis and most with the subwaysystem.   LaGuaria and John F. Kennedy International airports, both inQueens, are linked to Manhattan by limousine, taxi, or minibus; JFKadditionally has a bus-subway connection. Newark International,across the Hudson River in New Jersey, has buses and bus-traincombinations to bring passengers into the city.   Both Penn Station (Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street on the WestSide) and Grand Central Terminal (Park Avenue and 42nd Street onthe East Side) bring rail passengers directly into the heart of thecity. Those who come by intercity bus arrive at the Port AuthorityBus Terminal (Eighth Avenue at 42nd Street on the West Side). Fromany of these, you can get to your hotel with a short taxi, bus orsubway ride.   Once in town, you can get around by subway (230 miles of lines),buses (1,745 miles of routes), taxis (12,000 licensed yellow cabs),or on foot to any place in Manhattan or four other boroughs -Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Reach Staten Island bythe bargain-priced (50 cents) Staten Island Ferry. Bus and subwayfares are $1.15, and taxis make a $1.50 initial charge plus 25cents for each additional one-fifth mile.   Subway and bus route maps are available on buses, at subwaytoken booths, and the New York Convention andamp; Visitors BureauInformation Center at 2 Columbus Circle. The bureau also has aninformation phone, (212) 397-8222, staffed from 9 a.m.to 6 p.m. togive you route advice and answer other tourist questions.   Another version of the subway guide, published by John Tauranac,Ltd., presents the system in a set of three maps - one illustratingweekday service, one showing evening and weekend service, and thethird with late-night operations. The format is manageable 13x17inches and folds in eighths for pocketing. It's available inbookstores at $2.50.   Self-guided walking tour booklets also are available at thevisitors bureau. These include guides to Rockefeller Center,historic sights in Lower Manhattan, and all other Lower Manhattansights and attractions.</TEXT></DOC>
