No correlation of the seafloorprofiles and longwall panels was observed. Lack of reference profilesacquired prior to mining has made it impossible to make conclusive evaluations.It is felt valuable subsidence information could be obtained if recommendedprocedures were followed. These include: recording of reference profilesbefore longwall mining; layout of survey lines relative to mine projections;the selection of optimum recording scales for the geophysical data; and,recording geophysical profiles under optimum sea conditions. 9 refs.,24 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
