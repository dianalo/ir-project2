The present study is designed to study thedispersion of particles in a mesoscale eddy field produced by the numericalmodel. Dispersion rates are calculated for flows above three types oftopography, a flat bottom, a random collection of hills and a ridge.The presence of topography is found to significantly affect the flow.The effective diffusion coefficient of the flow near the bottom is reducedby 20% for the random topography and 60% for the ridge from that forthe flat bottom case. Estimates are given of the number of float yearsrequired to obtain a given accuracy for the diffusion coefficient. Atthe surface a modest number of floats (order 5) are required to obtaina 50% accuracy. However at the bottom, to be within a factor of 2 ofthe true value for the flows considered requires respectively 26, 42and 103 float years for the flat, random and ridge cases.</TEXT></DOC>
