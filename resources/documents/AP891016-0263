The Federal Reserve backed up the reassuring wordswith hard cash, injecting $2 billion into the U.S. financial system.   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his first public comments aboutthe market gyrations since Friday's 190-point plunge, said thecentral bank and government agencies were ``watching development infinancial markets rather closely.''   ``We maintained particular surveillance overnight of Asian andEuropean markets and have kept in productive contact with ourcounterparts abroad,'' Greenspan said in a speech to the AmericanBankers Association.   ``Coordination exists at a detailed level here in the UnitedStates among the Federal Reserve, the SEC (Securities and ExchangeCommission), the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) andthe Treasury Department,'' he said.   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York accounced that it waspumping $2 billion into the banking system today. It accomplishedthis by buying government securities from banks. The money providedby the Fed to purchase the securities increased the amount ofreserves that banks have to make loans.   The Fed had sent signals over the weekend that it would supplyas much liquidity as needed to the banking system in an effort tocontain the damage from the Friday the 13th stock market plunge.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which skiddedmore than 49 points in the first 30 minutes of trading thismorning, sported a gain of 43.24 points at 2,612.09 by noon on WallStreet.   Bush was asked about the stock market today at a picture-takingsession in the White House. ``I'm not worried,'' he said.   Addressing a reporter, the president said, ``You ask if I'mworried. No. The Federal Reserve and the SEC (Securities andExchange Commission) and the secretary of the Treasury aremonitoring the situation and that's where it stands right now.''   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush also was keepingclose tabs on the situation, mainly through Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady.   ``The president feels that the economy remains strong ... theeconomic outlook continues to look good,'' Fitzwater said.   He said Bush would be alerted by Brady _ who attended themorning senior staff meeting at the White House to discuss thesituation _ if the government needed to take any specificmarket-calming steps.   ``We wouldn't speculate'' on what steps might be taken, thespokesman said. ``We'll continue to watch it (the markets). It'spretty hard to tell what the market's going to do.''   A senior Fed official, speaking on condition of anonymitySunday, said the central bank was prepared to flood the bankingsystem with money to prevent any further stock decline fromrippling out of control.   ``We will be there with all the liquidity demand that isneeded,'' the official said in a telephone interview. ``If thereare any doubts about liquidity being available, there is no reasonto be concerned.''   The term ``liquidity'' refers to the ready availability of cash.   Developments in overseas marneeded cash to the banking systems in theircountries to stem anyfallout from the U.S. plunge.   The world's central banks also were prepared to intervene ifnecessary by buying dollars to keep the value of the U.S. currencyfrom falling precipitously, the official said.   For the 6,500 bankers gathered for cocktails and conferences,market events are reminiscent of the opening of the group's 1987convention in Dallas when the market crashed 508 points, causingGreenspan to abruptly cancel his speech and jet back to Washington.   Greenspan was widely credited with decisive action thatprevented the 1987 crash from wreaking havoc on the banking systemand perhaps toppling the entire country into a recession.   While the injection by the Fed of massive amounts of cash intothe system cannot by itself push stocks higher, it does serve toreassure nervous bankers that they need not cut off credit tosecurities firms suffering heavy losses.   The brokerage houses, assured of a reliable line of credit, thencan refrain from selling stock simply to replace their dwindlingsupplies of cash. Such waves of forced sales can drive prices downeven further.   C.C. Hope, a board member of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., said the regulatory agency had asked banks to stand ready tohelp if asked by the Fed.   ``The banks are ready to participate. ... The Fed has lined upthe players,'' he said. ``We've just expressed our concern to somepeople and said, `Stand by and be ready to do some assistance ifyou're called upon.'''</TEXT></DOC>
