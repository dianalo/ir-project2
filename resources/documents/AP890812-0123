Police on a highway in south-central Brazil continued tosurround the armored car where the fugitives held the three hostagelate Saturday.   ``We're back to square one,'' said Jairo Pires, a spokesman withthe Sao Paulo State Security Department, said in a telephoneinterview.   The kidnappers, two married couples, had agreed to trade theircaptives for the aircraft and a pilot Saturday, police said.   But after the plane took off from Presidente Prudente Airport,635 miles southwest of Rio, the pilot turned back, saying it wastoo dark to land on the highway, according to police.   The kidnappers began their crime spree on Aug. 3 when theyabducted a boy from his home in Goiania, 852 miles northwest of Rio.   Their motive was not clear, armed robbery and kidnappings forransom have increased in recent months.   Six days after the kidnapping, police found the kidnappers'hideout on the outskirts of Goiania. Police exchanged the boy for$42,000, the armored car, a driver and three local televisionreporters.   After releasing one of the reporters, the kidnappers headed forthe Goiania Airport, where authorities refused to exchange thehostages for an airplane.   Police then chased the armored car 500 miles through threestates. During one stop at a roadside cafe, one kidnapper steppedout of the armored car and held a pistol to a hostage's head.   The chase ended early Friday when the kidnappers stopped on ahighway near Presidente Prudente and demanded a helicopter inexchange for their three hostages.   An Air Force helicopter was summoned from Brasilia to a nearbyairport, but the helicopter pilots refused to fly the couplesunless they surrendered their grenades, machine gun and twoshotguns. Police then contracted a twin-engine plane.   About 100 heavily armed police continued to surround the armoredcar and sharpshooters aimed their rifles at the vehicle's smallwindows.   The three local television reporters who volunteered to take theboy's place at the beginning of the drama were identified asSolange Franco, Monica Calassa and Carla Monteiro. The kidnapperslater released Monteiro.   The standoff was the third in four months in which criminalstook hostages.   In early July, six armed men hijacked a packed passenger bus inthe northeastern state of Bahia after an unsuccessful bank robberyattempt.   After being chased 200 miles across the back woods ofnortheastern Brazil with three hostages, police killed three of thefugitives.   In April, three bank robbers in a remote northeastern townrobbed a bank, took five hostages and fled by plane 1,200 miles tothe Amazon.</TEXT></DOC>
