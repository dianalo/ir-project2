Over 90% of these were larger than 40 MW, and most of theprojects between 40 and 80 MW were in California and New York, whereregulatory restriction caused reduced sizing. Overall, planned capacityappeared in response to recognized need for new generating capacity,and is designed primarily for sale at wholesale to the local electricutility. The cogeneration industry has ceased to have any direct relationshipto cogeneration. In 1987, the cogeneration industry was already almostcompletely dominated by independent power plants that retain cogenerationstatus as a means of avoiding regulation, and thereby reducing costs.For those truly in the cogeneration business, there does not appear tobe much business left. However, the independent wholesale power businessappears strong, and strongest at the large end.</TEXT></DOC>
