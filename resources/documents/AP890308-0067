It is the third year in a row that Jewish Women Against Refusal,whose members have been denied exit visas, have held a hunger strikebeginning on International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday celebratedon March 8.   ``These three hunger strikes have all been during the years ofperestroika. Everyone talks a lot about all the changes due toperestroika, but the situation in emigration is still the same,''said hunger strike organizer Inna Ioffe, who first applied for anexit visa 10 years ago. Perestroika is what President Mikhail S.Gorbachev calls his reform program.   The women are protesting Soviet emigration procedures and callingon Soviet leaders to set up a judicial system to review their cases.   About half of the 46 women participating in the hunger strikehave been refused emigration for reasons of state secrecy, Ioffesaid. Soviet authorities have told them they cannot leave becausethey or their relatives have knowledge of state secrets, she said.   The other half have been denied emigration because their parentsor divorced spouses have failed to certify that they have nofinancial claims on the would-be emigrants, she said.   Women in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Vilnius, Irkutsk andother cities were participating in the hunger strike, Ioffe said.   ``We have no laws to lean on, and we are never given reasonablereasons for the refusals,'' she said.   Ioffe said she has been told she cannot emigrate because her76-year-old mother-in-law, who also wants to emigrate, was exposedto state secrets in her work as a botanist.   More than 20,000 Soviet Jews were allowed permission to emigratein 1988.   Yuri Semenovsky, who has sought in vain for three years to obtaina Soviet exit visa, said at a recent Moscow demonstration of theso-called Jewish refuseniks that 80,000 others have had applicationsrefused.   The majority of the women who participated in the 1988 and 1987hunger strikes have now emigrated, said Ioffe, who also took part inthose hunger strikes.</TEXT></DOC>
