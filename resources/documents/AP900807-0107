But Democrats, who have silenced their attacks to support Bushfor now, contend the latest Middle East crisis and its economicrepercussions will eventually hurt the president at home.   Analysts agree that Bush is at a crucial, defining point of hispresidency, facing a number of major challenges with the potentialfor dramatic and possibly devastating effects on an economy alreadyteetering on recession and, now, the first significant post-ColdWar military crisis.   ``No doubt, he's got his hands full more than he has at anyother time in his presidency,'' said GOP consultant Charles Black,who is helping direct the Republican Party in the absence of ailingChairman Lee Atwater.   ``This is the type of foreign crisis that is very quicklydomesticated in terms of U.S. politics,'' said Stephen Hess of theBrookings Institution. ``Bush is the one who has said, `Watch how Ihandle my first real crisis,' and now he's got one.''   The Iraqi crisis presents daunting risks to the U.S. economy andthe stability of the Middle East, Hess said. But he said Iraq'sSaddam Hussein ``is a villain we love to hate,'' which works inBush's favor.   Key GOP strategists acknowledged that the Iraqi crisis isunusual because of its direct impact on oil prices and therefore onthe U.S. economy _ the primary factor in a president's peacetimepolitical fortunes.   Because of that linkage and the likelihood of higher oil prices_ at least in the short term, regardless of whether Iraq withdrawsfrom Kuwait _ Democratic strategists believe the economy, and Bush,will suffer.   ``If he walks away, he isn't showing any backbone. And if hetakes on Iraq, by definition he impacts on the price of energy,badly, which means a burden on the economy that almost surely willbring recession,'' said Democratic consultant Bob Beckel. ``Apresident's standing with the people depends on their pocketbooksand how they feel about the economy.''   Even before the Iraqi invasion last Thursday, which immediatelyproduced higher gas prices and talk of lines at the pumps, therewere growing signs of consumer unease with the economy.   That unease has been mirrored in financial markets, wary becausemounting data show a virtually idle economy and volatile because ofBush's tax reversal, stalled deficit-reduction negotiations,uncertainty over inflation and the rising cost of the savings andloan bailout.   Add the Iraqi crisis to that mix of domestic challengesconfronting Bush and Democrats see ``the irony of ironies'' _ aRepublican president facing economic problems resembling those ofJimmy Carter; the same problems that Bush and Ronald Reagan oftenlumped together as symptoms of dreaded Carter-era ``malaise.''   ``There are a lot of ducks to shoot out there, and for a changethey're Republican ducks,'' said Beckel.   Black and Bush pollster Bob Teeter argued that Americans willnot blame Bush for economic hardships resulting from his hard lineagainst Iraq but will credit him for bold leadership if Iraq backsdown.   ``The public will understand that higher oil prices are notGeorge Bush's fault,'' said Teeter. ``There's as much opportunityhere as there is risk.''   Said Black: ``The end result of this will be a reinforcing ofthe view that George Bush is the most qualified president we havehad on foreign policy in modern times.'' He also predicted Bushwill ``land on his feet'' in handling the related budgetary issues,without any lasting economic harm.   Democratic hopes for partisan gain seem pinned on a recessionand the belief that Bush's foreign policy credentials won't mattermuch to voters if the economy takes a dive.   ``For now, Democrats and for that matter I think everyone willbe supportive of the president,'' said Democratic pollster HarrisonHickman.   But Hickman said polls show ``people preoccupied with domesticproblems and starting to stick'' some of the blame on Bush. TheIraqi crisis, said Hickman, ``won't negate that, but it buys himsome time because it diverts attention.''</TEXT></DOC>
