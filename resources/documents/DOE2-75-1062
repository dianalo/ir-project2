This paper discusses and illustrateswell-log anomalies caused by TOC as observed on various wireline measurements,including resistivity (or conductivity), acoustic, nuclear (density andneutron), gamma ray, natural gamma ray spectra, and pulsed neutron [sigmaand carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio]. Field examples of these well-log responsesin open and/or closed wellbores are presented from several countries.Several correlations between TOC and individual and/or combinations ofvarious logging responses are also reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
