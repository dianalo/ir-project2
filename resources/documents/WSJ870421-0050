Terra BuildsA Chicago Monument:His Own Art Museum---He Wins Praise for SharingWorks, but Critics DecryMillionaire's 'Egomania'---Hot Dogs for the Ambassador---By Meg CoxStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   &quot;Ronald Reagan has said that I've done more for American art than any other man in the history of the country,&quot; says Daniel J. Terra. &quot;And it's absolutely true.&quot;    Whether or not the president knows that much about art, he can surely spot someone who has done a lot for Ronald Reagan. In 1980, as the Reagan campaign's national finance chairman, Mr. Terra raised $21 million. In return, the president offered the Chicago businessman and collector of American art an array of treats that included the ambassadorship to the Court of St. James's.    Instead, Mr. Terra invented a post: ambassador-at-large for cultural affairs. After six years in that largely ceremonial role, he is best known in Washington for his elegant parties. In his role as collector, he lent Nancy Reagan a landscape for her bedroom. But his more substantial act as an art patron in recent years was the founding of a small museum of American art in the Chicago suburb of Evanston.    Mr. Terra has spent a lot of time making speeches from coast to coast about how the arts should be supported by private people and corporations, not the government. And now his money is backing up his mouth on a grand scale. Today, he is opening a major new institution -- the Terra Museum of American Art -- in Chicago. With enough gallery space to show 350 works, the white marble and glass-fronted museum cost $35 million to build. Barbara Bush, the vice president's wife, will cut the opening-day ribbon. Wealthy Chicagoans and out-of-town dignitaries will celebrate the event at four black-tie extravaganzas.    The timing for the opening is terrific. American art is gaining in recognition and soaring in price at auction. Moreover, Mr. Terra picked an attention-getting location: He bought four buildings on Michigan Avenue, Chicago's toniest shopping street, gutted two of the buildings and transformed them into the museum. With neighbors like Gucci and Saks, the Terra Museum is expected to attract many of the millions who stroll the avenue's famed &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot; each year.    In creating a museum to house his collection, Mr. Terra seems to have considerable company these days. The de Menil family is opening its own museum in Houston in June, while Frederick Weisman, who made a fortune as a Toyota distributor, is searching for a spot near Los Angeles to build a museum for his contemporary collection. Other prominent collectors, among them Armand Hammer, are said to be exploring the possibilities of building their own museums.    &quot;The ego of these collectors is phenomenal,&quot; says Lynn Upchurch, a museum consultant who recently worked for Mr. Weisman. &quot;But these guys have a right to be demanding. They have worked all their lives to do this, and they want to do it right.&quot;    Mr. Terra might serve as the archetype. While friends say he has a good eye and a good heart, not all who know him are his friends. There are those who say he is an egomaniac, building the museum as a monument to himself. Replies Mr. Terra: &quot;You know what I say about this ego-trip stuff? I say: This is going so great, I'm amazed I'm not an egomaniac. I sleep well at night because I know I'm doing my best.&quot;    There is no question that Mr. Terra can be arrogant and impatient, and it sometimes gets him in trouble. Chicago's literati were outraged to hear he was doubling the rent of beloved bookseller Stuart Brent in one of the Michigan Avenue buildings he bought. Mr. Terra said that the additional income would go to the museum. However, in the face of blistering newspaper editorials saying that Mr. Brent -- who is something of a Chicago institution -- would be forced to close, Mr. Terra backed down and extended the bookseller's lease. Says one irate civic leader of Mr. Terra: &quot;I've never seen a man make so many enemies in such a short period of time in a project that should be commendable.&quot;    Mr. Terra describes himself as &quot;short and scrappy.&quot; He is also a man of considerable contradictions. An energetic, raspy-voiced 75-year-old with snow-white hair, he has a net worth above $350 million and prefers to be addressed as &quot;ambassador&quot; -- but insists on driving himself around Chicago in a white Chevy. Friends say his favorite Chicago eatery is a hot-dog stand. Yet he owns four tuxedos and 23 tuxedo shirts for social rounds.    Mr. Terra's father, an Italian stone lithographer, was brought to the U.S. at age 15 by a Philadelphia lithography company. Mr. Terra himself studied chemical engineering and, in 1940, borrowed $2,500 from a friend to start a company making specialty chemicals for printing ink. Today he brags that his Lawter International Inc. has produced 14 millionaires.    Mr. Terra's major hobbies became raising money for the Republican Party and art collecting. In both, he has stubbornly relied on his own instincts. &quot;When he decided to go with Reagan, Reagan was an underdog; the Chicago business establishment was not for Reagan,&quot; says Ronald Melvin, a retired investment banker and former Lawter director. &quot;Dan picked the guy he thought was best.&quot;    For his art collection, he has picked works by the likes of John Singleton Copley, William Merritt Chase, Mary Cassatt, Childe Hassam, John Singer Sargent, Reginald Marsh, Andrew Wyeth, George W. Bellows, Arthur Dove and James McNeill Whistler. The Terra collection is strongest in American impressionism and post-impressionism, stretching from the late 19th to the early 20th century, and weakest in both early and contemporary American art. Mr. Terra particularly loves light-filled landscapes and &quot;pretty&quot; pictures of figures.    Art dealers aren't uniformly impressed by the Terra collection, and some make cracks about Mr. Terra's habit of broadcasting what he buys and how much he paid. But others assert that he deserves praise for sharing his collection. He decided years ago that his focus was American art of historical importance. He attracted much positive attention to his Evanston museum, which he opened in 1980, when he bought Samuel Morse's &quot;Gallery of the Louvre&quot; for $3.25 million in 1982, then a record for American art.    As he shows a guest around the house-sized Evanston facility (which will continue as a satellite of the new museum), Mr. Terra's knowledge and passion are evident. &quot;This painting really makes the saliva come out of museum directors,&quot; he says, stopping in front of an 1892 portrait of Claude Monet by American impressionist Theodore Robinson. &quot;And this is one of a series of five croquet paintings by Winslow Homer: It took me 15 years to talk the owner into selling!&quot;    Former staffers of the Evanston museum say the lack of protocol there was refreshing but also unprofessional. &quot;He ran the museum like his own little toy,&quot; says one former staff professional. &quot;The good side was that after a weekend, you could come back to find three new paintings. In a regular museum, paintings don't just appear out of the trunk of somebody's car.&quot;    Also, unlike most heads of &quot;regular&quot; museums, Mr. Terra would reportedly cancel scheduled museum programs and speakers on a whim. &quot;He would say, 'Forget the symposium, nobody cares. Don't do that show, no one will come,'&quot; says former curator David Sokol, a University of Illinois art-history professor. &quot;He was mercurial. I keep hearing docents, staff and volunteers talk of his arbitrariness. . . . I realize that his vision will last, but day to day, it's hard for any human being to survive under that.&quot;    Mr. Terra asserts, heatedly: &quot;I don't know of anything that's ever been canceled at the last minute. {The Evanston museum} was run absolutely professionally in every sense of the word.&quot;    His entire collection of over 500 works will remain in his estate until he dies, Mr. Terra says, so he doesn't have to consult anyone to buy or sell art. His five other trustees include his lawyer, some fellow businessmen and his son (by his first wife, Adeline, who died) but not his second wife, Judith; none of the five have more than minimal knowledge of art.    Mr. Terra says the board will expand soon; but in the meantime, the lack of outsiders and the concentration of decision-making in the founder could discourage wealthy, art-minded Chicagoans from donating money to the new museum.    &quot;I said to Dan years ago, this isn't your museum anymore. Once you start getting memberships and asking for money, it belongs to the public,&quot; says Mr. Melvin, the retired investment banker and Mr. Terra's first museum director. &quot;He listens to that, but, really, it's his museum and that isn't going to change. It isn't going to get really strong {outside} support until Dan's dead.&quot;    Unlike most large museums, the Terra has no development director to spearhead fund raising. James Collins, Mr. Terra's lawyer, explains: &quot;We figured if we hire all these characters to do fund raising and things, it would take forever. This is his {Mr. Terra's} ego part: He wants to see it now.&quot;    &quot;The art community has looked slightly askance at the whole project. Up to now, it was run like a drawing room,&quot; says Kelvyn Lilly, a Chicago art appraiser. &quot;I know an important CEO who was asked for a substantial amount of money. He said he wouldn't bother because it's Terra's museum, with Terra's name on it, and he's got a lot of money.&quot;    Former staffers say Mr. Terra's autocratic ways haven't altered now that he is opening a much bigger museum and requesting considerable contributions from outsiders. &quot;If he wants to tell the professional staff they can't have an input on the design {of the museum}, he can do that,&quot; says one former staffer. &quot;We all wanted to make changes in the galleries {of the new museum} that would improve them for handling and display of artwork. It was made clear to the staff that it was none of their business.&quot;    Judith Russi Kirshner, a respected curator of contemporary art now on the Terra's staff, says: &quot;There are management problems, but this is a museum with a great location and fabulous possibilities. I remain optimistic.&quot;    Some call Mr. Terra an egomaniac simply because he didn't donate his collection to the Art Institute downtown, which is building a new wing to house its huge collection of American art. Mr. Terra says that discussions were held but that the museum wouldn't give him total autonomy.    Now that the Terra is a reality, its founder talks excitedly about the education programs he has planned, about coming exhibitions borrowed from other museums (he says some shows are planned all the way till 1991) and about phase two of the museum. In 1989, the Terra will expand into another of the four Michigan Avenue buildings Mr. Terra owns, which will allow additional gallery space, a cafe and a 700-seat concert hall. Much of the $22 million building cost is supposed to come from public support.    &quot;We've got great shows coming up, and we expect to get a million people in here this year. There isn't a handful of musuems in this country with traffic that high,&quot; says Mr. Terra, sitting in his slightly disheveled yellow-painted office on the museum's 10th floor. &quot;I think people will support this museum if they like what we do.&quot;    There is a sizable camp of Terra admirers who agree, some grudgingly. &quot;I give tremendous points to Terra for his drive, his energy,&quot; says Lewis Manilow, an investor and art collector who helped found Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. &quot;He wanted to have a great American museum, his museum. Damn it, he's done it and done it first-rate. I don't believe it has to be done with modesty. There will be decades to institutionalize it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
