Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese in 1987 issued adirective calling for special treatment of Nicaraguan politicalasylum cases.   Nine Central Americans were taken Thursday from the INS detentioncenter 20 miles northeast of Brownsville, and sent on buses toHouston, Ms. Kice said. The two Hondurans, three El Salvadorans andfour Guatemalans will be flown to their countries Friday afternoon,she added.   ``We may not be deporting people every day, but this is thesecond group we have deported under our new initiative,'' Ms. Kicesaid.   The INS on Feb. 21 began immediately detaining rejected politicalasylum applicants and marking them for deportation in a one-dayadjudication process. Those detained are held under deportationbonds of up to $4,000 here, and may resubmit their asylum casesbefore an immigration judge.   The first Central Americans deported under the new procedure leftthe country Sunday, Ms. Kice said. On that day, 61 were flown out ofHouston, including 48 El Salvadorans, 10 Guatemalans and threeHondurans, she said, adding the INS spent $16,553 to send them back.   Ms. Kice said the Meese directive does not prohibit the INS fromdeporting Nicaraguans, but ``it says we need to make a careful andthorough review of cases involving Nicaraguans.''   The INS spokeswoman said cases of Nicaraguans not granted asylumwould be referred to the Justice Department in Washington.   Of 458 asylum applications submitted in southern Texas since Feb.21, only 36 _ all Nicaraguans _ had been approved through Wednesday.   Immigration officials held more than 2,700 undocumented aliens,primarily Central Americans, in custody Thursday afternoon inCameron County, the state's southernmost.   Political asylum is granted to those able to show they arefleeing persecution. The INS contends that most Central Americansseeking political asylum are actually applying for economic reasons,and therefore do not qualify.   Some INS critics blame the Meese directive for an influx of morethan 40,000 Nicaraguans and other Central Americans seeking asylumafter crossing the border illegally into southern Texas since lastspring.</TEXT></DOC>
