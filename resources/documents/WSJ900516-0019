The U.S. unit fell almost two yen on worries about recentmixed signals on the U.S. economy and nervousness about thepossibility of lower interest rates, traders said.</LP><TEXT>   Lingering worry over the effect of losses by West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in Sunday'sstate elections caused selling of the mark, especiallyagainst the resurgent yen, they said.   The yen was helped in its rise against the dollar, markand other major currencies by fading concern about theJapanese stock market as Japanese share prices generallyrecover, said Gabriel Grippo, senior foreign exchange traderat Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York.   Traders said that turmoil in the Japanese stock market,now receded, was seen as the most important factor blockingan increase in Japanese interest rates by the Bank of Japan,a step that could strengthen the yen. They noted, however,that with the yen on the rise, such an increase may not benecessary.   The Nikkei stock index finished Tuesday in Tokyo at31,997.04 points, down a slight 45.61 points on lateprofit-taking. The index rose 530.51 points Monday and 531.88points Friday.   Interest-rate concerns are now weakening the dollar, asparticipants try to gauge which way the U.S. economy isheaded, Mr. Grippo and other participants agreed.   The market's interest in today's Consumer Price Indexfigure for April stems from the focus on interest rates, theysaid.   Although most participants believe the Federal Reservewill maintain a neutral stance on interest rates for the timebeing, the CPI is being watched for any sign that pressurefor lower rates might be building. For that reason, it'santicipated that a lower-than-expected CPI number would hurtthe dollar, traders said.   In the general view of traders, the U.S. economy offersthe status quo, while both the West German and Japanesecentral banks promise change. &quot;There's a conviction that theBundesbank will tighten some time soon,&quot; said J. Paul Horne,international economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham inParis. &quot;And we think the Bank of Japan has got to tighten,too.&quot;   That expectation is beginning to clear the air after aperiod of uncertainty over the Japanese currency. In the pastthree weeks, investors in yen-based bonds have fared well.&quot;Most of the flows have been going into the yen,&quot; said GeorgeMagnus, economist with S.G. Warburg Securities in London.&quot;And it's not sure that move is over.&quot;   Sales of the mark against the Japanese unit wereresponsible in large part for a modest rise by the dollaragainst the West German currency, said Erik Lehtis, seniordealer at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in New York.   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 1.6465 marks, up from 1.6425 marks late Monday, and at150.80 yen, down from 152.47 yen late Monday. Sterling wasquoted at $1.6740, down from $1.6825 Monday.   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency wasquoted at 152.05 yen, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 151.30yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6480 marks.   &quot;The (West German) election news inspired a lot ofprofit-taking,&quot; Mr. Lehtis said, noting that the mark'srecent peak around 96 yen had left the West German currencyvulnerable to a correction on technical grounds.   The West German unit ended the New York day around 91.61yen, off from 92.83 yen late in New York Monday.   The mark was also hurt by a denial by West German monetaryauthorities early in the day of a published report that theBundesbank might issue mark-denominated bonds to help financeunification.   The issue of such bonds by the central bank would havebeen positive for the mark because of the added funds theywould have generated for the West German government duringunification, traders said. The denial of plans for an issuedepressed the mark a bit by removing a potential source ofstrength for the currency, they said.   Dealers' long-term mark bullishness remained unshakenhowever, with some crediting a statement by Mr. Kohl late inthe European day favoring an all-German election &quot;at theearliest possible date&quot; with limiting the mark's losses.   Furthermore, most traders remain confident that Germanunification plans will bring about a high-interest-ratestance from the Bundesbank. &quot;A strong Deutsche mark --perhaps heading toward parity against the U.S. dollar in themid-1990s -- will take the inflationary sting out of highEast German growth,&quot; said Shearson Lehman Hutton in a recentreport. &quot;But to ensure the Deutsche mark rises, theBundesbank will need to keep real interest rates very high.&quot;   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $370.90 an ounce, up $2.50. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $370.50 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
