When asked about the statement on the tape that the U.S.government interfered when the hostages were about to be released,Reagan said, ``That is absolutely not true, but let me pointsomething out. Terry Anderson in that terrible confinement at thehands of those barbarians _ any information he has has to have comefrom there; there is no contact with the outside world.''   ``We have been doing everything we can for the release of thehostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to letthem go,'' the president said.   Reagan answered reporters' questions after signing legislationclearing the way for U.S. entry into an international copyrightagreement.   ``There has never been any interference, nor have we ever beennegotiating any more than we would with any other kind of akidnapper on a ransom type of basis,'' he said.   When asked whether he thought the kidnapers were trying toinfluence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, he said,``You'd have to ask them; I can't fathom their minds.''   The president disputed a statement on the tape that VicePresident George Bush was involved in negotiations with terroristsin the Iran-Contra affair and a Middle East TWA hijacking.   ``Nor was I, because we were never doing anything of thatkind,'' he said.   When asked what he thought were the circumstances in which thetape was made, Reagan replied, ``You have to remember, these menare in the closest type of confinement. ...you have to recognizethat no hostage is taking something on himself; they're telling himwhat to do.''   About prospects for the release of Anderson and other Americansheld in Lebanon, the president said, ``I'm not going to give uphope for any of our hostages that are held. That's just toounthinkable.''   But, he said, ``the one thing we cannot do is negotiate with thekidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encouragesmore kidnapping and more hsotage-taking.''   Earlier, Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, saidrelease of the videotape was ``a cynical attempt to use thehostages to influence public opinion, and the only real answer isfor them to release the hostages immediately.''   ``It's not clear what they are trying to achieve, but it'sobviously meant to influence the election'' eight days away, hesaid.   In the tape released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslemkidnappers, Anderson said:   ``I have been very close to being released several times overthe past three years, but each time it seems that the U.S.government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I don'tunderstand this.''   Fitzwater said that statement was ``simply not true.''   Anderson also urged the administration to negotiate his releaseand appealed to the new U.S. president to end the plight of thehostages. The Reagan administration has said it won't negotiatewith terrorists.   Anderson said he was ``not asking Reagan to deal withterrorists, although Mr. (George) Bush did so in the Iran-Contraaffair and TWA hijacking.'' He did not elaborate.   Fitzwater said that statement was ``totally incorrect, wrong.''He declined to elaborate, saying he assumed the vice presidentwould speak for himself.   Fitzwater said the tape ``has some political statements in itthat are cynical certainly and most unfortunate for the hostagefamilies and for all of us who care about their plight.''   Asked whether he regarded Anderson, the chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, as cynical, Fitzwater said,``I think the hostage-takers are, the kidnapers; I don't thinkTerry had much choice.''   Fitzwater said the statements in the tape ``are outrageous; theyare cynical; they are an affront to the families of the hostagesand to the American people.''</TEXT></DOC>
