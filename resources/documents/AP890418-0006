Gen. Prosper Avril, after he fired four ranking officers linkedto drug running illustrates the depth of army involvement in theillegal trade.   Washington says this impoverished Caribbean nation has become amajor transit point in the past three years for drugs _ mainlyColombian cocaine _ on the way to the United States.   Although cocaine seizures in Haiti in 1988 doubled from theprevious year to nearly 1{ tons, according to a State Department,``corruption is a problem and the judicial system is weak. Haiti'slong coastline and mountainous interior also facilitate smuggling.''   Avril has dismissed or retired more than 140 officers, manysuspected of drug trafficking, since soldiers put him in power inSeptember after ovrthrowing Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.   ``Since Avril came to office Haitian cooperation has increasedtremendously,'' a U.S. diplomat said. ``But the biggest problemremains the corruption of the army, the willingness of certainofficers to transship drugs from incoming boats to outgoingplanes'' at isolated ports and airstrips.   U.S. officials have made a crackdown on narcotics traffic acondition for restoring $70 million in aid suspended after theNovember 1987 election was canceled when thugs killed 34 voters.   It is common in Haiti for a captain or major whose pay is $900 amonth to drive a Mercedes and live in a wealthy suburb.   ``The success of drug-running here is due to low army salaries,cheap raw material and huge profits,'' a Western European diplomatsaid. ``One thousand dollars worth of cocaine can arrive here fromSouth America and sell in the U.S. for $100,000.''   Contraband and other rackets also are widespread among the 7,000men of Haiti's army. A diplomat said: ``To crack down on drugs andcontraband in the Haitian army would be like a snake devouring itsown tail. Avril has no choice, but the Americans are making him gotoo fast.''   Avril narrowly escaped a coup April 2 led by four army officers.Loyal soldiers rescued him at the airport, where he had been takenin handcuffs to be deported.   A government statement blamed the plot on opponents of his``vast campaign against drug trafficking, contraband andcorruption.''   Last week, two army units rebelled: the 750 men of theDessalines Barracks adjacent to the presidential palace and theelite 400-member Leopards Batallion. Avril's 1,100-man PresidentialGuard smashed the uprising in a two-day assault on the DessalinesBarracks.   Rebels in the Dessalines, a notoriously repressive unit,expressed anger at what they considered Avril's arbitrarydismissals of the four officers.   Col. Jean-Claude Paul, former Dessalines commander, was indictedon drug charges early last year in Miami and died in November.Poisoned soup was said to have killed him.   A foreign military expert said Paul was popular with his menbecause he ``spread drug money around. He was like theirgodfather.''   Avril dismissed the four officers the day after a visit to Haitiby Richard Melton, a deputy assistant secretary of state. A U.S.Embassy official denied Melton brought a list of people to befired, but said he ``told Avril the U.S. is interested in hisefforts against drug traffickers.''   Diplomats said the four coup leaders, who were not the officersfired, acted from personal ambition and because they felt thedismissals presaged another purge.   ``Avril is walking a very thin line,'' one said. ``The drugrunners have big money and everything to lose in a democraticsystem. One wonders if they will not always block the democraticprocess.''   Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs inWashington, said Avril should dismiss hundreds of junior fficersand soldiers involved in drug transshipment in rural areas.   ``He has hardly cleaned out the stable,'' Birns said. ``He hasjust gotten rid of a few shovel-loads of manure.''</TEXT></DOC>
