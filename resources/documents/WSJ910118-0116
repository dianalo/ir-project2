Does the world look significantly different today thanit did 24 hours ago?   A. Of course. The extraordinary decline in oil prices,assuming they stay down, would clearly have a major effect onconsumer real purchasing power. And obviously, even thoughthe order of magnitude is not very large, a sharp decline inlong-term interest rates is clearly a factor which should, atleast in part, be of help to home-building, which surelyneeds it.                                                                                                          Q. Will this shorten the recession? Will it make it lessdeep?   A. All of the above. We are looking at lower oil prices,which were positive; lower interest rates, which arepositive; and perhaps most important, the potential removalof a significant degree of uncertainty which overhangs theworld economies.   It is important to emphasize that we are still in anunstable environment. As Defense Secretary Cheney suggestedearlier today, the conflict is not over.                                                                                                          Q. Have we seen the worst of the recession?   A. It's hard to say. First, the initial response of theeconomy to the dramatic decline in consumer confidence thatoccurred as a consequence of the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraq ofKuwait has worked its way through the economy through lowersales of passenger cars and light trucks. It has created asignificant impact on fourth-quarter GNP, but the probabilityof further declines in the motor vehicle area is sharplyreduced. In the fourth quarter, we estimate that grossnational product was reduced by 2% or more at an annual rateas a consequence of the passenger car decline, which in turnis largely a function of the drop in consumer confidence. Ifmotor vehicle assemblies currently scheduled are actuallyimplemented, the effect on the GNP in the first quarter wouldactually be a small plus.   What we do not know . . . is whether the erosion which hasoccurred as a consequence of this process has undercut otherareas of the economy which heretofore have been holding upand which could conceivably introduce . . . an accelerationof a recession.   The assumption that the economy is going to bottom outsometime in the spring or early summer is consistent withwhat has occurred over the last several months. The onlything we can say with a reasonable degree of assurance isthat at the moment the recession is not accelerating its paceof decline.                                                                                                          Q. Is it possible that the economy could be growing againby March or April?   A. It is possible. But with the momentum of the decline todate, the likelihood is that the pickup is later.                                                                                                          Q. Given the big potential stimulus from lower oil pricesand lower long-term interest rates, does that mean that thereis no longer any need for the Federal Reserve to ease creditin order to turn the economy around?   A. The Federal Reserve policy is and should continue to befocused upon a number of things, not the least of which is anappropriate rate of growth of credit and monetary aggregates.                                                                                                          Q. The rate of growth of the monetary aggregates has beendismal for some time now.   A. We agree with that, and the aggregates are moving at apace slower than past relations would have suggested andclearly below the path that we would have considereddesirable.   Nonetheless, interest rate moves by the Federal Reserve inrecent weeks have not as yet embodied themselves into thegrowth rate of the money supply. We would expect, though withnot full assurance, that a more appropriate growth rate willsoon ensue.                                                                                                          Q. What evidence do you see that the credit crunch iseasing?   A. The major element underscoring the credit crunch is thedesire on the part of commercial banks to enhance theircapital position. Individual banks are very concerned aboutthe status of their capital and have increasingly pulled backin lending in a number of instances. Ultimately, this processmust lead to a loss of creditworthy customers.   We are finally beginning to see some banks who are bettercapitalized beginning to pick up market share from those whoare less well-capitalized. It is this process which willinduce a number of banks . . . to relend to theircreditworthy customers.   This trend, if it is indeed a trend, is showing up only inthe data of very recent weeks. It is possible that the trendis being distorted by year-end aberrations. Nonetheless, itis the first sign that the credit crunch may be easing.                                                                                                          Q. The Fed has brought down the interest rates that bankspay by 1.5 percentage points, but banks have only reducedtheir prime lending rates by about half a percentage point.Did you intend to boost bank profits rather than cut consumerinterest rates?   A. No. Basically, what we were endeavoring to do was toreduce interest rates and encourage additional borrowing. Inthe context of the credit crunch, it was inevitable that partof the decline in the cost of funds which occurred . . .would end up temporarily as increased margins in commercialbanks.   We expect that to be temporary and that eventually costsavings will flow through to customers.                                                                                                          Q. Historically, bank failures tend to happen as therecession is ending or even as the recovery is beginning.Does that mean we've got big banking problems ahead of us?   A. I should think not. The commercial banking industry isunder stress, but I believe as we look into the intermediatefuture that stress will gradually alleviate.                                                                                                          Q. With the benefit of hindsight, did the Fed wait toolong to start easing credit?   A. I don't think so. Federal Reserve policy basicallyresponds to events as they unfold. I find it very difficultto believe that the pattern that has emerged in recent weeksand that is likely to emerge in the weeks ahead would havebeen significantly altered had we moved somewhat earlier or,for that matter, perhaps even somewhat later.   We have been easing rates since the summer of 1989 whenthe federal funds {interest} rate was close to 10%. {The rateis now about 6.75%}. I look back at the last year and a halfand find few changes of significance that we would like torevisit so far as monetary policy is concerned.
