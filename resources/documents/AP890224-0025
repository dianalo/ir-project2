Bryson wrote in a brief filed Thursday with the highcourt.   ``There is no reason to believe that American legislatures, ifbasic decision-making responsibility were returned to them, wouldnot similarly arrive at humane solutions,'' he said.   The brief, supporting the state of Missouri's position in a casebefore the court known as Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,said the case ``represents'' a proper occasion to reconsider Roe vs.Wade.   But the brief also acknowledged that the Supreme Court could ruleon the Missouri case without touching the 1973 decision thatlegalized abortion.   Bryson wrote that the Roe vs. Wade rests on the premise that``there is a fundamental right to an abortion'' and that states ``donot have a compelling interest in protecting prenatal human lifethroughout pregnancy.''   ``Neither premise, however, is supportable,'' the brief said.   Abortion rights and civil liberties groups condemned thedepartment's action, while it was lauded by pro-life advocates.   ``We're also appalled at the strength of the language, sayingwomen do not have a constitutional right to make their own personaldecisions about reproduction,'' said Tamar Abrams, a spokeswoman forthe National Abortion Rights Action League.   Colleen O'Connor of the American Civil Liberties Union contendedthat there is a constitutional right to an abortion.   ``What Roe vs. Wade clarified was that the decision is a matterof privacy and that right is protect in the Constitution'' throughthe 4th Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search andseizure, O'Connor said.   On the other hand, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for theNational Right to Life Committee, said in a statement that ``weapplaud this intervention by the Bush Administration in defense ofunborn children.''   The Missouri case went to the Supreme Court after the 8th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals on July 13 rejected key portions of theMissouri law.   About 20 briefs were filed in support of the Missouri lawThursday, the deadline for such briefs on that side of the issue.Advocates of the right to an abortion have another 30 days to filebriefs.   The court's decision is expected by July.   In the Missouri case, the appellate court struck down these fiveprovisions of the law:   _A ban on using public hospitals or other government-runfacilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing orassisting an abortion.   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''women to have abortions.   _A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed tobe older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity todetermine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins atconception.''   The appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bansthe use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion.But it said use of a public facility or the services of a publicemployee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by apatient.</TEXT></DOC>
