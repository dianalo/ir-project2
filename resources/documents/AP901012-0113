And it's very cheap.   ``Wouldn't we be ashamed of ourselves if the answer was therefor the taking and we were too shy to look?''   The Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which advocates spaceexploration, financed the supercomputer-controlled radio receiverand signal analyzer with $150,000 raised from its 125,000 membersin more than 100 nations.   The 8.4-million-channel receiver, about the size of two largerefrigerators, is called Megachannel Extraterrestrial Assay II, orMETA II. It is located at Argentina's Institute of Radioastronomy,30 miles southeast of Buenos Aires.   It is identical to META I at Harvard University's Oak RidgeObservatory in Massachusetts. Since 1985, that receiver haslistened to Northern Hemisphere skies for signals from aliens.   Steven Spielberg, who directed the films ``E.T., theExtra-Terrestrial'' and ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,''donated $100,000 for META I.   The META project is the world's most powerful operating searchfor alien radio signals, although nothing has been heard so far.   About 100 people watched as the institute's director, RaulColomb, pointed one of the institute's 98-foot-wide radiotelescopedish antennas toward the Southern Cross, a major SouthernHemisphere constellation, as the receiver was switched on Fridaymorning.   The new receiver is capable of listening to the heart of ourMilky Way galaxy.   If either receiver ever detects radio signals intentionally sentby aliens, it means ``that it's not inevitable civilizations intheir technological adolescence destroy themselves,'' Sagan said.   The United States celebrated Columbus Day on Monday, but Fridaywas the anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in NorthAmerica from Spain on Oct. 12, 1492.   Sagan, who was host of the popular public television series``Cosmos,'' said discovery of extraterrestrials ``would be stillmore powerful and significant and historical. It would be a turningpoint in the history of civilization. Every field of human endeavorwill gain something.   ``The development of technical civilization is likely to happenon countless other worlds,'' Sagan said. Our galaxy alone contains400 billion stars, evidence suggests many have planets, and studiesshow carbon - the basis of life - is abundant in space, he said.   More than 50 limited searches for extraterrestrial intelligencehave been conducted since the 1960s. Almost all previous effortslistened for radio signals above Earth's Northern Hemisphere, withonly brief searches of southern skies.   The META receivers, designed by Harvard's Paul Horowitz, listento radio frequencies around what scientists call the ``waterhole.'' They are frequencies emitted naturally by the breakdownproducts of water: hydrogen, the most abundant element in theuniverse, and hydroxyl, made of one oxygen and one hydrogen atom.Water has one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.   Astronomers believe that like animals gathering to drink,intelligent aliens would pick the ``water hole'' as a way tocontact other civilizations.</TEXT></DOC>
