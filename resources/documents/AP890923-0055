Examination of the DC-10's flight data and voice recorder ``showthat the flight proceeded in a normal manner until a totalinterruption, indicating an in-flight explosion,'' said a statementfrom the Transport Ministry.   The announcement signals the start of an intensive search for theindividual or group responsible for the bombing Tuesday of UTAFlight 772 en route from Brazzaville, Congo to Paris.   Police are examining the plane's passenger list for suspects,concentrating on nine people who got off in the Chad capital,N'Djamena, the plane's last stop before it exploded over the desertin eastern Niger.   Investigators now will attempt to determine the precise nature ofthe explosive, where it was located on the aircraft and, mostimportantly, how it got on board.   The pro-Iranian, Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad, based inLebanon, claimed responsiblity for the crash in telephone calls inLondon and Paris. Officials said they could not authenticate theclaim.   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, quoting anunidentifed source at the presidential Elysee Palace, said Fridaythat authorities would focus their manhunt among the ``Shiitenetwork'' in Africa.   Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut weekly, quoted Islamic militants loyal toIran earlier this week as charging France with reneging on a 1988deal that resulted in the release of three French hostages held inLebanon. The newspaper said the militants were planning attacks onFrench interests in Africa.   France continues to deny making any deal for the hostages, beyondagreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.   Nevertheless, recurring reports in the French press detail a dealin which France secured release of the hostages by agreeing to freeAnis Naccache, a pro-Iranian Lebanese terrorist serving a lifesentence for attempting to murder former Iranian Prime MinisterShahpour Bakhtiar in France in 1980.   The French news magazine L'Express reported Friday that Frenchagents were trying to dismantle Islamic terrorist cells based inFrance's former West African colonies.   French officials denied portions of the L'Express article thatindicated officials in Paris had prior knowledge of a possibleterrorist attack.   French soldiers and military doctors working at the wreckage sitewere to begin airlifting the bodies of victims to Agadez, a villagein central Niger, and then on to the capital Niamey foridentification, French military sources in Chad said. Rugged desertconditions and temperatures of up to 113 have hampered rescue work.</TEXT></DOC>
