That may be goodfor his friends who clip coupons _ but the hard-working taxpayersof this country cannot afford to be clipped again by another roundof ``voodoo economics.''   I wonder who coined that phrase?   America needs more shelters for the homeless _ not more taxshelters for the privileged.   America needs more affordable housing for the middle class, notmore tax breaks for the upper class.   America needs to bring the disabled into the mainstream and notrelegate whole groups of our people to the backwaters of oureconomy.   The next administration must do more than provide comfort forthe comfortable. And the next president must offer more than a paleimitation of a Reaganism whose time has faded.   A new century is dawning; the old order is changing. We mustlook beyond the next election to the horizon of the nextgeneration. And there is no one better matched to the challengethan Mike Dukakis. He saw the future coming in Massachusetts. Heled the transition from a faltering 1950s economy to a moderneconomy at the cutting edge of change. Mike Dukakis is the man whodid it for Massachusetts _ and Mike Dukakis is the man who is goingto do it for the United States of America.   George Bush may want to lower the capital gains tax. But MikeDukakis will repeal the corruption tax we are all paying _ in theform of defense cost over-runs _ and a Pentagon bribery scandalthat has bloated the budget by billions of dollars. So let's notraise taxes on average-income families; let's lower the boom onhigh level corruption.   The years ahead can be a bad time _ or the best of times. Theproblem today is not America's people, but America's leadership.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
