Thecouncil does not need voter approval to tax utilities.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MORGAN HILL UTILITY TAX DEAL STRUCKSURCHARGE IMPOSED NOW, BUT IT'S ON JUNE BALLOT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The utility tax was one of three revenue-generating measures the citycouncil approved Wednesday to help erase a projected $31 million general funddeficit for the year starting July 1.;    If voters turn down the utility taxon June 4, the city says it will have to drastically reduce police protectionand parks and recreation services, which had been scheduled to shut downaltogether May 31. But the two-year life of the utility tax will allow thecity to make an &quot;orderly retreat,&quot; according to Councilman Ray Bunt, whoproposed the compromise.;    The compromise did not sit well with members of acommunity group, who wanted the council to let voters say whether the utilitytax should be imposed in the first place. Sam Edge, a member of CitizensAgainst Unfair Government Higher Taxes, told council members after the meetingthat his group plans to recall them.;    That group forced a vote in 1987 thatrepealed a 5 percent utility tax approved four years earlier.;    Councilmembers heard 39 speakers Wednesday before approving the three revenuemeasures. The great majority of the speakers -- including firefighters, policeofficers and emergency dispatchers who warned of slower response tolife-threatening calls if services are reduced -- urged the council to quicklyapprove tax measures.;    The council increased the tax on hotel and motelbeds from 9 to 10 percent and formed an assessment district to pay for fireprotection. Voter approval of the fire protection district will be requiredonly if property owners who would provide 5 percent of projected revenueprotest.;    It has not been determined how much money the fire protectionassessment district would raise, according to City Manager Jan C. Perkins. Themoney would be used to operate a third fire station.;    The utility taxcompromise was approved 3-2, with Mayor John Sorci and Fred Bassettdissenting. Bassett said voters should be allowed to &quot;buy in on thedecision.&quot;;    Earlier, Bassett was the only one to support his motion to askvoters to approve an assessment district for police protection. A two-thirdsmargin at the polls would be required. Bassett said after the meeting hewanted to &quot;make people responsible for their own lives&quot; by taking a stand onthe issue.;    Five percent of the utility tax will go for police services,the remainder for parks and recreation. Perkins said the amount earmarked forpolice will provide minimum services, resulting in some layoffs. The 1 1/2percent of the utility tax earmarked for parks and recreation will maintaincurrent levels of service.;    Early in the council discussion, Bunt andLaurie Barke unsuccessfully urged their colleagues to approve the utility taxwithout asking the opinion of residents.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DALE RODEBAUGH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  522  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 22, 199100053070,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
