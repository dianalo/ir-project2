The diurnal variationin the probability of disturbance consistently shows minima around sunriseand sunset. Details such as a brief postsunset enhancement in winterare revealed by the fine time resolution of the data. Disturbance probabilitieswere lowest in autumn and spring (8 and 9 percent), while that for winter(33 percent) exceeded the summer level (20 percent). Spread F constituted32 percent of the events, and disturbances producing sharply definedionogram signatures 77 percent, with some overlapping of types. The majorityof disturbances were not correlated with geomagnetic phenomena. Disturbancesat the two stations were essentially independent (spatial correlationof 0.15). Spread F events were of longer duration (25 min) than sharpdisturbances (20 min). 24 references.</TEXT></DOC>
