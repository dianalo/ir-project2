(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Robert L. ScheierandM;Microsoft Corp. delivered the latest nudge in an industrywide shift away fromfree support last week when it unveiled a $2-per-minute 900 number for usersof its BASIC programming language.andM;The move followed the company's announcement earlier this fall that usersseeking help with DOS or OS/2 should call a 900 line or the PC makers thatlicensed those operating systems from Microsoft and then shipped them to thebuyer with the PC.andM;The changes rankled customers, who are used to getting free help to DOSquestions on the phone.andP;  And they spurred rumors that the Redmond, Wash.,andO;software giant might end all its free product support or drop its low-costCompuServe forums, on which many users find help.andM;Company executives deny such plans.andP;  But they say Microsoft will begin paidsupport in cases in which they believe customers need better support and arewilling to pay for it.andM;Microsoft is only one of many software vendors, squeezed by a rising tide ofcomplex questions from users, who are steering customers away from freesupport to 900 lines or on-line help that carries a price tag.andM;The transition angers users such as Greg Tippitt, a senior systems programmerwith insurance firm Munich American Reassurance Co. in Atlanta, who rememberscalling Microsoft directly for help &quot;in the early days, before they got toosuccessful.&quot;andM;He recently called asking for a list of known bugs in OS/2, only to be toldhe had to subscribe to Microsoft's $795-per-year OnLine electronicinformation service to get it.andM;Microsoft, which will spend about $45 million on customer support this year,is a good example of a software company trying to figure out how to providesuch support while limiting its own costs.andM;Microsoft's position seems to be that it will pay for the support if thequestion is routine and the user can wait for the answer.andP;  The user pays ifthe question is more complicated or the user needs the answer more quickly.andM;Last week's announcement is a case in point.andP;  Microsoft will still offer freetelephone support for BASIC, but only from 8 a.m.andP;  to 5 p.m., Pacific time.andO;Additional help for BASIC is available on the $2-per-minute 900 number, theOnCall service, from 6 a.m.andP;  to 6 p.m.andP;  With OnCall, technical assistance isalso available for more complex questions.andM;For applications and languages, &quot;We will always supply free support,&quot; saidJoachim Kempin, vice president of product support.andM;If Microsoft ever instituted a 900 line for applications, said Jim Peterson,director of desktop support at Microsoft's product-support services division,it would supplement rather than replace free support.andP;  &quot;The kinds of thingswe've thought about might be a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week service,&quot; insteadof the Monday-to-Friday phone support offered now, he said.andM;With Microsoft's CompuServe forum for Windows developers, Microsoft employeescan log on and offer to help the developers, but &quot;it's not part of theirjobs,&quot; said Greg Goff, unit manager for marketing and planning at Microsoft'ssystems-support business unit.andM;For that reason, Microsoft steers developers toward the OnLine service, andcorporate information centers toward OnLine Plus, an expanded version thatcosts $9,500 per year.andM;With OnLine and OnLine Plus, the customer is guaranteed an answer from aMicrosoft employee, whereas a user of the CompuServe forum could potentiallyreceive an answer from another user.andM;Some users have suggested that Microsoft might reduce its support for thelow-cost CompuServe forums to convince more users to buy the more expensiveOnLine or OnLine Plus.andP;  However, several Microsoft executives insisted thetwo aren't competitive, because OnLine and OnLine Plus are aimed at corporateusers and developers who will pay for better service, and the CompuServeforums are not.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
