The announcement by the American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp.,International Business Machines and the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology on Tuesday said the consortium's goal is developapplications for the new technology.   Superconductors are ceramic materials cooled to beyond minus 200degrees Fahrenheit, at which point they can let electricity passthrough them without resistance.   In theory, superconductors could let energy be stored and sentwithout any loss of strength and more cheaply than is now possible.Potential uses include faster computers and more powerful batteriesand motors.   Both the United States and Japan are researchingsuperconductors, but the U.S. has the edge.   The goal of the consortium is to make sure American firms,rather than those from Japan, have the advantage in commercialapplication of the research.   ``This will be a consortium of open communication among theresearchers involved,'' the three organizations said in a jointstatement. ``The combining of their scientific knowledge and theirknowledge of applications will benefit the nation.''   The new organization will be called the Consortium forSuperconducting Electronics. Researchers will remain at theirpresent locations but will share information.   In January, the White House Science Council said such anorganization was needed if the United States wanted to avoid whatoccurred in laser and videotape technology.   Both were created in the United States but were commerciallyexploited by Japan.   The consortium announced that research efforts will beconcentrated in four areas, including signal distribution,high-temperature materials and technology, advanced devices andintegrated circuits, and junctions.   The consortium will focus on applying superconductor technologyto high-speed microelectronic devices for use in computers,telecommunications and military systems, the New York Timesreported today.   ``It is a model of how universities, government labs andindustry have to cooperate in the future to address a number ofissues,'' MIT Provost John Deutch told the Times.   Ralph E. Gomory, IBM senior vice president for science andtechnology, told the Times that the consortium would seek $4million to $6 million in financing from a Defense Departmentresearch agency, most of which would go to MIT.   Robert C. Dynes, director of chemical physics research at ATandamp;TBell Laboratories, told the Times that consortium organizersthought having big organizations involved would give the groupweight to attract other members.   ``I don't regard this as the big guys banding together andwiping out the little guys as much as giving the little guys anability to get in the same building as us,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
