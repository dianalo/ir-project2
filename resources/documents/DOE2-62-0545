Conservation equations for two-fluid model together with proposedconstitutive relations were solved numerically by the two-phase flowanalyzer MINCS which had been developed at Japan Atomic Energy ResearchInstitute. Calculated results for the Aritomi's test were in good agreementwith the experimental results. The proposed model were applied to theanalysis of Stewart's experiment using water for verification. A betteragreement between calculated and experimental results was also obtainedat relatively low pressure condition. The effects of liquid inlet subcooling,pressure and flow rate on wall heat transfer coefficient were discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
