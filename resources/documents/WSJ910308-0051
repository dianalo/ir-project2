Live cattle for April delivery rose to a new high of 81.82cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange beforeretreating to settle at 81.40 cents a pound, down 0.15 centon the day.</LP><TEXT>   Pork belly and live hog futures prices also rallied,showing what analysts termed surprising strength for thistime of year. The pork belly contract for May rose 1.72 centsto settle at 67.77 cents a pound, and the April live hogcontract rose 1.50 cents to 54.10 cents a pound.   Analysts attributed some of the strength in cattle futuresto large purchases of meat by the U.S. military for troopsstationed in the Middle East. They also said domestic demandfor beef is strong, prompting prices to advance even in theface of larger-than-normal supplies.   Slaughter of cattle nationally was higher both last weekand this week than during the like period a year earlier.Last week, 611,000 head of cattle were slaughtered, comparedwith 592,000 in the comparable 1990 week. So far this week,474,000 head of cattle have been slaughtered, compared with467,000.   And analysts don't seem to expect a major price correctionsoon. &quot;For prices to drop, either demand would have to taperoff or production would have to increase,&quot; said JerryAbbenhaus, livestock analyst for A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc.,St. Louis. &quot;I don't see those things happening. We may evenset some slightly higher price levels in the next few days.&quot;   The price rally in pork futures yesterday appeared to bebased on memories of a strong pre-Easter rally last year,analysts said. Traditionally, consumer demand for porkproducts, especially ham, rises at Easter.   Last year's rally didn't start until late March, butanalysts say traders may be trying to get a jump by takingpositions in pork futures now. In addition, Easter last yearfell on April 15, whereas it will come on March 31 this year;so the entire rally may simply occur earlier.   Underlying the other price-supporting factors is therecent strength shown by commodity and security marketsgenerally. Grain futures have posted big price gains lately,as have stocks and securities, and this strength in othermarkets tends to bolster livestock traders' confidence,analysts said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Oil prices declined in advance of a meeting of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set for Monday.Crude for April delivery slipped 31 cents to settle at $19.42a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders saidthey felt that not enough time had passed since the end ofthe Persian Gulf war for OPEC members to work out aneffective market strategy. In addition, they said, it's stillunclear how long it will take for Iraq and Kuwait to overcomethe effects of the war and economic sanctions and startproducing oil again. Meanwhile, demand is expected to go intoa normal seasonal decline as winter ends, and if OPEC can'twork out an agreement to curb production, prices willdecline, they said. Much of yesterday's action was promptedby technical factors, but strong fundamentals kept gasolineprices from falling too sharply. The April contract forunleaded gasoline ended 0.62 cent a gallon lower at 70.35cents. Gasoline inventories are relatively lean, and demandwill pick up as the summer driving season approaches.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Silver again stole the spotlight fromgold and platinum. The May silver contract traded as high as$4.035 an ounce but fell on profit-taking to end at $4.015,up 10.5 cents. April gold rose $1 an ounce to $368.50. Aprilplatinum rallied to $403.50 an ounce but fell back to end at$400.50, down 60 cents. Silver's move was largely technical,especially after it went above $4, analysts said. Today'sU.S. employment report could determine whether the rallycontinues, said James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc. If thefigures show a continued decline in the manufacturing sector,silver's rally may be halted, he said, because it has beenfueled by expectations that industrial demand for silver willrise as the economy improves. Ian MacDonald, vice president,precious metals, at Credit Suisse, said he has noticedinvestment and jewelry demand for silver picking up but saidit's too early to tell whether this is a temporary bounce inresponse to the low price or the beginning of a longer-termrally. Bernard Savaiko, senior metals economist atPaineWebber, said that if the rally continues, silver willencounter resistance from profit-taking at around $4.05 to$4.08 an ounce. He attributed gold and platinum's lacklusterperformances to investor preoccupation with the surging stockmarket. If the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaks throughthe 3000 level, &quot;the stock market will be tough competitionfor precious metals,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose. The May contract resumed itsrally, rising as high as 9.52 cents a pound before finishingat 9.46 cents, up 0.13 cent. Reports of sugar purchases byMiddle East countries buoyed the market, analysts said.Meanwhile, tightness in Thailand's sugar supplies has sentJapanese buyers looking elsewhere, helping to work down theabundant supplies in other markets, said Sandra Kaul, ananalyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. But while the recentbuying is encouraging, another analyst said, world demand isstill sluggish. Countries such as China and India thattraditionally import sugar produced large crops of their ownthis year, he said, and consumption in the West is stagnant.Middle East countries may buy a little, he said, but luxurygoods such as sugar are a low priority for countries thatneed to spend billions of dollars to rebuild their industriesand economies.</TEXT></DOC>
