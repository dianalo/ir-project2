At a news conference following Warner's annual meeting of shareholders in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday, Steven J. Ross, chairman and chief executive officer, said a hearing is scheduled Sept. 14 in a lawsuit Chris-Craft filed last month alleging that the Lorimar pact violates Chris-Craft's shareholder agreement with Warner. Mr. Ross said: &quot;Our expectations are that we will win.&quot;    Herbert J. Siegel, Chris-Craft's chairman, wasn't present at yesterday's meeting. Warner said at the meeting that only 64% of its shares were voted in the election of directors. It said it hadn't received any proxies from Chris-Craft, which controls about 17% of Warner's voting stock. Two of Chris-Craft's four directors on Warner's board weren't nominated for re-election this year. </TEXT></DOC>
