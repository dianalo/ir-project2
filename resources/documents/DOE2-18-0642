<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0642 </DOCNO><TEXT>The hydrocarbon biosynthesis mechanisms of Botriococcus braunii alga areinvestigated: the hydrocarbons produced are: n-alcadienes and uneventrienes from C25 to C31, and botryococcenes of general formula CnH2n-10(n=30 to 37). The struture and the stereochemistry of these hydrocarbonsare determined and their formation mechanisms (elongation-decarboxylationmechanism type) are precised; the nature of their key-intermediates isidentified (precursor fatty acids, activated derivatives).</TEXT></DOC>
