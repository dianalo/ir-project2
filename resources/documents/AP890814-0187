It is a status, he says, thatmakes Puerto Ricans second-class citizens, with no vote and nocontrol over their destiny.   The United States, he asserts, ``is one of the few colonialpowers left in the world _ that is a smear on the nation's face.''   Commonwealth supporters contend that the status quo is the onlyarrangement that allows Puerto Ricans to retain their culturalidentity while reaping the benefits of U.S. largesse.   The federal government spent $6.5 billion on Puerto Rico lastyear, and an estimated 60 percent of Puerto Rican families receivemoney under the food-stamp program. The economy is furtherunderpinned by tax exemptions granted to U.S. subsidiaries, whichprovide $10 billion in local deposits and an estimated 30,000 directand indirect jobs.   ``The one thing that works politically is the fear that they maylose some of these benefits,'' says A.W. Maldonado, a prominentcommonwealth supporter and newspaper columnist.   The independence party has always maintained that the UnitedStates has no right under international law to occupy Puerto Rico.The party's leader, Ruben Berrios Martinez, has proposed atransition period during which U.S. programs would be phased out toavoid economic disruption.   Berrios contends that Congress won't accept Puerto Rico as astate because to do so would immediately boost the political cloutof Hispanics.   ``Puerto Rico would be a representative of Latin America in theCongress,'' he said in a recent interview with the pro-statehood ElNuevo Dia.   Earlier this century, the independence movement was a powerfulforce, but support waned as the commonwealth took hold. There arestill extremists who advocate the violent overthrow of U.S. control,but they have been less active in recent years.   Some critics of statehood have suggested that it could result ina situation similiar to Northern Ireland, with a militant elementperpetually trying to force separation.   Since 1968, the commonwealth and statehood parties have held thegovernor's mansion with almost equal frequency, and electionsusually result in near-dead heats. It is unclear, however, whethereither party could muster a 50-percent-plus majority in a statusplebiscite.   In the 1967 plebiscite, 60 percent of the people voted tocontinue the commonwealth relationship, 39 percent for statehood and1 percent for independence. That vote was not binding on Congressand the statehood and independence parties did not actively campaign.   A poll published in February by El Nuevo Dia indicated thatcommonwealth status is less popular than it was 20 years ago, butremains the favored choice.   The poll, carried out by the Yankelovich organization before Bushpublicly backed statehood, found 45 percent for commonwealth, 35percent for statehood and 5 percent for independence, with theremainder undecided. The survey of 500 voters had a statisticalmargin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.   To bolster support for the status quo, Hernandez Colon hasproposed what he calls ``enhanced commonwealth'' in which PuertoRico could reject any federal laws deemed unfair to the island.   The governor also has asked that Puerto Rico be given economicjurisdiction over its territorial waters, authority to issue U.S.passports and the right to negotiate international trade agreements.He has acknowledged that Congress is unlikely to grant all theconcessions.   Plans call for congressional passage of a plebiscite bill by theend of 1990, so that the vote can be taken in 1991 before local andnational elections the following year. The plebiscite is tentativelyset for June 4, 1991.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
