Background </ITAG>A. Authority On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulationsimplementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published an amended list of hazardouswastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amendedseveral times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. These wastesare listed as hazardous because they typically and frequently exhibit oneor more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in SubpartC of Part 261 (<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and extraction procedure(EP) toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2)or (a)(3).Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials,industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste that is describedin these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individualfacility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, 40CFR 260.20 and 260.22 provide an exclusion procedure, allowing personsto demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facilityshould not be regulated as a hazardous waste. To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generatedat their facilities do not meet any of the criteria for which the wasteswere listed. See 40 CFR 260.22(a) and the background documents for thelisted wastes. In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including additionalconstituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if thereis a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could causethe waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstratethat the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics(<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and EP toxicity),and must present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whetherthe waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See 40 CFR260.22(a), 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and the background documents for the listedwastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or notthey exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste, generatorsremain obligated to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardousbased on the hazardous waste characteristics. In addition to wastes listed as hazardous in 40 CFR 261.31 and 26l.32,residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastesand mixtures containing hazardous wastes also are eligible for exclusionand remain hazardous wastes until excluded. See 40 CFR 262.3 (c) and (d)(2).The substantive standard for ``delisting'' a treatment residue or a mixtureis the same as previously described for listed wastes. B. Approach Used to Evaluate This Petition In making a delisting determination, the Agency evaluates each petitionedwaste against the listing criteria and factors cited in 40 CFR 261.11 (a)(2)and (a)(3). If the Agency believes that the waste remains hazardous basedon the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA will proposeto deny the petition. If, however, the Agency agrees with the petitionerthat the waste is non-hazardous with respect to the original listing criteria,EPA then will evaluate the waste with respect to other factors or criteria,if there is a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factorscould cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considers whether thewaste is acutely toxic, and considers the toxicity of the constituents,the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their tendency to migrateand to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once releasedfrom the waste, plausible and specific types of management of the petitionedwaste, the quantities of waste generated, and any other additional factorswhich may characterize the petitioned waste. The Agency is proposing touse such information to identify plausible exposure routes for hazardousconstituents present in the waste and to determine the potential impactof the unregulated disposal of CRF's petitioned waste on human health andthe environment. The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoringdata to its evaluation of delisting petitions. In this case, the Agencydetermined that, because the waste is currently stored in above-groundtanks, ground-water monitoring data collected from the petitioner's facilitywould not characterize the effects of the petitioned waste on the underlyingaquifer. Therefore, the Agency did not request ground-water monitoringdata. Finally, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 specificallyrequire the Agency to provide notice and an opportunity for comment beforegranting or denying a final exclusion. Thus, a final decision will notbe made until all public comments (including those at requested hearings,if any) on today's proposal are addressed.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Petition </ITAG>Environmental Protection Agency, Combustion Research Facility, Jefferson,Arkansas <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Petition for Exclusion </ITAG>The EPA Office of Research and Development submitted a petition to exclude,on a one-time basis, scrubber water generated from the incineration ofdioxin-contaminated distillation bottoms at the Combustion Research Facility(CRF), located in Jefferson, Arkansas. The distillation bottoms, referredto as the ``Vertac waste'', originated from the production of 2,4,5-trichlorophenolby the Vertac Chemical Company, located in Jacksonville, Arkansas. CRFincinerated this material as part of a research program to study the feasibilityof incinerating hazardous waste. The petitioned scrubber water is listedas EPA Hazardous Waste No. F020_``Wastes (except wastewater and spent carbonfrom hydrogen chloride purification) from the production or manufacturinguse (as a reactant, chemical intermediate, or component in a formulatingprocess) of tri- or tetrachlorophenol, or of intermediates used to producetheir pesticide derivatives''. The listed constituents for EPA HazardousWaste No. F020 are tetra- and pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins; tetra- andpentachlorodibenzofurans; and tri- and tetrachlorophenols and their chlorophenoxyderivative acids, esters, ethers, amines, and other salts. CRF petitioned to exclude its incineration scrubber water because it doesnot believe that the waste meets the criteria of the listing. CRF furtherbelieves that the waste is not hazardous for any other reason (<T3>i.e., </T3>there are no additional hazardous constituents or factorsthat could cause the waste to be hazardous). Review of this petition includedconsideration of the original listing criteria, as well as the additionalfactors required by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of l984. SeeSection 222 of the Amendments, 42 USC 6921(f), and 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)-(4).Today's proposal to grant this petition for delisting is the result ofthe Agency's evaluation of CRF's petition. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Background </ITAG>CRF originally petitioned the Agency to downgrade the scrubber water under40 CFR 260.20 from ``acutely hazardous'' to ``toxic''. A proposal to grantthis petition was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 3, 1986 (see 51 FR 19859). The basisfor this original proposal was the low levels of dioxin (less than 10 ppt)detected in two of four samples (dioxin was not detected in the other twosamples). Under the proposal, the scrubber water was to remain listed asa toxic hazardous waste because, at that time, no demonstration was madeto show that it did not exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardouswastes or that it did not contain any other toxicants at levels of regulatoryconcern. CRF subsequently conducted additional analyses on representativesamples of the scrubber water because of questions concerning the validityof the original analytical results. Upon examining the original analyticalresults, CRF suspected that dioxin laboratory contamination was presentbecause of an unusual distribution of tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins(TCDDs) isomers; in the laboratory report, all of the TCDD isomers werereported as 2,3,7,8-TCDD rather than the expected mixture of isomers. Seeletter from R.E. Mournighan to Dr. Waterland, April 9, 1987, in the docketto this notice for additional information. Based on these additional analyses,CRF requested that the Agency not finalize the original proposal and insteadconsider CRF's request for a full delisting. The original proposal alsoproposed to downgrade all future scrubber waters from the incinerationof listed dioxin-containing waste generated by CRF, contingent upon certaintesting requirements. This notice serves to withdraw the proposed downgradefor CRF's scrubber waters. CRF intends to petition separately for delistingof these future wastes on a waste-by-waste basis. In support of its delisting petition, CRF submitted (1) a detailed descriptionof its incinerator, including schematic diagrams, an engineering description,and the incinerator operating conditions; (2) a description of the ``Vertacwaste'' that was incinerated; (3) results from total constituent analysesof the scrubber water for the EP toxic metals and nickel; (4) results fromtotal constituent analyses of the scrubber water for 40 CFR Part 261 AppendixVIII organics; and (5) analytical test results on chlorinated dioxin andfuran (CDD/CDF) concentrations in the scrubber water. The original proposal to downgrade CRF's waste contained complete descriptionsof the incinerator and the conditions of the trial burn which generatedthe scrubber water. These descriptions, which are still accurate, werepublished previously (see 51 FR 19859) and therefore are not repeated intoday's notice. The petitioned waste has not undergone further treatmentsince the time of the original proposal. To collect representative samples of liquid wastes like CRF's, petitionersare normally requested to collect a minimum of four representative samplescomprising independent grab samples collected over time or area (<T3>e.g., </T3>grab samples collected every hour and composited by shift).See ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste: Physical/Chemical Methods'',U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Publication SW-846(third edition), November 1986, and ``Petitions to Delist Hazardous Waste_AGuidance Manual'', U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste, (EPA/530-SW-85-003),April 1985. CRF collected a total of twenty six samples drawn from the two storagetanks which hold the entire volume of petitioned scrubber water. Six sampleswere collected and analyzed in August 1986 for use in the trial burn report(two samples for metals analysis, two samples for organics analysis, andtwo samples for chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans(CDD/CDF) analysis). Twenty additional samples were collected over twodays in November 1987 to support the delisting petition (eight samplesfor metals analysis, eight samples for organics analysis, and four samplesfor CDD/CDF analysis). For both sampling events, the tanks were recirculatedfor over eight hours prior to sampling. CRF claims that, due to the mixingand the nature of the petitioned waste, the waste is not variable and analysesfrom samples drawn in this fashion are representative of the scrubber waterconstituent concentrations. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Agency Analysis </ITAG>CRF submitted analytical data which quantified the Appendix VIII constituents,including dioxin, likely to be present in the scrubber water, as well astotal constituent analyses for the EP toxic metals and nickel. CRF usedEPA Publication SW-846 Methods 6010 and 7470 to quantify the total constituentconcentrations of the EP toxic metals and nickel in its waste. CRF usedMethods 601 and 602 (``Methods for Organic Chemical Analysis of Water andWaste by GC and GCHPLC'', Longbottom and Lichtenberg, EPA EMSL/Cincinnati,1982) and SW-846 Method 8270 to quantify the total constituent concentrationof Appendix VIII hazardous constituents in its waste. All dioxin analyseswere conducted according to Method 8290 for high resolution gas chromatography/highresolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) analysis. The maximum constituentconcentrations of the metals, organics, and dioxin are summarized in Tables1, 2, and 3, respectively. Detection limits represent the lowest concentrationsquantifiable by CRF, when using the appropriate EPA analytical methodsto analyze its waste. (Detection limits may vary according to the wasteand waste matrix being analyzed, <T3>i.e., </T3>the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices varies and ``dirty''waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising the detection limits.)Based on information submitted by CRF in its petition, none of the samplesexhibited the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity.See 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.23.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Maximum Total Toxic Metals Concentrations (mg/l) Scrubber Water</T4><H1>Constituents</H1><H1>Concentrations</H1><ITAG

The Agency reviews a petitioner'sestimates and, on occasion, has requested a petitioner to re-evaluate estimatedwaste volume. EPA accepts CRF's estimate of 7,000 gallons (approximately100 cubic yards). <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Agency Evaluation </ITAG>As shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3, the only detected constituents in CRF'swaste are barium, lead, nickel, 1,1-dichloroethane and TCDF. The Agencyevaluated the five detected constituents in CRF's waste in a two-step process.First, the Agency compared the detected levels directly to the health-basedlevels used for delisting purposes. Table 4 summarizes these detected valuesand the relevant health-based levels of regulatory concern. The Agencythen further evaluated the three constituents which were detected in thewaste above their respective health-based levels. The Agency did not evaluatethe remaining constituents listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 because they werenot detected in CRF's waste using the appropriate analytical methods. TheAgency believes that it is inappropriate to evaluate non-detectable concentrationsof a constituent of concern if the non-detectable value was obtained usingthe appropriate analytical method. Specifically, if a constituent cannotbe detected (when using the appropriate analytical method), the Agencyassumes that the constituent is not present and therefore does not presenta threat to either human health or the environment. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s30,4.6,4.6 </C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Maximum Detected Hazardous Constituents in Scrubber Water and Levelsof Regulatory Concern (mg/L) </T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Concentrations </H1><H1>Levels of Regulatory Concern \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>0.16 </D><D>1.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane <D>0.0064 </D><D>0.00038 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>1.0 </D><D>0.05 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>1.0 </D><D>0.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">TCDD equivalent of detected TCDF \2\ <D>0.1x10</D>^9 <D>0.2x10</D>^9 <F>\1\ See ``Docket Report on Health-Based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket. </F><F>\2\ A TCDD equivalent is calculated by multiplying all detected concentrationsof tetra-, penta-, and hexa-chlorinated dioxins and furans by weightingfactors and summing them to estimate a 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent concentration.The calculation of TCDD toxicity equivalents, equivalent factors, and theirderivation are described in ``Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associatedwith Exposures to Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and -Dibenzofurans(CDDs and CDFs)'', U.S. EPA, Risk Assessment Forum, EPA/625/3-87/012, March,1987.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Comparing the concentrations of the detected constituents directly to thehealth-based standards provides a worst-case test of whether the wastecontrol be ingested directly. EPA believes it is highly unlikely that thistype of waste would ever be ingested directly. The detected barium and TCDF levels are below the health-based levels usedin delisting decision-making. The detected TCDF isomer is not chlorinatedat the most toxic 2, 3, 7, and 8 molecular positions of TCDF. The Agencyevaluated the detected concentration of TCDF (0.16 ppt) by applying theapplicable 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalent factor (0.001 for non-2,3,7,8-subtitutedcompounds) and comparing the resultant equivalent (0.16 parts per quadrillion(ppq)) to the Agency's health-based level for 2,3,7,8-TCDD (0.2 ppq). Becausethe resultant TCDD equivalent is below the health-based level, the Agencybelieves that the detected levels of TCDF are not of regulatory concern.The maximum detected lead concentration (1.0 mg/l) and maximum detectednickel concentration (1.0 mg/l) are above their respective health-basedlevels. In order to evaluate whether or not these detections cause thewaste to be hazardous, the Agency considered the various possible exposurescenarios for this type of waste. These scenarios included (1) spillageon the ground which could impact ground water, (2) discharge through sewersto a publicly owned treatment works (POTW), subsequent discharge to surfacewaters, and exposure through ingestion of surface water, and (3) dischargeto surface water under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System(NPDES), and exposure through ingestion of surface water. The Agency believes that each of these potential exposure scenarios wouldresult in the reduction of the detected levels of lead, nickel and 1,1-dichloroethanein CRF's waste to well below their respective health-based levels, particularlyin light of the finite, small volume petitioned wastewater involved. Specifically,the Agency considered the concentration reduction that might occur if thewaste were spilled on the ground and introduced directly to the groundwater (<T3>i.e,</T3> no unsaturated zone), by using the Agency's vertical andhorizontal spread (VHS) model (see 50 FR 7882, February 26, 1985 and 50FR 48896, November 27, 1985). The inputs to the model included the volumeof scrubber water and the maximum reported concentrations of lead, nickel,and 1,1-dichloroethane. As shown in Table 5, the results of the model (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the calculated compliance-point concentration) predict aground-water dilution factor of 32, resulting in maximum concentrationsat the compliance point (or hypothetical drinking water well) below thehealth-based levels used in delisting decision-making. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>5._<T4>VHS Model Compliance-Point Concentrations (ppm) Scrubber Water </T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Compliance-Point Concentrations </H1><H1>Levels of Regulatory Concern</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>0.005 </D><D>1.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane <D>0.0002 </D><D>0.0004</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.3 </D><D>0.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.03 </D><D>0.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">TCDD Equivalent <D>3.0x10</D>^12 <D>0.2x10</D>^9</ITAG></ITAG>The Agency conducted worst-case evaluations of potential exposure due todischarge to surface water via a POTW or NPDES permit. If the CRF scrubberwater were discharged under these worst-case conditions, the in-streammixing would rapidly reduce levels of lead, nickel, and 1,1-dichloroethaneto below analytical detection limits. For these scenarios, the wates mayalso be subject to additional treatment due to the applicable regulationsunder the Clean Water Act, including pretreatment standards and NPDES permitstandards. Furthermore, additional treatment would occur at water treatmentfacilities as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act prior to ingestion.For example, the typical dilution afforded by discharge to a POTW is illustratedby considering the average influent POTW flow of 2 million gallons perday (JRB Associates, ``Assessment of the Impacts of Industrial Dischargeson Publicly Owned Treatment Works'', prepared for the Office of Water,January 1982). If an average POTW were to reveive all of the CRF scrubbedwater in one day, the wastewater would be diluted by a factor of 285, resultingin maximum concentrations in the effluent below the health-based levelsused in delisting decision-making. Similarly, the typical dilution affordedby discharge of the scrubber water to surface waters in illustrated byconsidering typical instream dilution factors for industrial dischargers.The Agency calculated dilution factors for low stream flow conditions forover 23,000 industrial dischargers. The mean worst-case dilution associatedwith low stream flow rates (<T3>i.e,</T3> stream flow rate divided by discharge volume) is over 66,000.See the docket to this proposal for details of these analyses. The Agency concluded after reviewing CRF's petition that no other hazardousconstituents of concern other than those tested for are likely to be presentin CRF's waste. In addition, because of the nature of the waste, the Agencydoes not believe that CRF's waste exhibits any of the characteristics ofignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.23.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Conclusion </ITAG>The Agency believes that CRF's scrubber water is non-hazardous. The Agencybelieves that the constituent concentrations in the waste are not variable,consider the sampling procedures used by CRF to be adequate, and believesthat the reported analytical data are representative of the scrubber waterbecause: (1) The entire volume of petitioned waste was available for samplingand analysis (<T3>i.e.</T3>, waste composition variation in the further is not possible),and (2) the tanks were well mixed prior to and during sampling. The Agency,therefore, believes that the twenty six samples taken from the two blowdownstorage tanks adequately represent any variations which may occur in thescrubber water. As discussed above, the Agency believes that the threeconstituents which exceed health-based levels in the waste samples wouldbe subject to sufficient treatment, dilution, or attenuation in the possibleexposure scenarios to reduce detected levels to well below the health-basedlevels. The Agency, therefore, is proposing that CRF's waste be considered non-hazardous,as it should not present a harzard to either human health or the environment.The Agency proposes to grant an exclusion to the EPA Combustion ResearchFacility, located in Jefferson, Arkansas, for its scrubber water describedin its petition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F020. If the proposed rule becomeseffective, the scrubber water would no longer be subject to regulationunder 40 CFR Parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standards of 40 CFRPart 270. If made final, the exclusion will apply only to the stored wastes coveredby the original demonstration. Because this is a proposed one-time exclusionfor the volume of scrubber water covered in its petition and evaluationby the Agency, CRF may modify the operation of its incineration in thefuture without altering the regulatory status of the scrubber water proposedfor exclusion, so long as the scrubber water is not combined with hazardouswastes. Any new scrubber waters generated by CRF from the incinerationof hazardous wastes would remain hazardous unless and until a separatedelisting petition were granted. Although management of the waste covered by this petition would be relievedfrom Subtitle C jurisdiction upon final promulgation of an exclusion, thegenerator of a delisted waste must either treat, store, or dispose of thewaste in an on-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered toan off-site storage, treatment, or disposal facility, either of which ispermitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrialsolid waste. Alternatively, the delisted waste may be delivered to a facilitythat beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaimsthe waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recycling,or reclamation. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Effective Date </ITAG>This rule, if promulgated, will become effective immediately. The Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended Section 3010 of RCRA to allowrules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated communitydoes not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is thecase here, because this rule, if promulgated, would reduce the existingrequirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessaryhardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effectivedate six months after promulgation and the fact that a six-month deadlineis not necessary to achieve the purpose of Section 3010, EPA believes thatthis exclusion should be effective immediately upon promulgation. Thesereasons also provide a basis for making this rule effective immediately,upon promulgation, under the Administrative Procedures, Act, pursuant to5 U.S.C. 553(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This proposal to grant an exclusion is not major, since its effect, ifpromulgated, would be to reduce the overall costs and economic impact ofEPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction would be achievedby excluding waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists ofhazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facility to treat its waste asnon-hazardous. There is no additional impact, therefore, due to today'srule. This proposal is not a major regulation, therefore, no RegulatoryImpact Analysis is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rule-making for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.</T3>, small business, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions) The Administrator or delegated representative may certify,however, that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. This amendment, if promulgated, will not have an adverse economic impacton small entities since its effect would be to reduce the overall costsof EPA's hazardous waste regulations and would be limited to one facility.Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatoryflexibility analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
