The rating company said that not since the 1982 recession &quot;has the relative frequency of downgrades been so great.&quot; Moody's said that it made 2.2 downgrades for every upgrade in the latest period. In the 1988 period, the ratio was 1.7 to 1, while the ratio was 2.8 to 1 in 1982.    Moody's added that it expects a rise in corporate defaults, &quot;especially among highly leveraged speculative credits.&quot; It said that &quot;the consensus forecasts of a sluggish economy and slower earnings growth do not brighten the outlook for credit quality.&quot;    In the year's first nine months, Moody's downgraded 206 credit ratings involving $113.9 billion of debt; its 94 upgrades affected $63.9 billion of debt.    The rate of special events -- that is, mergers, leveraged buy-outs, restructurings or litigation -- dropped slightly in the third quarter. In dollar terms, the drop was greater as only $4.7 billion of bond ratings were cut because of a special event, compared with the first half's quarterly average of $17.4 billion. A Moody's economist noted that the higher stock prices raised the cost of takeovers, hostile or otherwise. </TEXT></DOC>
