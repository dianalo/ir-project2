A new state law, supposedly aimed at protecting the public from cancer-causing chemicals, includes an interesting concept known as citizen enforcement. Anyone can file suit charging a company with violating the law and &quot;shall be paid&quot; 25% of any fines. The law, called Proposition 65, is likely to raise unfounded health scares, hurt the state's economy and create courtroom havoc. Worse, environmentalist groups are hoping to establish similar programs in at least six other states.    California voters approved the Prop 65 ballot referendum by a 2-to-1 margin last November. The message that Californians are threatened by drinking water contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals was carried by barnstorming caravans of Hollywood performers and by the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund and the AFL-CIO. Republican Gov. George Deukmejian opposed the referendum as did the manufacturing, agriculture, electronics, aerospace and energy industries.    The first phase of the law took effect March 1, and the governor is already in court. The law required Gov. Deukmejian to publish a list of chemicals &quot;known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.&quot; The list later would become the basis for the law's reporting and enforcement requirements. But Prop 65 doesn't say how to define a carcinogen. Should these be limited to the chemicals known to cause cancer in humans, or expanded to include chemicals that produce tumors in laboratory animals exposed to extremely high doses? The governor appointed a scientific advisory board to address the problem.    It returned with a list of 29 chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects in humans and excluded the animal carcinogens. The environmentalist backers of Prop 65 then sued the governor. They of course wanted the animal carcinogens on the list. A Superior Court judge supported the environmentalist claims, calling the governor's interpretation of the law &quot;strained and tortured&quot; and ordering him to add 201 chemicals. Gov. Deukmejian is appealing. The elected state attorney general, John Van de Kamp, a Democrat, refused to support the administration in the lawsuit and the governor's office had to hire private counsel.    In fact, it is the environmentalists' logic that is strained and tortured. Viewed from their perspective, all of daily life has become a fearful and dangerous place.    A recent study led by Bruce Ames, a biochemist at the University of California at Berkeley and a member of the governor's panel, makes the following observation: &quot;No human diet can be entirely free of mutagens or agents that can be carcinogenic in rodent systems.&quot; For instance, tap water, bread, bacon, beer, wine, mushrooms, herbs and cola all contain low levels of natural carcinogens. Mr. Ames concludes that &quot;animal cancer tests cannot be used to predict absolute human risks&quot; and that &quot;we need to identify the important causes of human cancer among the vast number of minimal risks.&quot;    Prop 65, written by environmentalist lawyers, brushes scientific distinctions aside. Within a year, the law says, no one in California may be exposed to any detectable amount of the 230 chemicals on the list unless forewarned. California's food industry has asked for an exemption because Prop 65 would require warning labels on virtually all of the 15,000 food and beverage products marketed in the state. &quot;Mere washing food with water, or using water to mix with food,&quot; could leave small amounts of suspect chemicals, the industry says.    The open season of California's newest sport, bounty hunting, will begin on Nov. 1, 1988. Any citizen may bring suit to enforce the law. Companies face fines of $2,500 a day on each count, and from that the citizen enforcers get their 25% cut.    The Sierra Club claims that six other states are interested in adopting similar laws (Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, New York and Wisconsin). For now, the lines are drawn in California. As Prop 65 fills the state's courtrooms with defendants accused of purveying cancer, we finally may get a full public airing of this volatile subject. When is a carcinogen a real threat to human health and when is the supposed threat manufactured by exaggerated laboratory experiments on rats and mice? Calfornia also may teach the rest of the nation what the world will look like when the courts are opened up to bounty hunters. </TEXT></DOC>
