(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush, seeking ``to awaken a newspirit of environmentalism,'' appealed to Westerners today to helpreforest America and unveiled plans to train Peace Corps volunteersto help protect the environment in developing countries.   The president, on a cross-country trek through the centennialstates of South Dakota, Montana and Washington, preached the gospelof conservation and environmental ``stewardship'' to audiences hesaid needed little convincing.   In remarks prepared for delivery as he planted a centennial elmon the lawn of the Montana State Capitol, Bush spoke of ``the needto awaken a new spirit of environmentalism across America.''   And he said acid rain, global warming and the destruction ofBrazil's rain forests all demonstrate ``that protecting theenvironment is a global issue.''   Earlier, Bush appealed to South Dakotans as he planted an elm inSioux Falls to ``join the new greening of America'' by plantingtrees in their own backyards.   ``We need to reforest this bountiful land,'' Bush said.   Citing U.S. plans to ban ocean dumping of sewage by 1991 andprohibit release of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere by theyear 2000, Bush said, ``We can't stop there. We've got to work withthe rest of the world to preserve the planet.''   Starting next year, he announced, ``as part of their standardpreparation for duty, Peace Corp volunteers will be trained by the(Environmental Protection Agency) to deal with a full range ofenvironmental challenges: Water pollution prevention. Wastedisposal. Reforestation. Pesticide management.''</TEXT><NOTE>Following 2 grafs embargoed for 4:15 p.m. EDT</NOTE><TEXT>      Later, in an address to a five-state legislators conferenceinside the Montana Capitol, Bush said his new national anti-drugstrategy ``needs your help. We need the states to toughen theirlaws'' against narcotics and violent crime.   Bush, looking to next week's summit with the governors, also saidAmerica's schools are ``not making the grade. ... It is time forchange _ perhaps radical change _ to find new ways to improveeducational performance.''      End embargoed matter</TEXT><TEXT>      Bush was holding a news conference before departing Helena forSpokane, Wash., where he had another centennial tree-plantingscheduled Tuesday with Rep. Thomas Foley, the Democratic speaker ofthe House.   The president rode into the Sioux Falls Arena on a horse-drawncovered wagon to the cheers of 10,000 people. Sharing the rideaboard what Bush called ``Buckboard One'' were South Dakota Gov.George S. Michelson and a dozen students who had writtenprize-winning centennial essays.   Michelson, a Republican, hailed Bush's plans to hold an educationsummit with the governors next week and assured him, ``We in ruralAmerica are anxious to join in the war on drugs because we are notexempt from the problem.''   In a pitch for his proposals to toughen the Clean Air Act andreduce acid rain and smog, Bush said, ``It's not enough to stopdirtying the air. We've got to clean it up.   ``And to help do that, we should remember the oldest, cheapestand most efficient air purifier on Earth: trees,'' said thepresident, who was himself planting centennial trees here and inHelena today, and in Spokane, Wash., on Tuesday.   Last April, Bush planted his first centennial tree in Bismarck,N.D. Officials in that state have pledged to plant 100 million treesby the year 2000.   ``I challenge you to come up with a pledge of your own, to jointhe new greening of America by foresting South Dakota withcentennial trees,'' the president said.   ``It doesn't take a federal program. It doesn't take a newbureaucracy. And it sure doesn't take some fancy new study,'' hesaid. ``What it takes is a shovel. It is a family project you can doin your own homes, literally in your own back yards.''   Bush said the federal government planted just 340,000 acres oftrees last year, while private efforts, families and businesses``planted eight times that number _ enough to blanket an area almostthe size of Connecticut.''   He said tree-planting can exemplify his theme of volunteerism inAmerica, the so-called ``thousand points of light'' Bush evokedduring his election campaign.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wanted to usethe cross-country trip to build support for his $7.9 billionanti-drug strategy, which Democrats in Congress want to expand.   There was a small glitch with the tree Bush planted in Bismarcklast April 24. A local forester discovered that the tree,transplanted from the White House lawn, was carrying several tinylarvae of the gypsy moth _ the leaf-eating insect that hasdevastated elms in many Eastern and some Western states.   The larvae were removed and the centennial tree _ a descendant ofone planted by President John Quincy Adams _ was thoroughly sprayedwith insecticide.   In Sioux Falls today, Bush quipped, ``Not every president isblessed with a green thumb.'' Noting that the last centennial treehe planted had ``some kind of moth disease,'' he said, ``So far, I'mhaving about as much luck planting as I did fishing'' during hisrecent vacation in Maine.</TEXT></DOC>
