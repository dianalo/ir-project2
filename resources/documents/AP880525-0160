The alleged ringleader, Lou Vagnoni, 60, changed the locks onthe coin boxes, removed labels identifying the owner and changed acomputer chip inside, police said.   The telephones were valueda at $265,275; the amount of moneyreceived by operating them illegally could not be determined,police said.   Police Commissioner Kevin Tucker and District Attorney RonaldCastille charged Tuesday that Vagnoni paid Robert Paige, 31, andDavid Olsen, 22, to steal phones for him at $150 each throughoutPhiladelphia.   The stolen telephones were then operated by Need-a-Phone, aPhiladelphia pay telephone company in which Vagnoni is a silentpartner, police said. Other partners were unaware of theactivities, police said.   About one-quarter of the telephones belonged to Bell ofPennsylvania, while the remainder belonged to members of theCentral Atlantic Pay-Phone Association, a network of privatecompanies that operate pay telephones.   The three men were charged with 60 counts each of theft,conspiracy and unlawful use of computers.   The case broke in February when police Sgt. Terry Levins spottedPaige and Olsen dislodging a telephone and its steel base, saidDetective Philip Silverman. An investigation traced the men toVagnoni, he said.   ``Bystanders would spot the two men, but they appeared to beutility people,'' said Deputy Police Commissioner Willie Williams.   ``It was when the owners of the equipment came by to service thephones and found the equipment gone that a pattern began to benoticed.''</TEXT></DOC>
