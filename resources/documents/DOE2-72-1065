The reaction proceeds witha rate coefficient of 1.6 x 10/sup -9/ cm/sup 3/ s/sup -1/ and possessesthe following product distribution: C/sub 4/H/sub 2//sup +/ + S(0.45),HC/sub 4/S/sup +/ + H(0.30), C/sub 3/H/sub 2//sup +/ + CS(0.15), C/sub4/H/sup +/ + HS(0.10) and HCS/sup +/ + C/sub 3/H ({le}0.02). The sulphur-insertionproduct channel (HC/sub 4/S/sup +/ + H) produces an ion which, upon dissociativerecombination with electrons, leads to the radical C/sub 4/S. Calculationsshow that the abundance of C/sub 4/S produced in this manner in denseinterstellar clouds is {approx_equal} 8 per cent of the C/sub 2/S abundance.The C/sub 2/S radical has been previously observed in the interstellarcloud TMC-1 at a large fractional abundance with respect to H/sub 2/of 8 x 10/sup -9/. The C/sub 4/S radical may therefore be sufficientlyabundant in TMC-1 for observation.</TEXT></DOC>
