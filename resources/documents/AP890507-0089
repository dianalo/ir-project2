(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of space shuttle Atlantis' maincomputers quit Sunday, and although it came back on line, groundcontrollers had the astronauts install a spare for Monday'scritical re-entry and landing.   The flight crew dropped all other jobs to concentrate on the4{-hour job of installing the spare.   When the astronauts finished, Mission Control communicator TammyJernigan radioed, ``We send our congratulations. Good work. This isthe first time such a changeout has ever taken place in orbit.''   The extra work forced the crew members to delay their sleepperiod by an hour.   Atlantis has four operating computers, one backup and one spare.They control and monitor all spacecraft systems, and actually flythe shuttle most of the time. Atlantis could land Monday with onlyone computer operating, if necessary.   Flight director Ron Dittemore said the loss of the computerposed no threat to the mission.   ``We just don't have the confidence to run with it for entry,''he told reporters.   Shuttle commander David Walker told Mission Control, ``It lookslike GPC-4 has failed.'' He was directed to switch on GeneralPurpose Computer No. 3, the spare.   Walker then restored No. 4 to operation. ``It seems to beworking,'' he reported.   After ground experts determined there was a hardware problem,they decided to take no chances with the unit and ordered the spareinstalled in No. 4's place.   ``We'll terminate all the experiments and get at it,'' Walkersaid. Dropped were one sample run in a materials processing furnaceand photographs being taken of lightning and polluted areas onEarth.   Dittemore said computer No. 4's reactivation indicated thefailure was temporary.   ``There might be something floating in there that caused ashort,'' he said. ``We just know we don't want to trust it.''   ``The failure had no impact on the the flight,'' said MissionControl commentator Billie Deeson. ``The vehicle continues toperform normally.''   Walker and pilot Ronald Grabe checked shuttle systems Sunday,making sure they were ready for the hourlong plunge from 184 milesup through the atmosphere Monday. Landing is scheduled for 12:43p.m. PDT at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert.   CBS, NBC, and Cable News Network plan to provide live coverageMonday of the landing of the space shuttle Atlantis. ABC's coverageplans were incomplete Sunday.   Earlier, Walker had reported Atlantis was performing flawlesslyand that the Magellan spacecraft, a robot probe the crew launchedon a flight to Venus, was operating without a hitch.   If Atlantis' flight continues as well as it has, ``I'd sure giveit a 10 on my personal scale,'' Walker said. ``You couldn't ask fora better flying machine.''   The shuttle commander was answering questions beamed up fromreporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.   Walker remarked that the Magellan launch was significant becauseit shows ``the human race is continuing its exploration of thesolar system.''   Magellan was more than a half-million miles from Earth on Sundayon its 15-month journey to cloud-shrouded Venus, and projectscientists said all its systems were working well. Venus was morethan 158 million miles away.   When Magellan reaches Venus in August 1990, it is to fire intoorbit about the planet and map up to 90 percent of the surface witha high resolution radar system.   Astronaut Norman Thagard told reporters that the images obtainedby the $550 million Magellan project should tell scientists notonly about the history of Venus but also about the evolution of itssister planet, Earth.   He noted that Venus, shrouded in sulfuric acid clouds and acarbon dioxide atmosphere, has a runaway greenhouse effect that hasresulted in surface temperatures of 900 degrees Fahrenheit.   Many scientists fear that Earth is warming up and may experiencea severe greenhouse effect itself sometime in the future. To helpprevent that happening, Thagard said, ``we need to know themechanisms whereby these things occur.''   The Edwards forecast called for favorable weather, with highscattered clouds and visibility of seven miles.   NASA expected a relatively small crowd of 100,000 on hand forthe landing. Spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said Atlantis wasn't expectedto draw as many people as some past shuttle flights because it islanding on a weekday. An estimated 460,000 people watched Discoverytouch down March 18, a Saturday.   Mission specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Thagard beganpacking up and stowing equipment and experiments as the four-dayorbital journey neared an end.   The workload was limited because the Magellan probe and itsrocket booster, which together weighed 45,000 pounds, did not allowfor many experiments to be carried aboard.   Cleave said the light workload enabled her to concentrate moretime on a materials processing furnace where she melted andresolidified small samples of a metal called indium to see how theprocess works in weightlessness.   ``It's been working perfectly and we hope to bring back somegood indium crystals,'' she said.   Potential applications for such space-made materials includeadvanced electronic and optical devices devoid of the contaminationthat occurs naturally during processing in Earth's gravity.   Most of the other experiments involved photography of pollutedareas on Earth and of lightning strikes in the atmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
