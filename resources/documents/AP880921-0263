Justice John Paul Stevens granted an emergency request by theemployees and their union to suspend a federal judge's March 16order temporarily enjoining the strike.   Stevens' stay will remain in effect until the high court acts ona pending appeal in the case.   But James Brunkenhoefer, national legislative director of theUnited Transportation Union, said late Wednesday that he knew of nounion plans to go on strike over the proposed sale of 208 miles ofthe rail line in Wisconsin. Workers fear the loss of more than 200jobs if the sale takes place.   Officials of Candamp;NW, a leading Midwestern freight hauler that alsoruns commuter trains serving 40,000 people a day in Chicago'ssuburbs, also predicted there would be no strike as a result ofWednesday's ruling.   ``The effect of the ruling is difficult to determine at thistime,'' Candamp;NW spokesman James M. Foote said in a telephone interviewlate Wednesday. ``We will have to discuss the change in thesituation with the buyer in the near future.''   Candamp;NW plans to sell the rail line _ from Milwaukee to Green Bay,Wis., _ to a newly formed railroad, FRVR Corp., a subsidiary ofChicago-based Itel Corp.   The Railway Labor Executives Association had filed a motion tostop the sale, arguing that the railroad was obligated to negotiateover the effects of the sale on employees.   But the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month thatCandamp;NW Corp. could sell the track without giving labor unions a voicein the decision.   The sale of the line is not related to another controversy overtrain crew sizes that caused a brief strike against the Candamp;NW inAugust.   An estimated 2,600 rail employees went on strike for a few hoursSept. 9 against the Candamp;NW over another issue involving possiblelayoffs of brakemen.   ``We're dealing with two unrelated issues,'' said Robert ReppeJr., president of UTU Local 577, which represents about 420 unionmembers in the Chicago area.   Both Reppe and Brunkenhoefer said they did not expect any striketo result from Stevens' ruling. Brunkenhoefer said he expected themain effect of the ruling would be that the Candamp;NW would not rush tocomplete the Wisconsin track sale until labor and legal issues werefurther resolved.   The railroad and the United Transportation Union have beenbattling for more than a year over the size of crews on Candamp;NWfreight trains. But that dispute is not directly at issue in theemergency request acted upon Wednesday by Stevens.</TEXT></DOC>
