Sophia Casey likely was questioned about what her husband mighthave told her before his death last year about the sale of U.S.arms to Iran to obtain the release of American hostages and whetherhe mentioned anything about the diversion of proceeds to theContras.   Casey, who died of pneumonia on May 6, 1987, after sufferingfrom brain cancer, was CIA director when U.S. arm were sold to Iranin 1985 and 1986.   The agency provided logistical support to covert operations tohelp the Contras. Those operations were coordinated by formerNational Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North.   North told Congress that he was acting with Casey's approval andthat the former CIA director recommended that he recruit retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to set up the private supplynetwork because Secord had experience in special operations.   Secord, who set up secret Swiss bank accounts to funnel privatedonations to the Contras, also helped broker the sale of U.S. armsto Iran with his partner, Albert Hakim.   North told Congress last summer that Casey saw the diversion aspart of an effort to create a ``stand-alone'' or ``off-the-shelf''enterprise that could engage in covert activities outsidecongressional review.   Mrs. Casey's testimony comes as the grand jury appears to bepreparing to return criminal indictments against the targets of theinvestigation, including North, Secord, Hakim and former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter.   Mrs. Casey, who lives in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y., last fall disputeda published account by journalist Bob Woodward that Casey knewabout the diversion to the Contra rebels.   In his book ``Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA,'' Woodward saidthat during an interview in the hospital Casey acknowledged knowingabout the diversion.   In a Sept. 28, 1987, interview, Mrs. Casey said her husbandnever told her of the diversion and expressed doubt that he knewabout it.   She termed ``absolute blasphemy'' Woodward's account that Caseyhad criticized President Reagan as ``lazy and distracted.''   ``He's lying about that,'' Mrs. Casey told The Associated Press.   She described her husband as ``a team player'' and a ``greatpatriot who would never do anything to harm his president.''   Mrs. Casey also expressed outrage at Woodward's report thatCasey was ``struck by the overall passivity of the president.''   ``Bill would never say that about the president,'' she said.``Bill loved Reagan and they were very close. It's been veryhurtful.''</TEXT></DOC>
