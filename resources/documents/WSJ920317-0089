That's a modest aim in good years, and this isfinally one in the Sierras.   The past decade hasn't been kind. Drought denied theMammoth Mountain Ski Area -- once the nation's largest -- adecent winter cover for the past six years. Avolcano/earthquake scare in the early 1980s chased away a lotof business, and two national recessions cut into the marketfor a sport that costs $35 a head just for a day's lift pass.</LP><TEXT>   Thus was interrupted the heady growth of the Los Angelesarea's favorite schussing ground. Now Mammoth Lakes, withbeds for nearly 50,000 residents and visitors in place, isregrouping for a possible reach into that marketing realmknown as the &quot;destination resort.&quot; That's if there's no moreproblem with some mule deer, a fish called the tui chub andthe slight matter of $50 million.   That's Tom Dempsey's estimated development cost for hisSnowcreek ski area, to be built within gondola's range of theexisting slopes. Mr. Dempsey last month received a criticalgo-ahead from the U.S. Forest Service after years offrustration that lead him to &quot;guarantee&quot; that his will be&quot;the last ski area built in California.&quot;   The developer believes his battles with environmentalistsare now largely won, but they are repeated nationwide, amajor reason why only one significant ski resort -- thejust-opened and already-crowded Whitetail in Pennsylvania,serving Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington -- has startedup in the past 10 years.   Other factors are demographic change and lift-priceescalation, partly to cover liability lawsuits. Industryoptimists believe that ski resorts, by riding a baby miniboomthat is reaching its early teens and by welcoming this newgeneration's penchant for snowboards (akin to skateboardingor surfing), can get new legs. That might be critical to Mr.Dempsey's ability to finance Snowcreek, in which he says he'salready put $1.5 million.   Dempsey Construction Corp. has built much of the Mammothcommunity, as well as structures in other Western resorttowns. But its 57-year-old chief acknowledges that the placehas an image as a &quot;truck stop&quot; compared with the villageatmosphere of its high-brow competitors, even Vail, whichmore than a decade ago displaced it as the No. 1 U.S. skivenue. Apres-ski, Mammoth is just commercial strips. One signof its missing clientele: You'd have to go 100 miles north,to the playgrounds of Lake Tahoe, to find a newsstand copy ofThe Wall Street Journal.   That's what Mr. Dempsey hopes to overcome with Snowcreek.Though as spacious as Mammoth Mountain, it would have only athird of the skier capacity, accenting expert terrain. Bycontrast, Mammoth, although it has a &quot;face&quot; full ofchallenges, is a mass marketer. Some of its trails are aswide as 500 feet.   Even with an improved Mammoth airport, Mr. Dempsey expectsto draw mainly from Southern California, which he sayssupplies 96% of Mammoth's business now. It's a five-hourdrive from Los Angeles, but while that region mushroomed inpopulation during the 1980s, the skiers went elsewhere -- toplaces such as Sun Valley, Idaho, where Mr. Dempsey, too, hasa second home to which he pilots his family most weekends.Snow quality explains part of the shift, but it also reflectsan urge to escape the LA weekenders.   If Mr. Dempsey succeeds in luring the high-end vacationtraffic to Mammoth Lakes, it will cap nearly a lifetimeassociation with the community. He was a ski racer here inhis youth and tells of helping Dave McCoy, the MammothMountain operator, get that area open in the 1950s. The tworemain close, and hope to link their facilities in somefashion. (Piggybacking a smaller, upmarket ski area on alarger existing facility has been successful at such placesas Deer Valley/Park City, Utah, and Beaver Creek/Vail.)   With the profits from his contracting business, Mr.Dempsey in 1978 bought 355 acres at the base of Sherwin Bowl,where he had helicopter-skied. He's already built theSnowcreek condominiums and golf course, butslopes-to-the-doorsteps are key to building out the area withpremium hotels and restaurants.   That's why he hooked up with the original Sherwinapplicant in the mid-80s and grew to be the dominant partner.The years have soured him on environmental pretenses. &quot;When Iwas a kid, I belonged to the Sierra Club. No more]&quot; he says.   Mr. Dempsey and Bob Wood, district winter sportsspecialist of the Forest Service, see Sherwin as part of aprolonged skirmish with ski-development foes in the southernSierras. Disney Corp.'s plans to build Mineral King, a resortjutting into Sequoia National Park, were quashed. Betteralternatives were successively raised and then vetoed bylocal chapters of green groups, which prefer wilderness.   Sherwin/Snowcreek was first surveyed for skiing in 1965.The environmental review just completed took five years. &quot;Itis the most studied ski resort ever planned,&quot; contends Mr.Dempsey.   Migration of mule deer has been the most prominentobstacle. Mr. Dempsey says they cross the grounds for about45 minutes each spring, and that he'll accommodate them. Heclaims the California Department of Fish and Game, which alsocontested him on this point, is content all the while to lethunters shoot the deer en masse from the road leading intotown.   The guppylike tui chub, meanwhile, was the bane of thenearby fish hatchery because it carries parasites that preyon trout. With its listing as an endangered species, however,eradication efforts turned to preservation, and fears wereexpressed that its habitat would be disturbed by water usetriggered by the resort.   Nonetheless, most of the community is behind Mr. Dempsey'sproject, according to past Mayor Gary Flynn. Mammoth Lakes,and California for that matter, could use an economic rushfrom taking full advantage of abundant recreationalresources. The Sherwin opportunity ought to be on exhibit forthose studying the regulatory drag on the state's business.   Of course, demand matters as well as supply. Alpine skiinghas gone nowhere since 1979, even as other outdoorsactivities have taken off. Hundreds of lesser ski areas haveclosed. But Mr. Dempsey isn't ready to rack up theRossignols.   Barring a reversal of policy in Washington, or litigationhe doesn't expect, he need only scale a financial summit now.Bank loans are out these days, so Mr. Dempsey thinks he'lltry a public offering.   In a few years he will know whether, as a ski racer wouldwish, it was all downhill from here.</TEXT></DOC>
