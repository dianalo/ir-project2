(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mayor was acquitted Tuesday of chargeshe misused city money and swindled three businessmen.   A St. Louis County District Court jury reached the verdict aftermore than six hours of deliberations following two weeks oftestimony.   Mayor John Fedo sat motionless while the verdicts were read, thenembraced his attorney, Douglas Sauter, who was crying.   ``I don't think anyone could really describe the experience, soI'm not going to try,'' Fedo said after leaving the courtroom.   ``Everything that needed to be said was said in the courtoom,''the mayor said, adding that he'd like to thank the people of Duluthand tell them he'd now be ``back to work.''   ``We have finally finished the election of 1987,'' Fedo said,referring to his contention that the charges against him werepolitically motivated by multimillionaire Jeno Paulucci and Fedo'sother political adversaries.   Prosecutor Vernon Swanum would not comment, nor would jurors.   Fedo faced eight felony charges and one gross misdemeanor countcharging him with falsifying travel expenses in 1985 and withpocketing $13,500 he solicited from three Duluth businessmen.   The travel-record charges stemmed from 1985, when, prosecutorscontended, Fedo made up names of guests when he actually dined atcity expense with Lory Cossi, who is now his wife. Fedo admittedinaccuracies but said they resulted from failing to remember who wasthere when asked by auditors months after the meals.   No witnesses testified they saw Fedo spending the $13,500 fromthe three businessmen on himself.</TEXT></DOC>
