RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, ruling against a child whosuffered brain damage from repeated beatings by his father, saidWednesday states generally may not be sued even if they negligentlyfail to shield people from abuse by others.   The 6-3 decision said public officials have no constitutionalduty to protect those who are not in state custody. The court saidthere is no legal recourse even in the ``undeniably tragic'' casewhere officials were aware of the beatings but did not intervene.   The court killed a lawsuit in behalf of Joshua DeShaney, aWisconsin boy who since age 4 has been profoundly retarded and isexpected to remain institutionalized for the rest of his life.   Child welfare officials and the state were sued by Joshua'smother, Melody DeShaney, on grounds the boy was deprived of libertywithout due process.   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court,said, ``Nothing in the language of the due process clause itselfrequires the state to protect the life, liberty and property of itscitizens against invasion by private actors.''   ``Because ... the state had no constitutional duty to protectJoshua against his father's violence, its failure to do so _ thoughcalamitous in hindsight _ simply does not constitute a violation ofthe due process clause,'' he said.   In an unusual emotional dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmunexclaimed, ``Poor Joshua! It is a sad commentary upon American lifeand constitutional principles ... that this child, Joshua DeShaney,now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundlyretarded'' and without an opportunity to sue the state.   Blackmun accused the court of ``sterile formalism'' for failingto grant Joshua and his mother an opportunty to seek damages fromthe state.   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall also dissented.   Brennan said, ``My disagreement with the court arises from itsfailure to see that inaction can be every bit as abusive of power asaction, that oppression can result when a state undertakes a vitalduty and then ignores it.''   Rehnquist rejected arguments that the state had a duty to protectJoshua because it once had given him shelter and because socialworkers suspected he was being abused.   Only ``when the state takes a person into its custody and holdshim there against his will'' does the Constitution require officialsto take responsibility for the individual's safety and well-being,Rehnquist said.   ``While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshuafaced in the free world, it played no part in their creation nor didit do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them,'' he said.   ``The state does not become the permanent guarantor of anindividual's safety by having once offered him shelter,'' Rehnquistadded.   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens,Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   The suit in Joshua's behalf was filed against the WinnebagoCounty, Wis., Department of Social Services and two of its employees.   The boy first came to the attention of the welfare agency when hewas brought to a hospital in 1983 at age 4 with cuts and bruises.   Joshua was returned to the custody of his father, Randy DeShaneyof Neenah, Wis., and a social worker, Ann Kemmeter, was assigned tothe case.   The boy's mother had divorced DeShaney and was living inCheyenne, Wyo., at the time.   Ms. Kemmeter visited the DeShaney home numerous times, includingon March 7, 1984, when she was told that several days earlier Joshuahad fainted in the bathroom for no apparent reason. According tocourt records, she did not ask to see the boy after being told hewas asleep.   The following day Joshua was treated at a hospital for headinjuries that destroyed half his brain.   Ms. Kemmeter later said, ``I just knew the phone would ring someday and Joshua would be dead.''   The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced totwo to four years in prison. He was freed on parole after servingless than two years.   In another case, the high court said states may not prohibitpolitical party leaders from endorsing primary election candidates.By a vote of 8-0, the court said such a California law impermissiblyinfringes constitutionally protected freedom of speech.   The court also struck down California laws limiting the terms ofoffice for party leaders and dictating the makeup of state partycentral committees.   The court also heard arguments in a Pittsburgh case over thevalidity of religious displays in government buildings. A decisionis expected by July.</TEXT></DOC>
