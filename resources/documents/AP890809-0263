The bill also imposes tough new standards on savings and loaninstitutions and triggers the most sweeping overhaul of theregulatory bureaucracy in 50 years.   Along with the late-morning signing of the measure, thepresident was ordering his administration to gear up to close ormerge hundreds of failed institutions. The first meeting of a newboard to oversee their holdings was called immediately after theceremony.   Bush said the measure, which received final congressionalapproval Saturday, ``says to tens of millions of savings and loandepositors: you will not be the victims of others' mistakes.''   Among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady, Housing and Urban Development SecretaryJack Kemp and key Capitol Hill sponsors, including Sen. Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairmenof the congressional banking committees.   To the president's right were mock-ups of the new emblems thatthe institutions will put on their doors to assure depositors theirmoney is safe.   One proclaims in bold, white letters against a gold background:``Deposits Federally Insured _ Backed Up by the Full Faith andCredit of the United States Government.''   ``This legislation comes to grips with the problems facing oursavings and loan industry. It will safeguard and stabilizeAmerica's financial system,'' Bush declared.   He called the measure, a variation on a bailout plan hesubmitted to Congress on Feb. 6, ``historic legislation.''   ``It is responsive and responsible. And for that, I salute theCongress,'' the president said.   Immediately after the signing ceremony, Brady was conducting thefirst meeting of the board overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp.The RTC was created to manage the sale of sour loans andrepossessed real estate the government is inheriting from ailingsavings and loans.   The RTC board, whose members also include Kemp and FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, will approve operating policiesfor the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency charged withmanaging the bailout. It also will appoint top staff members tooversee the FDIC.   The FDIC already has taken over 262 failed thrifts, and thefirst deals to wipe out their losses and put them in the hands ofnew owners could come as early as this week.   Earlier, the Treasury Department announced plans to borrow thefirst $5 billion installment of the bailout Thursday and said itintends to raise an additional $15 billion within eight weeks.   Analysts say the bill, the first major legislative initiative ofBush's presidency, will touch the lives of anyone who pays taxes,deposits money in a bank or thrift or owns real estate,particularly in the Southwest.   The savings and loan industry will emerge leaner and moreclosely regulated, bu perhaps no better able to earn a profit,analysts say.   By providing the money to close failed thrifts, which must payhigh interest rates to attract deposits, the bill should allowremaining institutions, including banks, to lower their rates.   The massive sale of real estate by the government could endangerproperty values in already fragile markets in oil-producing statesin such as Texas and Oklahoma.   Thrifts that can't measure up to tougher financial andaccounting standards face takeover by government regulators ormerger with bigger and stronger institutions _ including commercialbanks, which for the first time will be permitted to buy healthysavings and loans.   ``In five years I expect there'll be less than a thousandthrifts,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst inAlexandria, Va. Currently there are about 3,000 savings and loaninstitutions.   The prospects for thrifts that remain are mixed. Optimists pointout that the bill, by lowering deposit rates, will make it easierfor healthy institutions to earn a profit.   Also, it should restore public confidence in the government'sguarantee of savers' accounts up to $100,000, helping stem a recordoutflow of deposits this year.   ``The industry that is going to emerge from this is going to befewer in number, but certainly stronger,'' said Barney R. Beeksma,chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry'slargest trade group.   Pessimists, however, say the industry's contribution to thebailout will pinch thrift earnings. They also note that the billwill force savings and loans to concentrate more heavily on safer,but less lucrative, home mortgage lending just as the economy andreal estate markets are entering a slow-growth period at best and arecession at worst.   ``I think it's exactly the wrong thing to do,'' said economistPaul Getman of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecastingcompany. ``It's consigning the thrift industry to lowprofitability, at least over the next two or three years.''</TEXT></DOC>
