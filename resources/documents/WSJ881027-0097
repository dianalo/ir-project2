Sease (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   Megadeal takeover fever is rising on Wall Street, but it isn't running up the temperature of the overall stock market.    Trading volume is slightly higher and prices have climbed sufficiently for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to set a new post-crash high of 2183.50 last week. Still, the market hasn't decisively broken out of its 250-point trading range and shows no signs of an embryonic bull move.    Volume isn't all that great, either. Keith F. Pinsoneault, director of research at Sutro andamp; Co., San Francisco, asserts that trading activity aside from takeover stocks remains subdued.    For example, on Monday 170.6 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But fully 12% of that, about 21.2 million shares, was in the above-average volume of only a half dozen known or rumored takeover stocks.    So why hasn't the frenzied buying of big, brand-name stocks boosted the market more? Brokers and others with a vested interest in selling stocks argue that with billions of dollars in cash from completed deals chasing a shrinking supply of stock, prices are bound to go higher.    Some skeptics argue that such a scenario works only if those billions come back into the market instead of going into bonds, real estate or certificates of deposit. The stock market's lackluster volume this year is ample evidence to them that investors' demand for stocks has dropped as fast or faster than the supply.    The supply side of the supply-and-demand argument is easy to see. In the past 10 days alone, proposed mergers or leveraged buy-outs totaling more than $30 billion were announced. When completed, those deals will have removed millions of shares from the stock market while putting billions of dollars of cash in the hands of investors. Altogether such activity is expected to produce well over $100 billion in cash payments to investors this year.    And there isn't any question that mergers, leveraged buy-outs and stock buy-backs have had a salutary effect on stock prices this year. Steven Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs, figures the various deals completed so far in 1988 can be credited with close to one-third of the 15% gain in stock prices this year. That estimate is based not only on the premiums paid for takeover targets, but also the stock price rises of other companies in the same industry that often accompany a takeover bid.    What the estimate doesn't include is the unknown quantity of money paid to shareholders in those deals that comes back into the stock market. Whatever the number is, Mr. Einhorn argues it's big and has a favorable effect.    The $30 billion in cash that will flow into investors' hands in the next few weeks as the current crop of deals close &quot;is one and a half times the {uninvested} cash in all the equity mutual funds,&quot; he says, &quot;and it will be allocated among fewer shares. That helps explain why the market has been able to hit successive new highs since last October while the breadth -- the ratio of rising to falling stocks -- &quot;hasn't been very good.&quot;    Some think that as brokers and portfolio strategists begin to discuss the effect of lots of cash chasing fewer shares, the beneficial effects are likely to accelerate.    &quot;So far it's been an arithmetic effect,&quot; says A.C. Moore, director of research for Argus Research. &quot;But to the extent that this gets talked about and publicized it will become psychologically helpful and induce more participation in the market.&quot;    However, Michael Steinhardt, who runs Steinhardt Partners, a New York investment firm, thinks that too much attention is being paid to the supply side of the equation -- the surging amount of cash and the reduced number of shares -- and not enough to the demand for stocks. &quot;Why in the face of the extraordinary decline in the amount of stock available since the crash has the market not done better?&quot; he asks.    The problem, he suggests, is simply lack of demand. Not only are individual investors avoiding the stock market, but some of the very companies that are making expensive bids for other companies or going private in high-priced LBOs are at the same time taking a very conservative approach to their own investment portfolios. &quot;They're telling their pension funds 'we want a 9% fixed return and don't even talk about stocks',&quot; he says.    James Freeman, a managing director at First Boston Corp., agrees that demand for stocks is at an ebb. He points out that from 1984 to 1987 there was a sharp reduction in the amount of stock available while demand remained strong. The result, he said, was the big runup in prices that preceded the crash last October.    Since the crash, shares have continued to disappear at an accelerating rate, he says, but demand has almost dried up as institutions, individuals and pension funds sell stocks and hoard cash. The only big buyers of stock today are corporations.    Although Mr. Freeman and others point out that there is a potential for stock prices to advance, few see that happening before the current merger mania runs its course. Mr. Einhorn, for example, believes the current frenzy of mergers and buy-outs will begin to slow soon. &quot;Stock prices aren't cheap and corporate debt capacity is more limited,&quot; he adds. </TEXT></DOC>
