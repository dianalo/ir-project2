The Sun reported today that IBM acknowledged last week it hadinadvertantly sold the government used equipment mislabeled as newin 1984 and 1985.   IBM said it voluntarily alerted the government to the error assoon as it was discovered in February 1987 and has been cooperatingin a General Services Administration investigation. The companyattributed the mix-up to administrative error.   The Sun said a second case involving used IBM equipment is alsonow under review, this one in connection with a $544 million Navycontract awarded to Electronic Data Systems Corp., a major supplierof IBM equipment, in August 1987. EDS specializes in designingsophisticated computer systems.   The contract under review called for EDS to supply computersoftware, hardware and services to the Navy.   Under the EDS bid, IBM hardware and software accounted for about$134 million of the total $544 million award.   According to unnamed sources quoted by the Sun, Navy personnelcontacted the FBI after discovering the IBM equipment were used andnot new as required by the contract.   The newspaper said the FBI is investigating to determine whetherthe mix-up was intentional and whether blame belongs to EDS, IBM orthe Navy.
