Itproves to be as smoothly written and satisfying as any of itspredecessors in this interesting and well done series.   Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee are the Navajotribal policemen assigned to solve Mr. Hillerman's puzzles,cases made more baffling and exotic by the Indian beliefs andtraditions woven through the narratives. The veteran Leaphornand the somewhat impulsive Chee alternated as detectives inMr. Hillerman's earlier books. For the past three titles thetwo characters have been loosely paired, working alongparallel lines toward the same conclusions.</LP><TEXT>   Chee and Leaphorn eventually are partnered in this newbook as well. Each is thinking of leaving police work nearthe beginning of &quot;Coyote Waits.&quot; Leaphorn, a recent widower,is contemplating retirement. Chee, guilty over hisinadvertent failure to prevent the death of a fellow officer,is considering turning in his badge.   At first, it seems, there's no mystery at all. Chee'sfellow officer has been killed, but a suspect -- drunk, andin possession of the murder weapon -- has been immediatelyarrested, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (in chargeof felonies committed on the reservation) is convinced of hisguilt. The suspect's lawyer, though, is a friend of Chee's,and she prompts the policeman into seeing if there might bemore to this matter than meets the FBI. Leaphorn, unbeknownstto Chee, begins his own investigation into the same events asa favor to the suspect's niece, a member of his late wife'sfamily clan.   What's gradually uncovered is a skein of connectionsbetween the suspect (a part-time shaman), rival academics whoused him as a source for native lore, a possibly crazedpainter who's furtively defacing desert rock formations, aVietnamese family receiving CIA protection, and somehistorically interesting corpses that may have been preservedfor decades up a remote canyon pass.   Here, as in all of Mr. Hillerman's tales, the ways thingsare revealed are as interesting as the things themselves.Navajo conversational etiquette requires patience and tactfrom the listener and affords the speaker a good deal ofdiscretionary space. This leads to interrogation sessionsrather different from those on &quot;Miami Vice.&quot; In charting thenuances of such interchanges, Mr. Hillerman conveys moregenuine tension and suspense than are contained in any numberof ammo-laden thrillers. When a vital fact is at lastdiscovered or a crucial event occurs, it comes with thesudden force of a thunderclap above a quiet mesa.   As usual, Mr. Hillerman conveys wonderfully the weatherand geography of his Southwestern setting. His very prose --lean sentences without an apparent ounce of fat -- seems tomirror the stark New Mexico terrain.   Less compelling is the latest entry in another popularseries, the Spenser private-eye novels of Robert B. Parker.&quot;Stardust&quot; (Putnam, 256 pages, $18.95) has the sardonicSpenser trying to protect a foul-mouthed alcoholic TV actressfrom an unknown someone who may or may not be harrassing her.The actress is Jill Joyce, &quot;America's honeybun,&quot; asmall-screen star for 20 years and possessor of &quot;the highestTVQ of anyone now on television.&quot;   Surly, sluttish and often soused before noon, Joyce isplaying &quot;a woman shrink&quot; in a show being filmed on locationin Spenser's Boston. It's hard to believe such an indiscreetand unpleasant character could hide her checkered past andpreserve her wholesome image in an era of tell-all tabloidsand gossip snoops. It's also tough to imagine even a nastystar surviving for two decades without acquiring some sort ofsupport entourage.   Be that as it may, Spenser hires on to look into thethreats Joyce supposedly has been receiving. Things get moreserious when the star's stunt double is found murdered on theset. Spenser's cohort, Hawk, is deputized to keep an eye onthe client, while the PI hunts up suspects on both coasts.When the murder finally is solved, its resolution hinges onthe killer's having read news accounts that are news to thereader, too.   The hero's better one-liners meanwhile prompt a fewchuckles. (On a postmodern house in the country, all slabsand angles and slants: &quot;The place looked like it had beendesigned by Georges Braque while drunk.&quot; On his own clippedspeech: &quot;I felt like I was trapped in a Hemingway shortstory. If I got any more cryptic I wouldn't be able to talkat all.&quot;) A poignant ending somewhat redeems a ratherlistless story.   For the most part, though, the obligatory wisecracks --the put-downs, the put-ons, the snappy comebacks -- and thesexy banter between Spenser and his girlfriend, Dr. SusanSilverman, all seem familiar and forced. The hero comes offless as a believable private investigator than a parody of afictional gumshoe. This tough guy's charm is wearing thin.   ---   Mr. Nolan is a contributing editor at Los AngelesMagazine.</TEXT></DOC>
