Soldiers were fighting soldiers around Tiananmen Square and insouthwestern Beijing, the sources said on condition of anonymity. AChinese source reported seeing seven wounded soldiers lying on astreet in southeastern Beijing.   Hundreds of people were killed Saturday when troops shot, beatand crushed students and other protesters who had been occupyingTiananmen Square since May 13, demonstrating for democratic reformsand against corruption.   Chinese and diplomatic sources said the 38th Army, which iscommissioned with defending the Beijing area, was preparing to moveagainst the 27th Army, which carried out Saturday's attack.   The 38th was originally told to enforce martial law imposed byPremier Li Peng on May 20, but refused to send troops into the city.   The 27th is based in Hubei province south of Beijing. Each corpsis made up of three divisions and has between 35,000 and 40,000 men.   The Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong quoted what it said wereinformed sources in Beijing as saying a young guard shot Li in thethigh Sunday in the Great Hall of the People. It said Li's woundwas not severe and that his assailant was immediately shot to death.   By late Monday, the defensive positions taken by troopsoccupying central Beijing clearly indicated their focus switchedfrom shooting citizens to preparing for a battle.   Troops occupied bridges and other strategic locations going intothe square and shot at cars and pedestrians trying to get through.   Thousands of troops and tanks occupying the square lined upalong the northern perimeter facing the former imperial palace.Other tanks took up new positions on key intersections off the100-acre square.   Gunfire could be heard from behind the palace, and artilleryshelling was heard in a far northwest suburb of the city.   Nine tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers left the squareTuesday morning, heading eastward.   At least three people died and four were injured Monday astroops armed with machine guns and automatic rifles kept upsporadic, indiscriminate firing.   Chinese witnesses said the dead included a man machine-gunnedfrom his chin to his stomach. The wounded included a girl shot inthe chest when troops charged up a narrow residential street.   Anti-government disturbances were reported in Shanghai, Nanjing,Changsha and at least three cities in the northeast.   In Shanghai, China's most populous city, all publictransportation stopped Monday as people moved buses and otherbarricades into intersections. Thousands of people joined funeralmarches through Nanjing on Monday, and students blocked majorstreets to prevent buses from running.   Chinese sources said Defense Minister Qin Jiwei was stripped ofpower for opposing the decision of senior leader Deng Xiaoping toend seven weeks of student demonstrations with military force.   Despite repeated announcements on Chinese television praisingthe military action against the people of the capital, no nationalleader has appeared in public or on television to takeresponsibility for the military takeover of Beijing.   The student unrest triggered a major power struggle in theChinese leadership, with Deng, Li and other conservative hardlinersgaining the upper hand and reportedly stripping power fromCommunist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who favored makingconcessions to the students.   There was a chorus of condemnation from around the world at thearmy's attack on the demonstrators. In Washington, President Bushsaid he would suspend all military sales and visits of Chinesemilitary leaders but announced that diplomatic ties would not besevered.   The American, British and other embassies were evacuating someof their nationals from Beijing universities out of fear troopswould move onto campuses to stifle anti-government activities.   A Beijing University student said, ``Many of the (Chinese)students have left the dormitories to go home or to find shelter inBeijing because they fear an imminent attack by the army.''   The Hong Kong government sent a special flight Monday toevacuate residents of the British colony.   Residents in Beijing spent the day preparing for food shortages,with lines forming for milk, oil, soy sauce and other staples.   Blockades of buses and burning vehicles made major streetsimpassable, and many Beijing residents stayed home from work out offear of the roaming bands of soldiers.   One convoy of 50 to 100 military trucks rumbled through thediplomatic quarter firing indiscriminately, a U.S. Embassy officialsaid. More than 40 soldiers later swaggered down the main streetbordering the diplomatic section, firing in the air. Residentsscattered but reappeared to shout jeers after the soldiers.   Beijing residents enraged by the shooting defied the heavilyarmed military by blockading streets and vowing continued supportfor the pro-democracy students. Many wore black armbands to honorthe dead.   ``It's not over, it's just getting started,'' said a 38-year-oldeducator outside the main gate of Beijing Normal University, wherehundreds of people gathered to back the students.   ``The people have just found out what democracy is reallyabout.''   On man climbed on top of the lead vehicle of a 20-tank convoy.He got down but again moved to block its way when the tank tried todrive around him. Several people had to drag him to safety.   The official media continued to defend the military crackdown onunarmed civilians as a justified battle against ``thugs'' and``ruffians.''   The national television station late Monday showed footage ofyoung people throwing rocks at troops and military personnelcarriers entering the city.   One segment showed people attacking a stalled truck, heavingrocks through the windshield and saying the two soldiers insidewere beaten to death.</TEXT></DOC>
