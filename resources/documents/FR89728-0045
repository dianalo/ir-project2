These rates wouldbe applicable to the BCA projects and the SLCA/IP. Following the analysisof the public comments received as a result of this proposal, Western hasfinalized these rates. These rates are applicable only to discretionary or coordination salesthat are short-term commitments of 1 year or less. Coordination sales representshort-term firm or nonfirm power that is available over and above othermarketing obligations. Western has joined the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP), and these ratesare patterned after the WSPP rates whereby the actual rate for each transactionis negotiated and mutually agreed to by the buyer and the seller. On April 27, 1989, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approveda 1-year extension of the WSPP, through April 30, 1990. The FERC encouragedthe WSPP members to file for a temporary extension or a permanent poolby January 1, 1990, with lower pool-wide price ceilings for generationand transmission services. When Western joins the WSPP, current and futureprice ceilings for WSPP members will apply to all of Western's WSPP transactionstaking place under these rates. Timely implementation of the rates for Economy Energy Service, Short-TermFirm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service, and Nonfirm TransmissionService will improve Western's BCA projects and SLCA/IP operations by allowingthem to offer a wider range of services.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mr. Robert C. Fullerton, Director,Division of Marketing and Rates, Western Area Power Administration, P.O.Box 3402, Golden, CO 80401-3396, (303) 231-1545.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Western is one of five power marketingadministrations of the Department of Energy (DOE). It markets and transmitspower in 15 Central and Western States, primarily from Federal hydroelectricpowerplants. The BCA and the SLCA market the power generated from severalhydroelectric powerplants, which are primarily located in the Upper andLower Colorado River Basins. In addition, the BCA markets a portion ofthe generation from the Navajo coal-fired powerplant of the Central ArizonaProject. The power marketing functions of both Areas include transmissionservice as well as power sales. The transmission systems provide interconnectionsbetween Federal powerplants as well as interconnections between variousFederal, public, and investor-owned utility systems. Western markets bothfirm and nonfirm power and transmission service. Western may enter into transactions both through WSPP and through otheragreements. Except for the rates for Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Saleor Exchange Service, which will be applicable to WSPP transactions only,the rates will be used by Western for both WSPP and non-WSPP transactions,as appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economy Energy Service </ITAG>Western sells short-term surplus energy, called Fuel Replacement Energy,to entities that reduce power production from fossil-fueled powerplantsto conserve fuel. Selling surplus energy at 85 percent of a powerplant'sfuel cost provided a basis for pricing and could be adhered to when a specificpowerplant could easily be identified and the price of the energy directlyrelated to the fuel saved. However, present-day situations in the utilityindustry have changed from when the sale of Fuel Replacement Energy wasinitiated more than 20 years ago. Today, major utilities have numerousplants in daily operation that have a wide range of operating costs. Becauseof multiple-unit operations, utilities often reduce power generation ofmore than one unit when buying energy from another utility. A utility'shighest cost unit is not always the one reduced in power level becauseof such considerations as take or pay coal contracts or transmission constraints.Minimum power levels of large plants also affect which units may be backeddown. Economic dispatch has evolved among utilities in order to improve the economicutilization of both generation and transmission facilities. Because ofthis, and other considerations, pricing of short-term surplus energy transactionsamong power suppliers is driven by factors other than fuel savings at aparticular plant. It is increasingly more difficult, and less significant,for Western to base short-term surplus energy prices on fuel savings associatedwith a specific generating unit. Some short-term surplus energy sales, previously conducted as Fuel ReplacementEnergy sales, can be more appropriately conducted under the proposed categoryof Economy Energy Service. Quantifiable conservation of fuel will stillbe accomplished but the energy prices will directly reflect all factors,which establish short-term energy prices among thermal suppliers. The Economy Energy Service rate is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The rate for Economy Energy Service is based upon the pricing fornonfirm energy sales among the power suppliers within the interconnectedsystems.</ITAG>Economy Energy Service is set forth in Rate Schedules BCAP-EEI and SLIP-EEIfor the BCA projects and the SLCA/IP respectively. For marketing and operational flexibility, Western may also continue tosell surplus energy as Fuel Replacement Energy, and the methodology fordetermining the Fuel Replacement Energy rate will be maintained. <ITAG tagnum="84">Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service </ITAG>From time to time, the BCA and the SLCA have firm power available for coordinationtransactions; i.e., firm power that is available over and above the normalmarketing obligations, including seasonal offers made by the SLCA/IP. Suchpower, committable for less than 1 year, may be peaking only or peakingwith energy. The energy may or may not be marketed on an exchange basis.The rate for this service would be an alternative to using one or moreof the components of the then current firm power rates. The Short-TermFirm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service rate will provide Westernwith increased marketing flexibility. The rate for Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service willbe utilized for WSPP commitments of less than 1 year and will be as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The rate for Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Serviceis based upon the pricing for firm capacity and energy sales among theparticipants of the Western Systems Power Pool.</ITAG>The rate for Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service isnot set forth in a rate schedule. Western will offer this service onlyunder the WSPP agreement that includes the above rate schedule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Nonfirm Transmission Service </ITAG>The BCA and the SLCA provide Nonfirm Transmission Service on an as-availablebasis. Any revenues generated from Nonfirm Transmission Service help offsetthe need for future power and transmission rate increases. If a fixed nonfirm wheeling rate is too high, it may not encourage theefficient use of Western's future available transmission system capacity.If the rate is too low, it may not result in fair compensation to Western.A flexible Nonfirm Transmission Service rate is a way to encourage themost efficient and economical use of Western's transmission systems. For the BCA projects, the Nonfirm Transmission Service rate, as providedfor by Rate Schedule BCAP-NFT1, is an alternative to the current NonfirmTransmission Service rate of 1.4 mills per kilowatthour (kWh) providedby Rate Schedule PD-NFT2, Parker-Davis Project, Schedule of Rates for NonfirmTransmission Service. The new rate will also be an alternative to establishedcharges for the Central Arizona Project and the Pacific Northwest-PacificSouthwest Intertie (Southern Division, alternating current) system NonfirmTransmission Service. In the SLCA, transmission is only provided through the Colorado River StorageProject (CRSP), not the SLCA/IP. Therefore in the SLCA the CRSP NonfirmTransmission Service rate will be Rate Schedule SP-NFT3, CRSP, Scheduleof Rates for Nonfirm Transmission Service, and will replace Rate ScheduleSP-NFT2. For both the BCA projects and the SLCA CRSP, the Nonfirm Transmission Servicerate can be used to provide additional transmission services not presentlyprovided, such as firm standby service as defined by the WSPP agreement.Western will use the proposed Nonfirm Transmission Service rate for allwheeling transactions under the WSPP, provided the transaction is for lessthan 1 year. The rate for Nonfirm Transmission Service is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The rates for Nonfirm Transmission Service are based upon the pricingfor Nonfirm Transmission Service within the interconnected system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Issues_Public Comments </ITAG>During the 30-day comment period, Western received three comment letters,one of which requested additional information that has been provided. Western'sresponses to the comments are as stated below: A. One commenter expressed concern that Western may plan to limit the typeof transmission service it will offer under WSPP and noted that no utilityhas been admitted to the WSPP under a request for special conditions thatwould limit use of the agreement. The commenter is also concerned thatWSPP will increase competition for use of Western's transmission systemand threaten priority of use of the transmission system occurring underan existing contract. Response 1. Western intends to participate fully in WSPP, to the extent that servicesoffered are for discretionary or coordination sales that are short-termcommitments of 1 year or less. Coordination sales represent short-termfirm or nonfirm power that is available over and above normal marketingobligations (54 FR 14859). Specifically, Western will offer, as systemavailability allows, nonfirm and firm standby transmission service as identifiedin the WSPP agreement, as long as the commitment is for less than 1 year.Western does not feel that it is requesting special conditions of the WSPPagreement by not offering firm transmission service. The WSPP agreementcarries no obligation to buy or sell. Section D-3.1 of the WSPP agreementprovides that each party shall be the sole judge as to the extent and conditionsunder which it is willing to provide services. The intent of WSPP is toprovide for supplementary market-based transactions under real-time marketconditions. 2. The WSPP agreement does not replace or supersede existing commitments.Capacity, energy, and transmission services offered through WSPP will onlybe discretionary sales that are over and above normal marketing obligations,including existing contracts. B. One entity requested an explanation of how Western customers, who donot have generation/load dispatching capabilities, could make use of theproposed rates and services. Response Western, in a letter to the entity, indicated that these rates are intendedprimarily to be used for transactions between Western and other WSPP membersor other utilities with generation/load dispatching capabilities. Benefitsof WSPP membership, including extra revenues from either Economy EnergyService sales or Fuel Replacement Energy sales, having greater access tomarket information, keeping expenses down through better system utilization(particularly transmission facilities), lower purchase costs, and betterprices for short-term discretionary sales, help hold down the rate requiredfor firm power service and firm transmission service. These benefits arepassed on to all Western customers through these lower rates. C. One customer expressed the following concerns that the proposed transmissionrates might adversely impact its costs for purchases of excess Federalpower: 1. Any rate increase for transmission might be made applicable to short-termarrangements for the purchase of excess CRSP power during the summer season.Such a transmission rate applicable to that excess capacity would do seriouseconomic damage and make those resources more expensive than alternateresources that were otherwise available when these contracts were agreedupon.2. Any excess resources available from Hoover, Parker, or Davis Dams mightnot be economical if short-term transmission arrangements on the Parker-DavisProject system are at this new rate. 3. Fuel Replacement Energy and other short-term resources, otherwise availableto preference entities, might not be available under the new rates. Response The proposed Nonfirm Transmission Service rates will not affect short-termpurchases of SLCA/IP capacity and energy because such sales include transmissionto CRSP designated points of delivery. 2. With the exception of the CRSP Nonfirm Transmission Service, the rateswill not supersede rates provided for under existing contracts. The BoulderCanyon Project customers have firm transmission contracts with Westernfor delivery of all of the Boulder Canyon Project energy and capacity,including entitlements to Schedule C energy. Since the Federal transmissionsystems in the BCA are heavily subscribed, the delivery of excess BoulderCanyon Project or Parker-Davis Project capacity, if and when available,will depend on the availability of transmission capacity at that time.Availability of transmission capacity to deliver excess capacity from suchprojects will be affected more by transmission system use by customerswith firm delivery rights than it will by the rate structure for NonfirmTransmission Service. 3. When available, any seasonal excess SLCA/IP capacity will continue tobe offered first to preference customers under existing firm rates. Afterthe preference customers are satisfied, any additional SLCA/IP capacitynot committed to preference entities will be sold on the open market eitheras Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service or as EconomyEnergy Service at the proposed rates. Long-term firm marketing and salesof seasonal firm SLCA/IP capacity and associated energy will not changewith the adoption of these rates. Fuel Replacement Energy will continue to be offered to Western's customerswith Fuel Replacement contracts. Most of Western's Fuel Replacement sales(87 percent in fiscal year 1988) are to customers who are already membersof the WSPP, so it is unlikely that the proposed Economy Energy Servicerate or Western's membership in WSPP will significantly affect the availabilityof Fuel Replacement Energy or other short-term energy resources. <ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Authorization </ITAG>Power rates for Western are established pursuant to the DOE OrganizationAct of August 4, 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7101, <T3>et seq.</T3>); the  Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C. 372, <T3>et seq.</T3>), as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments,particularly section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C.485h(c)); and the acts specifically applicable to the project system involved.Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effective May 30, 1986 (51 FR 19744, May30, 1986), as amended, delegated to the Administrator of Western the authorityto develop and place in effect, on a final basis, power and transmissionrates for short-term sales; i.e., sales of no more than 1-year duration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Compliance </ITAG>Section D of the DOE guidelines for compliance with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) (52 FR 47662) address short-term sales. Under sectionD of these guidelines, the execution of contracts, marketing plans, orallocation plans for the short-term or seasonal allocations (less than1 year) of existing or excess power resource to customers who can receivethese resources over existing transmission systems are categorically excludedfrom NEPA analysis. Therefore, an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement will not be prepared for this action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Act) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601,<T3>et seq.</T3>), each agency, when required by 5 U.S.C. 553 to publisha proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available forpublic comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe theimpact of the proposed rule on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 601(2), ratesor services of particular applicability are not considered rules withinthe meaning of the Act. Because the rate is for services provided by Westernfrom particular projects, no flexibility analysis is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determination Under Executive Order 12991 </ITAG>The DOE has determined that this is not a major rule because it does notmeet the criteria of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193,February 17, 1981). In addition, Western has an exemption from sections3, 4, and 7 of Executive Order 12291, and therefore will not prepare aregulatory impact statement. Order In view of the foregoing, and pursuant to the authority delegated to meby the Secretary of Energy in Delegation Order No. 0204-108, dated December14, 1983, as amended, I hereby approve and place into effect on a finalbasis, effective at the beginning of the August 1989 billing period, anew rate for Economy Energy Service (Rate Schedules BCAP-EE1 and SLIP-EE1),Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service, and Nonfirm TransmissionService (Rate Schedules BCAP-NFT1 and SP-NFT3) for the BCA projects andthe SLCA/IP.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Golden, Colorado, July 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William H.
