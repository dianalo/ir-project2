Zhivkov was reacting to growing unrest among ethnic Turks, whohave violently resisted an assimilation campaign in Bulgaria. Sincethe campaign began in 1984, 100 ethnic Turks have died in clasheswith Bulgarian security forces and thousands have been imprisoned.   Ozal said Bulgaria had rejected previous suggestions that thecountries negotiate an immigration agreement, most recently in1988. He said he believed the announcement from Sophia might betimed to influence discussion of the issue at a 35-nation Helsinkihuman rights conference that opened Tuesday in Paris.   ``If they have now changed their minds, I propose we immediatelysit at a table and work out an immigration agreement of extensivescope,'' said Ozal.   But he said any agreement must protect the rights of ethnicTurks.   ``They are sending our ethnic brothers out with only onesuitcase. What happened to their lands, their other goods?'' Ozalsaid.   Although Turkish officials have said they are ready to acceptthe entire minority population in Bulgaria if necessary, privatelythey are worried about the influx of such a large group without anypossessions, funds or jobs.   Bulgaria took the offensive at the Paris conference by blamingTurkey for recent violence involving Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.   The conference is to review human rights progress amongsignatories of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.   It also is expected to single out nations accused of specificabuses, and Romania and Bulgaria are expected to take the brunt ofcriticism.   In an early speech, Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov of Bulgariaaccused ``foreign circles'' of being behind recent disturbances inhis country in which ethnic Turks reportedly have been killed.   The ethnic Turkish minority in Bulgaria is estimated at 900,000.But Ozal said he believes the figure is as high as 2.5 million.   Unrest among ethnic Turks has grown recently. Last week, theBulgarian news agency said security forces killed three ethnicTurks protesting the assimilation campaign. But deported ethnicTurks said upon arriving in Ankara the death toll was at least 30in the clash.   The Bulgarian government has resorted to mass deportations ofthe minority group to quell mounting resistence to the assimilationcampaign, which changes the Moslem names of ethnic Turks to Slavicones, forbids use of the Turkish language and prohibits Islamicworship.   An estimated 380,000 Turks have been repatriated to Turkey since1925 through defection or programs to reunite split families.</TEXT></DOC>
