The model consisted of 6 m{sup 2} air chamber, 67 cm diameterwells turbine and 1 KW electric generator which is 1/3 of the actualconverter. The experimental wave is an irregular wave. The experimentaims at the optimum design of the system and the prediction of accurateoperation by manufacturing and operating a power generation model similarto the actual unit as far as possible. The power output by the experimentwas a little lower than the value designed, but it was formed, as a whole,that the conventional design method has been reasonable. As an indispensableprotective unit for such a system for the pneumatic chamber and the turbinegenerator, three equipments of air flow adjusting valve, pressure releasevalve, and an emergency valve were trially made and their performancewas tested.
