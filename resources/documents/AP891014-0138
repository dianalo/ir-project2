(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tropical Storm Jerry weakened Saturday asit moved through the Gulf of Mexico toward Louisiana, and after the2,000 residents of the state's only inhabited barrier island wereasked to evacuate.   A hurricane watch had been issued for the coast from the mouthof the Mississippi River west to Port Arthur, Texas, with the stormexpected to cross over land Sunday at the earliest.   The watch was downgraded Saturday to a tropical storm watch. TheNational Weather Service said the storm had weakened and conditionsremained unfavorable for strengthening in the next day or two.   The weather service said New Orleans, which had braced for adirect hit, had received only 1-100th of an inch of rain all day.Forecasters expected the storm to continue moving north but to turntoward the northeast Sunday.   Oil companies continued evacuating the more than 4,000 peoplewho work on offshore rigs, Texas authorities mobilized emergencyworkers and Mississippi officials worried about whether they wouldhave to postpone a special election Tuesday.   In Grand Isle, Mayor Andy Valence said he asked residents toevacuate starting Saturday morning even though the storm's maineffect at the time was good fishing.   ``People who live fairly near Grand Isle have come down to takeadvantage of the great fishing that this disruptive weather bringsabout,'' Valence said.   Traffic appeared normal in both directions on Louisiana Highway1, the only road connecting the island to the mainland, but Valenceestimated that up to 1,000 people had left by Saturday night. Hesaid most of the 150 or so boats moored at Grand Isle left Fridayat his request to avoid tie-ups at the highway drawbridge.   ``With the decreasing of the storm in strength, people here canbe very easily and quickly self-mobilized. So there is no strictsense of emergency at this time,'' Valence said Saturday night.   The National Weather Service reported that Jerry had slowed,with maximum sustained winds down from 70 mph to near 60 mph, andmovement north-northeast at about 7 mph down from 13 mph Fridaynight.   At 9 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was located near 26 degreesnorth latitude and 93 degrees west longitude, or about 335 milessouth-southwest of New Orleans, the weather service said.   ``It's still a fairly strong tropical storm. There's been alittle bit of decrease of convection around the center compared toyesterday, so it doesn't appear any strengthening is likely,'' saidFrank Rivette, a meteorologist with the weather service in NewOrleans.   Coastal flooding was a major concern. Because of the way theEarth, sun and moon are aligned, tides through Friday were expectedto peak at their highest levels in a decade.   ``It could cause some problems in outlying areas of southeasternLouisiana, along the coast outside hurricane protection systems,''said Rivette.   Up to 1,300 offshore oil workers were ferried in Saturday byPetroleum Helicopter Inc. helicopters based in Morgan City, saidPHI communications specialist Wayne Firmin.   ``That's just out of Morgan City, PHI only, today alone. And weworked all day yesterday doing the same thing,'' he said.   PHI, one of several helicopter companies servicing offshore oilrigs, has 13 bases on the Texas and Louisiana coast.   Elsewhere, emergency preparedness officials took a wait-and-seeattitude.   ``We just prepare for the worst and hope for the best. But rightnow we don't anticipate any serious problems,'' said Morgan CityMayor Cedric LaFleur.   ``Our shelters are on standby, and sand and sandbags are onstandby,'' said Ed Comeaux, civil defense director for IberiaParish.   Mississippi Secretary of State Dick Molpus said the stateElection Commission is prepared to meet Monday to decide whether topostpone a special election to fill the late Rep. Larkin Smith'sseat.   In Texas, Galveston city and county workers opened emergencyheadquarters to coordinate possible storm relief. In Austin,officials issued statements warning coastal and nearby residents tobeware of possible flooding from high tides and heavy rains.   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since HurricaneHugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina last month.The storm, which killed 33 in the Caribbean and 29 on the mainlandUnited States, hit Charleston, S.C., late Sept. 21.   Tropical storms are named when maximum sustained winds reach 39mph. Hurricanes are declared when winds hit 74 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
