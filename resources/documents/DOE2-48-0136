<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-0136 </DOCNO><TEXT>A survey is made of the enhanced recovery of oil in the North Sea. Reservoircharacteristics are briefly outlined, and production characteristicsare described. In North Sea terms, enhanced recovery means improvingthe waterflood efficiency, already excellent, or targeting oil trappedin waterflooded regions. Economics of a typical operation mean that enhancedrecovery must take place early enough in field life that conventionalrecovery will pay for the high operating costs of the platform. Totaltechnical potential for enhanced recovery techniques has been estimatedat 3-5% of in-place reserves. The applicable technique will depend onthe oil price: at current price levels, only polymer flooding and somegas applications look attractive. Success or failure of such a techniqueis very dependent on the resources devoted to reservoir evaluation, andif there is enhanced recovery potential it should be considered at thedesign stage. Drilling, well placement, timing, and monitoring are alsoimportant in the enhanced recovery strategy chosen. Evaluations are madeof polymer flooding, surfactant flooding, and gas injection and theireconomic/technical applicability, with gas injection being consideredas having the best opportunities. For heavy oils, conventional enhancedrecovery techniques are extremely difficult in the North Sea environment,and any innovative techniques developed would not be economic at currentoil prices. No specific tax incentives are given for enhanced recoveryprojects in either the UK or Norwegian North Sea; such incentives willbe necessary to encourage such projects, particularly if oil prices remainbelow $20/bbl. 5 refs., 9 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
