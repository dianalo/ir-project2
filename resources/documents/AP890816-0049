REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soldiers stormed a prison and killedconvicts holding a religious group hostage after learning they hadmurdered male captives and raped the women, the officer in charge ofthe jail said today.   All 16 convicts and five of the 15 hostages died before troopsrecaptured the jail Tuesday in Davao City, 610 miles south of Manila.   The dead included a 9-year-old boy and Australian missionaryJacqueline Hamill, 36, of Sydney. One of the captives who was freedsaid Miss Hamill was raped at knifepoint the night before she waskilled.   Officials said most of the hostages were slain by their captorsbefore the assault and that none of the captives died in themilitary attack.   But in Canberra, Australia's foreign minister said Miss Hamillmay have been killed by soldiers when the convicts tried to breakout of the jail hours before troops stormed it.   President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said there was no evidencethe military bungled the hostage crisis but announced aninvestigation into the bloody incident.   Lt. Col. Franco Calida, Davao City's police commander and jailsuperintendent, said civilian officials tried to negotiate with theinmates after they seized the hostages Sunday during religiousservices at the prison.   A few hours before the attack, the convicts had tried to escapeby using hostages as shields. During an exchange of gunfire, onecaptive and one inmate were killed but five hostages escaped. Theytold police of the rapes and killings, Calida told Manila radiostation DZXL.   ``When we learned that the women were raped and that malehostages were being killed, the task was given to us,'' Calida said.``So the negotiating team was left with no other choice, because thehostages were being killed one by one. That is what the hostageswere telling the negotiating team.''   The attack began at about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firingautomatic weapons and secured the downtown jail after about 40minutes, witnesses and officials said.   Miss Hamill's body was found dumped outside the detention centerwith a bullet wound in the chest. She had only been in Davao Cityfor a month.   The Rev. Fred Castillo, one of the freed hostages, said MissHamill and some of the nine other women hostages were raped. Otherfreed hostages said they heard the women screaming on Monday night.   ``Jackie told me about the incident,'' Castillo said Tuesday.   In Canberra, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said it appeared MissHamill may have been shot by a soldier during the escape attempt.   ``In the doctor's opinion, death was instantaneous and hadoccurred some hours previously, which would indicate she had beenshot during the attempted escape incident in the morning.'' Evanssaid in a report to the Australian Senate. ``Ms. Hamill was seen toslump as the group retreated back through a gateway to the innercompound.''   Evans said he had asked Philippine officials to investigate herdeath.   In Hobart, Australia, Miss Hamill's father, Ray Hamill,criticized both Australian and Philippine authorities for theirhandling of the crisis.   ``Why the hell did they have to storm the prison?'' he told thenewspaper Hobart Mercury. ``She gave her life to helping otherpeople and now she has paid for it with her life.''   Presidential spokesman Adolfo Azcuna told reporters, ``Thereappears to be no indication of mishandling the situation although weare examining exactly whether what they reported actually is whatreally happened, whether or not the casualties could have beenavoided and what can be done to avoid similar situations in thefuture.''   All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, aProtestant group. Calida said the group had been holding prisonservices for two years as part of a program ``to rehabilitate theprisoners'' to ``help them morally.''</TEXT></DOC>
