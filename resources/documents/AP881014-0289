Robert E. Lee led one of the bloodiestbattles of the Civil War.   The negotiators, who are seeking compromise on competing Houseand Senate versions of a catchall tax bill, agreed Thursday nightto include a requirement that the land be annexed into ManassasNational Battlefield Park, 30 miles west of Washington.   Leaders of the Senate-House conference committee, hoping to wrapup work on the bill today, also agreed Thursday to provisions:   _Imposing limited economic sanctions against Iraq in protest ofthat nation's use of poison gas against thousands of members of itsKurdish minority.   The sanctions would prohibit export of munitions andhigh-technology equipment to Iraq and require U.S. representativesto oppose lending to Iraq by the World Bank and other internationalorganizations. If the president has evidence at year-end that theuse of chemical weapons is continuing, he would have to imposetougher sanctions that could include a cutoff of import-exportcredit and barring Iraqi imports into the United States.   _Giving freelance writers, photographers and artists relief froma part of the 1986 tax-overhaul law. Under the new provision, theycould deduct certain expenses of producing a book, painting orphotographs before the works started generating income.   _Increasing, to 33.75 cents per mile, the mileage allowancegiven rural mail carriers who drive their own cars on their routes.Most people who use their car in business get only 22.5 cents amile.   _Removing restrictions on the amount of long-term bonds theTreasury Department may issue at interest rates above 4.25 percent.   Agreements on the provisions were reached by Rep. DanRostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and MeansCommittee; Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Financerevenue subcommittee; and the senior Republicans on the twocommittees, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.   The agreements are subject to approval by a majority of theother negotiators, but aides said they expect no problem.   The chief purpose of the differing bills is to fix hundreds oferrors and ambiguities in the new tax law enacted in 1986. Themeasures have been expanded to carry scores of relatively minor taxbenefits and the tax increases necessary to pay for them. TheSenate version also includes a ``bill of rights'' to help taxpayerswho face enforcement or collections actions by the Internal RevenueService.   ``We made a lot of progress. We are doing very well,'' Baucussaid at the end of Thursday's negotiations.   Added Rostenkowski: ``We've got $7 billion'' worth of taxbenefits in the House bill and ``the Senate's got $3 billion. It(the final version) will be some place in the middle.''   The provision requiring the taking of a portion of the sitewhere the Second Battle of Manassas was fought in August 1862 wasadded to the tax bill only because sponsors saw no other way ofgetting it enacted into law this year. The courts would decide howmuch owners of the land are paid; the Reagan administration, whichopposes the plan, estimates the cost at $50 million.   Historians say that is a small price to pay, but theadministration insists the same point could be made by taking only80 acres at considerably less cost. Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,offered the 80-acre provision to the Senate but lost when Sen. DaleBumpers, D-Ark., on a 50-25 vote, won approval to take the full 540acres.   Warner's amendment would have allowed construction of houses andsome commercial development on the remainder of the plot; only amall would have been prohibited.   Sixteen thousand troops were killed or wounded during a 48-hourfight on the site.</TEXT></DOC>
