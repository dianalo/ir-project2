Background</ITAG>A. HistoryOn August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-53 (43 FR 37672,54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR Part 4. These regulations allow theestablishment of definite viticultural areas. The regulations also allowthe name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an appellationof origin on wine labels and in wine advertisements.On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-60 (44 FR 56692)which added a new Part 9 to 27 CFR, providing for the listing of approvedAmerican viticultural areas, the names of which may be used as appellationsof origin.B. Regulatory CriteriaSection 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27, CFR, defines an American viticultural areaas a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features,the boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of Part 9. Section4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticulturalarea. The petition should include_(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locallyand/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition;(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticulturalarea are as specified in the petition;(c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics (climate, soil,elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticulturalfeatures of the proposed area from surrounding areas:(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area,based on features which can be found on United States Geological Survey(U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and(e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the boundaries prominentlymarked.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Description_Final Rule</ITAG>The Stags Leap District viticultural area is located east of the city ofYountville and approximately seven miles north of the city of Napa. Itis bounded on the north by the Yountville Cross Road, on the east by theStags Leap mountain range (400 foot contour line), on the south by a drainagecreek that intersects the Silverado Trail at about the 60 foot contourline, and on the west by the Napa River. This viticultural area consistsof approximately 2,700 acres, includes nine bonded wineries and approximately1,350 acres of grapes, and is entirely within the Napa Valley viticulturalarea.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Rulemaking Proceeding</ITAG>A. PetitionOn August 22, 1985, the Stags Leap Appellation Committee (hereinafter referredto as Group A), petitioned ATF for establishment of a viticultural areain Napa Valley, California, to be known as ``Stags Leap.'' The area proposedby the petitioners consisted of approximately 2,200 acres (including approximately1,100 acres of vineyards), situated east of the city of Yountville, andfive to eight miles north of the City of Napa. The proposed area was surroundedby hills to the north, east, and west, and was configured like a funnel.Group A then submitted an amendment to its petition, dated December 18,1985 (hereinafter referred to as the First Amendment) and requested, amongother things, that the name of the proposed viticultural area be changedfrom ``Stags Leap'' to ``Stags Leap District.'' This was done in orderto underscore further the difference between the viticultural area designationand the names of two wineries within the proposed appellation, Stag's LeapWine Cellars and Stags' Leap Winery.On June 26, 1986, Group A submitted a second amendment and supplement toits original petition (hereinafter referred to as the Second Amendment).The Second Amendment requested a revision of the northern and western boundariesof the proposed Stags Leap District. Attached to the Second Amendment wasa research document prepared by Silverado Vineyards, in support of GroupA's contention that the Napa River, rather than the peaks of the hillswest of the Silverado Trail, was the appropriate western boundary for theproposed viticultural area, and the ring of hills to the north was a moreappropriate northern boundary. The revision of the northern and westernboundaries added approximately 350 acres to the proposed viticultural area,for a total size of approximately 2,550 acres. Included within the extendedboundaries were previously excluded vineyards owned by, among others, SilveradoVineyards and Mondavi Winery.B. NoticeIn response to the Second Amendment, ATF published Notice No. 620 in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 11, 1987 (52 FR 4350), proposingestablishment of the Stags Leap District viticultural area. The noticedetailed the boundaries as proposed in the Second Amendment, and requestedcomments. Written comments were to be received on or before April 13, 1987.C. CommentsATF received two comments in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking.One comment in particular, dated April 10, 1987, was submitted by Mr. StanleyAnderson of S. Anderson Vineyard. Mr. Anderson, who owns a winery and vineyardslocated just north of the proposed northern boundary, requested that thenorthern boundary be extended approximately 500 yards. He suggested thatthe Yountville Cross Road would be a more appropriate boundary than thepeaks of hills as proposed in Notice No. 620. The proposed revision wouldadd 150 acres to the proposed Stags Leap District, for a total size ofapproximately 2,700 acres. With the exception of the northern boundary,Mr. Anderson supported the other boundaries as proposed in the notice.Attached to Mr. Anderson's comment were letters from several neighboringvineyard owners who are also located in the proposed ``northern extension,''all of whom supported the extension of the northern boundary to the YountvilleCross Road. Mr. Anderson, and those of his neighbors who supported thenorthern extension, will hereinafter be referred to as Group B.D. HearingIn consideration of the comments received, ATF determined that the publicinterest would best be served by holding a public hearing on the matter.Pursuant to Notice No. 644, published on September 29, 1987 (52 FR 36431),ATF held a hearing on December 1 and 2, 1987, in Yountville, California,concerning establishment of the viticultural area. ATF heard oral commentsfrom 32 persons. At the hearing, Mr. George Altamura (Altamura Vineyardsandamp; Winery), requested that the southern boundary of the proposed viticulturalarea be extended (approximately 2 miles) in order to include his vineyardand winery.As specified in Notice No. 644, written comments were to be received onor before December 15, 1987. This date was then extended until January15, 1988 (Notice No. 647, 52 FR 44917; November 23, 1987). In responseto Notice Nos. 644 and 647, the Bureau received 167 comments, representing172 signatures. ATF also received nine comments after the expiration ofthe comment period. All comments were given careful consideration in thepreparation of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Decision</ITAG>After extensive consideration of the evidence and comments presented regardingestablishment of a Stags Leap District viticultural area, ATF finds thatthe evidence submitted with respect to the boundaries proposed by GroupB satisfies the regulatory criteria set forth in andSection; 4.25a(e)(2)of Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations, for the establishment of theStags Leap District viticultural area.Although recognizing that there is evidence which would support both GroupA and Group B in this matter, ATF finds that the greater weight of evidencesupports the Group B proposal. ATF finds that the general area encompassedwithin the boundaries proposed by Group B is locally referred to as StagsLeap District. In the Bureau's view, Group B adequately demonstrated thattheir proposed area reflects the current definition of Stags Leap District.Further, ATF finds that the distinguishing features in the area proposedby Group A are also present in the northern extension proposed by GroupB. Specifically, the soils in the northern extension are more similar tothe soils within the area originally proposed than to the soils outsidethe proposed Stags Leap District. ATF believes that the soils (includingsubsoils) are the primary distinguishing geographical feature of the StagsLeap District.In contrast, ATF finds that the evidence submitted in support of the proposedextension of the southern boundary did not satisfy the regulatory criteria.Specifically, there was no evidence that the area within the proposed southernextension is locally or nationally known as ``Stags Leap (District).''The boundaries of the viticultural area established by this final rulegenerally correspond to the area initially proposed by Group B, with modificationsto avoid dividing existing vineyards. The specific boundaries of the viticulturalarea may be found at andSection; 9.117.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Evidence</ITAG>The following summarizes the evidence on which this final rule is based.As applicable, the petition, amendments, comments, and public hearing transcriptsand exhibits are cross-referenced. This is indicated by parenthetical notationssuch as (Petition, p. * * * ), (Tr. Vol. * * *, p. * * * ), (Hearing Exhibit* * * ), etc. In addition, to distinguish between comments received inresponse to the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and comments receivedin response to the hearing notices, comments will be referred to as either(NPRM Comment  * * * ) or (hearing Comment * * *).A. NameBoth Group A and Group B submitted evidence which clearly established thatthere exists an area in Napa County, California, east of Yountville, witha viticultural history, known both historically and currently as StagsLeap District. (Petition, pp. 2-17; NPRM Comment 1). The only dispute regardingthe name Stags Leap District concerns the specific boundaries of the viticulturalarea known by that name. Accordingly, ATF finds, based on the evidence,that both Group A and Group B satisfied the criteria of 27 CFR 4.25a(e)(2)(i)concerning the name of the viticultural area.B. BoundariesGroup A submitted evidence that historically, the name Stags Leap was usedsolely in reference to Horace and Minnie Chase's summer manor house (StagsLeap Manor) constructed in 1890, their winery built in 1893, and the rockypromontory overlooking the area. (Petition, pp. 2-7, p. 25). For example,the petitioners submitted a copy of a wine label from the Chase wineryindicating the name ``Stags' Leap.'' (Petition, Exhibit 4). They also statedthat ``when old timers talk about the boundaries of Stags Leap District,they are more likely to be referring to the old Chase place and its immediatevicinity than they are to the broader viticultural area, which did notbegin to be called Stags Leap until some time in the 1970s.'' (Second Amendment,p. 12).Since the early 1970's, Mr. Carl Doumani (Stags' Leap Winery) and Mr. WarrenWiniarski (Stag's Leap Wine Cellars) have included various brand and tradenames on their wine labels which incorporate the geographic designationStags Leap. (Petition, pp. 11-12; Petition, Exhibit 10).In a 1973 court decision involving litigation over the use of the nameStags Leap, the judge ruled that ``to a person of ordinary intelligence* * * `STAG'S LEAP' is a designation for a substantial area or a rangeof mountains or hills.'' (Petition, p. 10). Thereafter, in the 1974 promotionalmaterial for his winery, Mr. Winiarski noted that ``Stag's Leap is a regionaldesignation which should in time become as familiar to wine buyers as certaindomaines in European wine-growing regions.'' (Petition, pp. 15-16; Petition,Exhibit 10). The name Stags Leap gained further prominence when, in 1976,Mr. Winiarski's 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon took first place at a blind tastingin Paris, France. (Petition, p. 14).While there was general agreement about the history of Stags Leap, theissues of contention during this rulemaking proceeding have centered aroundthe northern boundary in particular and, to a lesser degree, the southernand western boundaries.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Southern Boundary</ITAG>At the public hearing, Mr. George Altamura (Altamura Vineyards andamp; Winery)commented that the area in which his vineyards and winery are located sharesmany of the same geographical features found within the proposed StagsLeap District, including soil series, vegetation, and air-flow pattern.Because of this, Mr. Altamura proposed that the southern boundary of theviticultural area be extended, approximately two miles, to a point whereSoda Creek flows into the Napa River. (Tr. Vol. III, pp. 139-145). Mr.Altamura submitted evidence indicating that certain soils in the proposedsouthern extension (e.g., Haire series) were also found in the proposedStags Leap District. (Hearing Exhibit 39; Hearing Comment 81).In a post-hearing written comment (Hearing Comment 48), Mr. Ernie Weirof Hagafen Cellars stated that if the southern boundary was to be extendedto include Mr. Altamura, he would also like his vineyards and winery tobe included, however, ``perhaps a more appropriate and correct southernborder will not include either of us.''Neither Mr. Altamura nor Mr. Weir submitted evidence which would indicatethat the name ``Stags Leap'' was locally or nationally known as referringto the proposed southern extension.As previously mentioned, the regulations in 27 CFR 4.25a(e)(2) outlinethe procedure for proposing an American viticultural area. In particular,andSection;andSection; 4.25a(e)(2) (i) and (ii) specify that evidence mustbe submitted indicating that the name of the viticultural area is locallyand/or nationally known as referring to the area in the petition, and thatthe boundaries of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition.Based on the information in the rulemaking record, there is no evidenceas to name, either historical or current, to support an extension of thesouthern boundary from that proposed in Notice No. 620. Therefore, ATFis not extending the southern boundary as proposed by Mr. Altamura.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Northern Boundary</ITAG>Conflicting evidence as to the northern boundary was submitted in the petition,comments, and public hearing testimony. In its initial petition, GroupA noted that there had been lively disagreement among the wine press overthe boundaries of Stags Leap District. (Petition, p. 32). Group A and GroupB both presented letters and declarations from long-time residents of thearea, which presented conflicting recollections of the boundaries of theStags Leap District. (Petition, Declarations B and C; NPRM Comment 1, ExhibitsJ-1 and P-1; Hearing Exhibit 2; Hearing Exhibit 28). Based on the evidencepresented, ATF finds that while there are differences in the recollectionsof local residents as to the boundaries of the Stags Leap District, thereis evidence to support the conclusion that the northern extension is knownlocally as part of Stags Leap District.Mr. William F. Heintz, a wine historian, testified on behalf of Group Aat the public hearing. Mr. Heintz stated that in the 1880s, the Napa WineGrowers Association created a series of sub-districts within the southernpart of Napa Valley, for the purpose of gathering data. Mr. Heintz extrapolatedfrom the available data that the boundaries of one of these sub-districtsclosely corresponded to the boundaries of the Stags Leap District, as proposedin Notice No. 620. (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 62-64). This evidence was disputedby Charles Sullivan, another wine historian, who contended that the evidencefrom the 19th century was too incomplete to draw any conclusions as toboundaries. Mr. Sullivan stated that for purposes of determining the validityof the appellation, only the history since the 1960s was relevant. (HearingComment 103). ATF finds that the evidence about the 19th century boundariesof the Napa Wine Growers Association sub-districts was inconclusive; therefore,this evidence was not considered to be significant for purposes of determiningthe current boundaries of the Stags Leap District.Group A also presented evidence to the effect that the vineyard ownersin the northern extension referred to themselves as being located in ``Yountville''rather than ``Stags Leap.'' (Hearing Comment 84, p. 8; Hearing Exhibit10). Group A pointed to the fact that none of the grapes grown in the northernextension were used in wines that were labeled as ``Stags Leap.'' (HearingComment 84, p. 9). They also pointed to the fact that one of the vineyardowners in the proposed extension, Mr. Jack Abruzzini, called his vineyard``J. Abruzzini's Yountville Vineyard,'' and considered himself as beingwithin the Yountville area, rather than the ``Stags Leap District.'' (NPRMComment 2; Hearing Comment 29).Group B presented evidence that the terms Yountville and Stags Leap Districtwere not mutually exclusive, and stated that residents within the proposedStags Leap Dsitrict and the proposed northern extension had ties to thecities of Napa and Yountville. Mrs. Dorothy Barboza, a vineyard owner inthe northern extension, submitted evidence that various vineyards and winerieslocated within the boundaries of the proposed Stags Leap District werelisted in the telephone book as being in Yountville and Napa. (Tr. Vol.III, p. 58; Hearing Exhibit 33). Mrs. Barboza also submitted evidence thatthree of the wineries in the proposed Stags Leap District were membersof the Yountville Chamber of Commerce. (Hearing Exhibit 35). In addition,Mrs. Barboza submitted labels for one winery in the proposed Stags LeapDistrict indicating Yountville as its location. (Hearing Exhibit 30).Group B argued that there was no uniformity in self-description in theStags Leap District; thus, there was no contradiction between using a Yountvilleaddress and being within the Stags Leap District viticultural area. ATFfinds that the various wineries and vineyards within both the proposedStags Leap District and the so-called ``northern extension'' used variousnames in geographical self-description, including Yountville and Napa.Thus, the Bureau does not find that this criteria is a useful means ofdistinguishing vineyards and wineries within the appellation from thoseoutside the appellation.Both Group A and Group B submitted various articles from the wine pressand the general press to support the respective boundaries proposed. Mostof the articles submitted did not articulate specific boundaries for theStags Leap District, but merely referred to the fact that various wineriesor vineyards were located within the boundaries of Stags Leap. Of the articleswhich did mention specific boundaries, there was no uniformity.For example, one article implied that the Stags Leap District area extendedas far west as the Napa River (Petition, Exhibit 13, <T3>Trumpetvine Wines,</T3> April 1985, ``Stags Leap Saga, Part II''),while others implied that the Silverado Trail (Petition, Exhibit 13, <T3>Connoisseur's Guide to California Wine,</T3> Jan-Feb 1977), or perhapsan area to the west thereof (Hearing Exhibit 12, the Napa Register (4/17/81),``Napa Wines Take Tasting Honors'') were the boundary. In one article,a vineyard/winery owner described the Stags Leap District as consistingof only 450 acres (Petition, Exhibit 13, <T3>The Wine Spectator,</T3> January 1-31, 1985, ``Standing Fast for Cabernet''),while in another article, it was described as consisting of 1,000 acres.(Petition, Exhibit 13, <T3>Friends of Wine,</T3> April-May 1984, ``Napa Winery Profiles: The QuestFor Site'').Some of the evidence submitted was susceptible of more than one interpretation.For example, in support of the extended northern boundary, Group B submittedas evidence a map prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)Soil Conservation Service (SCS) which included a sub-district known as``South East Yountville Stag's Leap Area.'' (NPRM Comment 1, pp. 6-7).The sub-district had as its northern boundary the Yountville Cross Road,and as its western boundary the Napa River. Although the southern boundaryextended almost all the way to the city of Napa, it did <T3>not</T3> include the vineyards owned by Mr. Altamura or Mr. Weir.Group A countered with the claim that the map supported its assertion thathe so-called northern extension was a part of Yountville. (Hearing Comment84, p. 7). ATF contacted the SCS, and was informed by letter dated May16, 1988, that the boundaries were drawn based on the property lines of``cooperators,'' i.e., ranches and farms being assisted by the SCS. (RequestedInformation 5). The map was for internal filing purposes only, and wasnot distributed to the public. In addition, the map submitted by GroupB was a replacement for one originally drawn up during the 1950s, but whichhad been lost sometime before 1983. Consequently, as pointed out by theSCS, ``* * * it is highly unlikely that the current map matches the original.''Therefore, ATF has concluded that the map is not of great evidentiary weight,and that it does not support conclusively either Group A or Group B.Both Group A and Group B have pointed for support to an article that appearedin the September 1981 issue of <T3>Vintage Magazine,</T3> entitled ``How Many Stags in a Stag's Leap?''(Petition, Exhibit 13). In describing the Stags Leap District, the authorof the article, Richard Paul Hinkle, defined its bounds ``[f]or the immediatesake of argument, * * * as being Clos du Val on the south, the SilveradoTrail on the west, an extension of the Yountville Cross Road on the north(just south of Rector Reservoir), and the rocky promontories of the easternflank of the Mayacamus Mountains (also called Stags Leap) to the east.''Group B uses this article in support of its contention that the northernboundary goes as far north as the Yountville Cross Road. (NPRM Comment1, p. 4, 8). Group A points to the fact that the boundaries as articulatedby Mr. Hinkle would eliminate all vineyards located west of the SilveradoTrail (Hearing Comment 84, p. 6) including, among others, the vineyardsof S. Anderson Vineyard, Pine Ridge Winery, Silverado Vineyards, and MondaviWinery. However, Mr. Hinkle's article does go on to say that ``[a] significantchunk of acreage may be disputed when the western boundaries come up fordiscussion. Involved are the Disney (Silverado) vineyards * * *, Pine Ridge'svines * * *, and Mondavi's * * *.''ATF finds that neither the Hinkle article, nor any other article submittedin the rulemaking record, specifically lists boundaries identical to eitherproposal. In addition, none of the articles submitted provides a comprehensive,all-inclusive list of wineries and vineyards included in the area whichwould correspond to the boundaries proposed by Group A or Group B.Most of the articles submitted were not intended to present definitivelists of the wineries and vineyards within the Stags Leap District. Therefore,ATF does not find that the fact that some vineyards or wineries were notmentioned is evidence that those vineyards or wineries are not within theStags Leap District. Some of the smaller vineyards located in the centerof the proposed Stags Leap District were not mentioned in any of the articlessubmitted. Instead, ATF has found the press articles useful in settingthe parameters of the boundaries of the Stags Leap District.With reference to the disputed northern boundary, it should be noted thatGroup A did not submit any articles which specifically placed the northernboundary at the hills, as proposed in Notice No. 620. However, Group Bsubmitted one article which specifically included S. Anderson Vineyardon a map of the ``Stag's Leap Area.'' (NPRM Comment 1, Exhibit E). In addition,Group B submitted a copy of a 1983 itinerary for a wine touring business,Wine Adventures, Inc., which refers to S. Anderson Vineyard as being locatedin the Stag's Leap region. (Hearing Comment 47; Requested Information 2).Thus, ATF finds that the weight of the evidence supported the northernaddition proposed by Group B.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Western Boundary</ITAG>With reference to the western boundary, although there was no dispute tothe boundary among the participants at the hearing, ATF did receive conflictingevidence as to its correct location. Specifically, while Group A amendedits petition to move the western boundary from the hills west of the SilveradoTrail to the Napa River, articles were submitted which indicated that thewestern boundary was somewhere east of the Napa River. (Hearing Exhibit12; Petition, Exhibit 13). This conflict was noted in the Hinkle articlepreviously mentioned. However, Group A presented evidence which indicatedthat the Napa River was the western boundary of the Stags Leap Districtarea. (Petition, Exhibit 13). In addition, Group A submitted articles whichspecifically included Silverado Vineyards and Mondavi Winery vineyardsas part of the Stags Leap area. (Second Amendment, pp. 3-4; Petition, Exhibit13). ATF finds that the weight of the evidence supports the placement ofthe western boundary at the Napa River, as proposed in Notice No. 620.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Examples of Evidence Utilized in Support of Decision</ITAG>ATF has utilized over 40 pieces of information which, taken collectively,support the boundaries as adopted in this Treasury decision.

Referenceis also made to the vineyards of Richard Steltzner as being located inthe Stags Leap area. (Petition, Exhibit 13).(3) In the third edition (revised) of ``The Connoisseurs' Handbook of CaliforniaWines'' by Charles E. Olken, Earl G. Singer and Norman S. Roby (Copy. 1984),Stag's Leap is described as being east of Yountville and including Stag'sLeap Wine Cellars. (Petition, Exhibit 13).(4) Point of sale literature for St. Andrew's Vineyard brand 1981 CabernetSauvignon which indicates that part of the wine was derived from grapesgrown in the ``Stag's Leap area in the Napa Valley.'' The grapes were grownin Richard Steltzner's vineyards. (Petition, Exhibit 11; Requested Information1).(5) A copy of a certificate of label approval (dated 3/15/82) for San FranciscoSymphony brand 1979 Cabernet Sauvignon which indicates ``Stag's Leap District''as the origin of the wine. The label states that the grapes came from thevineyards of Richard Steltzner.(6) A copy of a certificate of label approval (dated 10/30/80) for BerkeleyWine Cellars brand 1978 Cabernet Sauvignon which indicates the ``Stag'sLeap Region of Napa Valley'' as the origin of the wine.

(Petition, Exhibit 11; RequestedInformation 1).(7) A copy of a certificate of label approval (dated 6/1/84) for Bay Cellarsbrand 1982 Clarion red wine. The label indicates that the wine was produced,in part, from grapes grown in the ``Stag's Leap region.'' The grapes camefrom Nathan Fay's vineyards. (Petition, Exhibit 11; Requested Information1).After consideration of all of the evidence presented, ATF has concludedthat there is sufficient evidence to substantiate that the additional areaproposed by Group B has been and is currently considered within the StagsLeap District by the general public. Consequently, ATF finds that the areaencompassed within the boundaries proposed by Group B accurately reflectsthe grape growing region known as Stags Leap District.C. Geographical FeaturesGroup A contends that their proposed area is distinguished from surroundingareas by geographical features. They maintain that the topography, climate,and soils which characterize their proposed area combine to produce uniquegrowing conditions. Moreover, they contend that the additional area encompassedby the Group B proposal is characterized by geographical features whichare more similar to the Napa Valley floor than to their proposed area.On the other hand, Group B maintains that there are no significant differencesin topography or climate between the area proposed in Notice No. 620 andthe northern extension area. Group B presented evidence that the soilsin the northern extension were the same as the soils in the proposed area.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Topography </ITAG>In their initial petition, Group A submitted evidence that the proposedStags Leap (District) viticultural area had a distinct microclimate, resultingfrom the orographic configuration of the area. They contended that thearea, surrounded on three sides by hills or mountains, was configured likea funnel, which accentuated the inflow of cool air from San Pablo Bay,which is located south of the proposed area. (Petition, pp. 38-39). Asstated in the weather report of Irving P. Krick Associates, Inc. (Petition,p. 39):<ITAG tagnum="21">The wide end of the funnel faces south to receive the bay breeze andthe frequent fogs and low clouds which accompany it. These breezes arethen guided into the area by its unique topography, including the mountainsto the east of the Silverado Trail and the series of contiguous hills tothe west of the Trail, which serve as the two sides of the funnel.</ITAG>The Krick report goes on to state that the topography of the area alsocontrols the movement of air out of the area, ``[s]pecifically, the airexits to the mountain elevations to the north or, * * * to the main valleyfloor through the narrow passes at the north of Stags Leap.'' (Petition,p. 39). However, with the subsequent extension of the western boundary from thehills west of the Silverado Trail to the Napa River (Second Amendment),as proposed in Notice No. 620, ATF does not believe that the topographyof the viticultural area is a significant geographical feature in determininga western boundary. As meteorologist Donald Schukraft (Weather Network,Inc.) stated at the public hearing in discussing the extended (western)area, ``[t]here is no funnel effect here. This area is open to the Valley.''(Tr. Vol. I, p. 125). Similarly, ATF does not believe that topography is a significant geographicfeature in determining the northern boundary of the Stags Leap Districtviticultural area. Although the petitioners had noted that the northernring of hills, just south of the Yountville Cross Road, defined part ofthe ``funnel,'' no evidence was submitted in the rulemaking proceedingwhich conclusively demonstrated a difference between the area north andsouth of the hills.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Climate_Temperature </ITAG>In their Second Amendment, Group A included a weather study of the proposedviticultural area (as specified in Notice No. 620), prepared by WeatherNetwork, Inc. Weather data was obtained from thermographs and automaticweather stations located both inside and outside (e.g., approximately \1/2\mile west of) the proposed viticultural area. As noted in the report (SecondAmendment, p. 34):<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the daily maximum and minimum temperatures recorded by the stationsin Stags Leap District were generally several degrees higher than thoserecorded by the weather station to the west of the Napa River and nearthe center of the Valley floor. On some days the differences between thetwo stations were over ten degrees.</ITAG>However, Weather Network, Inc. did not set up a weather station in theproposed northern extension area. Consequently, there is no data availablefrom that area. Moreover, the petitioners had conceded that actual maximumtemperature values were not significantly different from those in nearbyareas. (Petition, p. 40). In the aforementioned Krick report, it was statedthat the funnel effect did not cause degree day values as currently calculatedto vary appreciably between the Stags Leap area and the adjacent Napa Valleyareas, and ``for this reason it would be misleading to use only degree-daysas a criteria for evaluating the microclimate of the various vineyardswithin short distances of Stags Leap.'' (Petition, p. 40). At the public hearing, Mr. Donald Schukraft, a certified consulting meteorologist,commented that the hills along the northern boundary of the proposed StagsLeap area ``provide changes in the wind-flow pattern that consequentlyproduce changes in the temperatures and humidity in the vineyards to thenorth and south of the hills. These changes * * * are not found at theYountville Cross Road.'' (Tr. Vol. I, p. 118). For example, Mr. Schukraftasserted that on a day when the wind-flow is from the south, the air wouldflow around the northern hills (south of the Yountville Cross Road) andexit the area south of the northern hills, resulting in temperatures thatare lower and humidity that is higher than the area north of the hills.However, Mr. Schukraft presented no climatological data to support thoseconclusions. ATF received conflicting reports from vineyard owners both within the proposedarea and within the northern extension as to the effects of the wind ontheir respective grape vines. Mr. Richard Chambers, who owns a vineyard in the northern extension, statedat the public hearing that the area in the northern extension (south ofthe Yountville Cross Road) also receives the breezes from the San PabloBay. (Tr. Vol. III, p. 25). To support this contention, he provided photographsof his vineyard and other vineyards in the northern extension (S. AndersonVineyard and Missimer Vineyard) which depicted grape vines bent over, growingtoward the north, away from the south wind. On the other hand, in the areaaround Yountville (west of the Napa River), Mr. Chambers noted only neutralvine growth. (Hearing Exhibit 27). As to how far north the strong windextended, Mr. Chambers stated that ``it undoubtedly crosses the YountvilleCross Road,'' before dissipating in the area further up State Lane. (Tr.Vol. III, p. 26). However, Group A submitted evidence to the contrary. In their post-hearingbrief (Hearing Comment 84, Exhibit P), Mr. John Stuart of Silverado Vineyardsstated that in Silverado's vineyards in Yountville, cane growth is alsooriented toward the north, with subsequent wind damage. Mr. Robert Egansubmitted a post-hearing comment (Hearing Comment 85) which included photographsof Mr. Chambers' vineyard and Mr. Anderson's vineyard indicating that thewind had little or no effect on the vines or canes in either vineyard.Mr. Egan provided photographs of his own vineyard, located just south ofthe northern hills, and suggested that the vines tended to lean to thenorth as a result of the wind. ATF finds that the evidence presented as to the effect of the wind withinthe proposed viticultural area is too inconclusive to support a findingthat the northern hills provide a significant barrier to the winds fromthe south, with resulting differences in temperature. ATF notes that theevidence presented at the hearing indicated that there was no ``funneleffect'' from the area west of the hills west of the Silverado Trail tothe Napa River. ATF does not believe that the ``funnel effect'' representsa significant geographical feature of the entire viticultural area as proposedby Group A. Therefore, ATF does not believe that climate, with regard totemperature, is a significant distinguishing geographical feature in determiningthe boundaries of the Stags Leap District viticultural area.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Climate_Precipitation/Moisture </ITAG>Based on data presented in the USDA SCS <T3>Soil Survey of Napa County, California</T3> (August 1978), averageannual precipitation within the Stags Leap District is 25 to 30 inches.Similar amounts of rainfall can be expected in the areas west and southof the viticultural area, while average rainfall north and east of theviticultural area increases to between 30 and 35 inches. ATF notes thatthere is no conclusive evidence that the area between the Yountville CrossRoad and the northern hills has different precipitation patterns from theproposed viticultural area. Professor Elliott-Fisk, an expert witness for Group A, concluded that thetypes of plants and density of forests and woodlands on the ridges andhills of the proposed Stags Leap District indicate the entrapment of moist,marine air within the area. She also stated that with the exception ofthe oak-madrone woodland, other types of woodlands found within the proposedStags Leap District, such as the oak forest, madrone forest, and conifer-hardwoodforest, do not continue to the north and south of the proposed district.(Hearing Comment 84, Exhibit M. p. 2). This evidence was disputed by Mrs.Dorothy Barboza, a vineyard owner in the northern extension, who sent photographsof conifer trees in the northern extension. (Post Hearing Comment Period3). The Bureau has determined that there is insufficient evidence on thisissue to support a finding that the types of vegetation in the northernextension differ significantly from the types of vegetation found in theproposed Stags Leap District.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Soil_General </ITAG>Based on the evidence submitted in this rulemaking procedure, ATF has concludedthat the soil (including the subsoil) is the primary geographical featurethat distinguishes Stags Leap District from the surrounding areas. According to the SCS soil survey, there are 31 soil series within NapaCounty. Approximately 45% of these soil series are present within the StagsLeap District, as adopted by this Treasury decision. Certain of these soilseries, such as Millsholm, Perkins, and Kidd, are found within the viticulturalarea but not in the surrounding areas. However, within the Stags Leap Districtarea, the Bale soil series predominates. Bale soils are also found to thenorth of the viticultural area, but not in the surrounding areas to theeast, south, or west. The SCS describes Bale soils as being somewhat poorlydrained on alluvial fans, flood plains, and low terraces. As describedin the soil survey, they are formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite andbasic igneous rock. In the following paragraphs, the Bureau will discussthe reasons why it concluded that the soils of the Stags Leap Districtform the best geographical basis for distinguishing the District from theareas which surround it.<T3>a. Eastern Boundary.</T3> The Stags Leap mountain range is locatedjust east of the Stags Leap District. Consequently, this area consistsmainly of Rock outcrop and, to a lesser degree, the Hambright soil series.The SCS soil survey notes that these types of soils are not used for growingwine grapes, either because they are not suitable or there is no wateravailable for irrigation. (SCS Soil Survey, August 1978, pp. 40-43). <T3>b. Southern Boundary.</T3> The dominant soils south of the viticulturalarea include the Hambright series, the Haire series, the Yolo series, andthe Cole series. These four soil series converge just south of the viticulturalarea and, in effect, ``pinch'' it off. In addition, in its post-hearingcomment, Group A noted that there is a confluence of three drainage systemsjust south of the viticultural area_the Napa River, Dry Creek, and HopperCreek. (Hearing Comment 84, Exhibit U). <T3>c. Western Boundary.</T3> In Group A's initial petition, they submitteda report on soils from viticultural consultant Richard Nagoaka. Mr. Nagoakastated that the dominant soils west of the Napa River include the Yoloseries, the Cole series, and the Clear Lake Series. (Petition, p. 48).Mr. Nagoaka also stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The soils to the east of the (Napa) river (the Stags Leap side) weredeposited by alluvial forces from parent materials from the Vaca Rangeon the eastern rim of the Napa Valley. By contrast, the soils to the westof the Napa River were deposited from parent materials from the MayacamusRange on the western rim of the valley. These two ranges not only appeardifferent, but are composed of profoundly different materials. (Petition,p. 45).</ITAG>According to Mr. Nagoaka, the Vaca mountain range was formed about tenmillion years ago through volcanic activity. In contrast, the Mayacamusmountain range formed about 30 million years ago, and is composed of finesand sedimentary materials. Thus, as Mr. Nagoaka pointed out, soils westof the Napa River ``tend to be deeper, more fertile and of greater water-holdingcapacity'' than those east of the Napa River. (Petition, p. 46). Becauseof the greater water-holding capacity, soils west of the Napa River donot require late irrigation. Mr. Nagoaka compared the water-holding capacityof the Cole silt loam soils (west of the Napa River) with the Bale clayloam soils east of the Napa River. He found that the Bale soils contained0.08-0.11 inches of available water per inch of soil, while the Cole soilscontained 0.16-0.21 inches of water per inch of soil, approximately doublethe water-holding capacity. Mr. Nagoaka concluded that ``[v]iticulturally,the management of vineyards west and east of the river is profoundly influencedby the different soil types and their characteristics.'' (Petition, p.50). <T3>d. Northern Boundary.</T3> The public hearing and subsequent commentsproduced much conflicting evidence as to classification of the soils inthe proposed northern extension. Based upon the following evidence, however,ATF has concluded that the soils in the northern extension are more similarto the soils in the area proposed in Notice NO. 620 than to the area tothe north of the Yountville Cross Road. The following evidence was consideredby ATF: <T3>i. Elliott-Fisk Geography Report.</T3> At the hearing, Professor DeborahElliott-Fisk, an Assistant Professor, Department of Geography, Universityof California, Davis, testified on behalf of Group A. Professor Elliott-Fiskstated, on the basis of soil samples taken in the area north of the YountvilleCross Road, that she believed that the soils south of the Yountville CrossRoad had been incorrectly mapped as Bale clay loam on SCS maps. (Tr. Vol.I, p. 94-95). Professor Elliott-Fisk conceded, however, that she had not taken any soilsamples from the area south of the Yountville Cross Road. In their post-hearingbrief, Group A summarized the findings of Professor Elliott-Fisk, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The vineyard area within (the proposed) Stags Leap District, whichonce served as the channel of the Napa River, contains alluvial sub-soilsderived from volcanic and sedimentary bedrock and from Napa River deposits.These soils have never been covered by fan deposits and are fine, well-weatheredand well-drained. By contrast, the sub-soils of the areas north and southof (the proposed) Stags Leap District are comprised of more recent depositsof the well-defined Rector Canyon Fan and Soda (Canyon) Creek Fan, respectively.(Hearing Comment 84, p. 11).</ITAG>Professor Elliott-Fisk stated that the beginning of the Rector Canyon Fanabutted the northern edge of the hills which were proposed as the northernboundary of Stags Leap District. She stated that the Soda Canyon Fan beganat approximately the southern boundary of the proposed viticultural area.(Tr. Vol. I, p. 98; Hearing Exhibit 6).In support of the above conclusions, Professor Elliott-Fisk stated that(subsequent to the hearing) she had sampled and analyzed soils from bothwithin and outside of the proposed viticultural area. The samples withinthe proposed viticultural area were taken from the Egan property (justsouth of the northern hills), and the Silverado Vineyards property (justinside the proposed western boundary, east of the Napa River). Sampleswere also taken from the Simonson property in the northern extension (justnorth of the proposed northern boundary, and south of the Yountville CrossRoad), and from another Egan property (just north of the Yountville CrossRoad, and west of State Lane), and from two sites just south of the proposedsouthern boundary of Stags Leap District (Shafer Winery's Oak Knoll vineyard).In her report (Hearing Comment 113), Professor Elliott-Fisk noted thather analyses of the above-mentioned samples indicated the following:(a) The soils on the properties of Simonson (located in the northern extension),and Egan (located just north of the Yountville Cross Road), were both formedon the Rector Canyon Fan; however, the Egan soil is ``at the outer marginof the Rector Canyon Fan and the outer margin of the Napa River flood-plain/historicterrace.'' (Hearing Comment 113, p. 6).(b) The soil on the Egan property within the proposed Stags Leap Districtis on the old (former) Napa River channel; (c) The Silverado Vineyards property shares soil similarities with themore central portion of the proposed Stags Leap District, and; (d) The soils on the Shafer property, just south of the proposed viticulturalarea, are on the Soda Canyon Fan.Group A also contended that the different sub-soil profiles and compositions``are particularly relevant viticulturally because grape vines typicallyroot in the sub-soil, not just the topsoil.'' (Hearing Comment 84, p. 11).<T3>ii. Zinke Geography Report.</T3> In its post-hearing comment (HearingComment 101), S. Anderson Vineyard included a soils report prepared byProfessor Paul Zinke, a professor in the Department of Forestry, Universityof California, Berkeley. Professor Zinke concluded, on the basis of observationshe made while visiting the proposed Stags Leap District and its surroundingarea, a review of various soil surveys, soil maps and topographical maps,and soil samples taken on a second visit to the proposed viticultural area,that the soils of the Stags Leap District (including the northern extension),are consistent throughout the properties stretching from a line followingthe small drainage channel approximately parallel to and immediately northof the Yountville Cross Road, west of the Silverado Trail, south to a pointnear the Chimney Rock Golf Course. He found that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The distinctive soil aspect of the Proposed Stags Leap District, includingthe Northern Extension, is a catena or topographic sequence of soils beginningin the east with a terrace against the base of the Stags Leap Ridge atan elevation of approximately 200 feet, continuing with an alluvial fanon which soils of the Bale series occur, then to the lower end where thefan buries deposits of the Napa River in the west. These distinctive combinationsof soils occur several places in the Stags Leap District from immediatelynorth of the Yountville Cross Road to near the Chimney Rock Golf Course.(Hearing Comment 101, Zinke Report, p. 1).</ITAG>Professor Zinke stated that the Reactor Creek (Canyon) Fan begins at adrainage ditch which is approximately parallel to, and just north of theYountville Cross Road. According to Professor Zinke:<ITAG tagnum="21">This is the line where the soils change from those of the Stags LeapDistrict to the coarser soils of the Rector Creek Fan. North of this drainageditch the soils begin to be dominated by the Rector Creek alluvial fan.(Hearing Comment 101, Zinke Report, p. 8).</ITAG><T3>SCS and USGS Reports. </T3>ATF was thus presented with conflictingreports from two experts in the field as to the characteristics of thesoils in the northern extension. Both Professors Elliott-Fisk and Zinkeacknowledged the presence of a Rector Canyon (Creek) Fan, and believedthat Rector Canyon soils were different from Stags Leap District soils.However, whereas Professor Elliott-Fisk believed that the Rector CanyonFan begins at the northern hills at the northern boundary of the proposedviticultural area, Professor Zinke believed that it began some 500 yardsnorth of the hills, on the north side of the Yountville Cross Road. The evidence submitted led ATF to the conclusion that the soils and subsoilswere the primary geographical feature that distinguished the Stags LeapDistrict from surrounding areas. In order to better evaluate the conflictingexpert evidence which had been submitted on the issue of soils, ATF forwardedcopies of the reports of Professors Elliott-Fisk and Zinke to the SCS andthe United States Geological Survey (USGS) for their review and response.By letter dated May 16, 1988, the SCS responded to ATF's request. (RequestedInformation 5). The SCS was unable to reach any definitive conclusionsfrom the evidence before it, but did address Professor Elliott-Fisk's assertionthat the soils in the northern extension had been incorrectly classifiedon the SCS map. The SCS included with its response an internal memorandum,dated May 5, 1988, which stated that almost all soil delineations containsmall areas of other soils, often quite contrasting soils, which are called``inclusions.'' The letter stated that ``it is important to note that thesample sites in her (Professor Elliott-Fisk's) report do not necessarilyconfirm that Bale soils similar to those described south of the `RectorCanyon Fan' line do not exist within the northern extension proposed byZinke.''By letter dated June 9, 1988, the USGS submitted its review of the data.(Requested Information 7). The letter noted that the reviewer was merelyanalyzing the reports, and did not have the advantage of a field review,detailed photographic review, or review of the data collected by eitherconsultant. The reviewer concluded that there were reasonable argumentsand data to support either position of the northern boundary. The USGS reviewer noted the heterogeneity of soil types within the proposedStags Leap District. (As previously mentioned, of the 31 soil series presentwithin Napa County, approximately 45% of these are found in the viticulturalarea.) Thus, because of the diversity of soil types, the USGS believedthat it was important to ascertain whether the soils in the northern extensionwere similar to those in the proposed viticultural area, or uniquely different.In addition, the USGS believed it important to determine whether the soilsin the northern extension were more like the Rector Canyon (Fan) depositsand soils than the Stags Leap District soils since, as previously noted,both Professors Elliott-Fisk and Zinke believed that Rector Canyon soilswere different from Stags Leap District soils. The USGS concluded that, in their opinion, there was insufficient dataavailable to argue that the soils in the northern extension (south of theYountville Cross Road) are significantly different from those within theproposed Stags Leap District. Further, the USGS opined that a more detailedstudy could conclude that the soils in the northern extension are transitionalto both the Rector Canyon Fan and the Stags Leap materials. In any event,based on the available data, the USGS concluded that the soils in the northernextension appear to be more similar to the soils within the proposed viticulturalarea than to the soils north of the Yountville Cross Road. Although the USGS stated that it could not recommend that a solely geologic,geomorphologic, or soils basis be used to determine the northern boundaryof the district, the Bureau would note that viticultural area boundariesare not based solely on geographical features. On the basis of geographical criteria, ATF finds that the area within theproposed Stags Leap District and the area within the northern extensionare not distinguishable from one another. The evidence indicates that theclimate, soil, precipitation, etc. within the area proposed by Group A,and the area within the northern extension proposed by Group B, are virtuallythe same. Although there are differences, ATF finds that there is insufficientevidence to indicate that these differences distinguish the proposed areasfrom one another. ATF finds that the weight of the evidence supports the SCS map's classificationof the soils in the northern extension as being predominantly Bale clayloam. Further, ATF finds that the evidence supports the conclusion of theUSGS that the soils within the northern extension are more similar to thesoils found in the proposed Stags Leap District than to the soils foundnorth of the Yountville Cross Road. Therefore, ATF concludes, based onthe evidence, that the northern extension area is distinguished by viticulturalfeatures from the remaining surrounding areas. In summation, ATF finds that the boundaries proposed by Group B satisfythe criteria of 27 CFR 4.25a(e)(2)(iii) by encompassing an area that possessesgenerally homogeneous viticultural features different from surroundingareas which are distinguished by geographical features. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Final Rule_Boundary Modifications</ITAG>Based on the evidence in the rulemaking record, with the exception of thenorthern boundary, ATF is adopting the boundaries of the Stags Leap Districtviticultural area as proposed in Notice No. 620. ATF finds that the evidencesubmitted by Group B satisfies the criteria specified in andSection; 4.25a(d)(2)of the regulations, and the northern boundary of the Stags Leap Districtviticultural area as proposed in Notice No. 620 is, therefore, modifiedto extend to the Yountville Cross Road.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Boundaries of the Area </ITAG>The boundaries of the Stags Leap District viticultural area may be foundon one United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) map of the 7.5 minuteseries, titled Yountville, California. The boundaries are described inandSection; 9.117. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Additional Information </ITAG>A. Miscellaneous ATF does not want to give the impression that, by approving ``Stags LeapDistrict'' as a viticultural area, it is approving or endorsing the qualityof the wine from this area. ATF is approving this area as being distinct,but not better than other areas. By approving this area, ATF will allowwine producers to claim a distinction on labels and in advertisements asto the origin of the grapes. Any commercial advantage can only come fromconsumer acceptance of ``Stags Leap District'' wines. B.
