It's profitable, it'sgrowing, it exceeds all minimum capital requirements, it hasa good staff and great customers. But right now, I'm thinkingabout selling it. I don't want to sell for the usual reasons.We don't have too many bad loans. In fact, we have no&quot;underwater&quot; (below book value) assets on our books -- ararity among banks.   We are not facing brutal competition or having aparticularly tough time making money. We have a good positionin our market: We rank about 2,000th in size among thenation's 15,000 banks and thrifts, and first in size amongindependent banks in town (the other two big banks sold outyears ago to large regionals). We are experiencing recordlevels of residential mortgage loan activity. And a majorcorporation just announced plans to locate a huge newfacility in our town. This alone will bring 2,000 jobs and aclear multi-year boon to the local economy. So why am Ireluctant to stay in the game?</LP><TEXT>   The answers are found in the dark side of banking reform.Few legislators, depositors or taxpayers see this dark side,but it's increasingly evident to investors. When investorslike me look at the combined effects of the relatively newrisk-based capital rules affecting banks and the reformpackage likely to pass soon, we see that bank returns will beso depressed and operational freedoms so circumscribed thatwe might do better to find other industries.   A rigid risk-based system for setting deposit insurancepremiums and calculating capital ratios will cause my bank toshift its lending and investment appetites from, for example,profitable local community business lending to lower yieldingTreasury bill investing.   If the proposed $100,000 per depositor limit on depositinsurance per institution (or $200,000 including retirementsavings) resurfaces, it -- combined with the perpetuation of&quot;too big to fail&quot; -- will cause my large depositors to siphonoff funds to one or more of the 35 failure-proof largeregional and money center banks.   Federal deposit insurance premiums will be going up andoften.The cost of extensive and frequent regulatoryexaminations (including the staff and administrative cost ofcompliance) will rise. Mounting capital requirements thatout-pace new sources of earnings will reduce my returns. Andcontrary to what drafters of banking reform say, I won't beable to recover profits by entering new businesses likesecurities, mutual fund sponsorship or insurance. My bank,together with more than 95% of all banks, can't afford thestart-up costs and skills required to get into thesebusinesses beyond the brokering role we already play.   It is also clear to me that our board of directors andmanagement team will be forced to relegate our shareholderand employee interests not just to the back seat, but to thetrunk of the car, in deference to regulators in the driversseat.   Today, there is little communication at the trench levelamong the four regulatory agencies (the Office of theComptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Office of ThriftSupervision, and the Federal Reserve). Standards as a resultdiffer dramatically among these bodies. But when the agenciesare restructured, institutions that have dealt for years withthe same examiner will find that their previous examinationshave been discounted and that new, stricter standards arebeing applied by new examiners intent on putting teeth intoregulation. A likely side effect of this banking reform willbe a prolonged credit crunch in my bank's town and othersacross the country, as bankers fearful of vigilant examinerscool their lending heels the way they have done during thepast two years in the Northeast.   In this respect, the history of the thrift industry willrepeat itself. Since the passage of the thrift bailoutlegislation in 1989 more board directors and investors havebeen trying to exit the thrift industry than to get in. EvenBill Seidman said, &quot;if you teach them enough, you won't haveany,&quot; referring to directors' mounting responsibilities andliabilities. In the worst case, a bank that under currentregulation is &quot;marginal&quot; could be reclassified as a failedbank. More likely, though, a new examiner could imposeadditional conditions on operations -- ranging fromrestricting dividends, to requiring changes in management, toprohibiting growth and business diversification, to requiringthe use of an outside consultant, to mandating the bank'ssale]   And then there will be the all-too-frequent supervisoryannoyances. They've begun already. One of my bank's directorsowns the largest string of grocery stores in the market. Ourbranch managers cannot purchase $50 worth of cakes and sodafrom his stores to host a customer open house unless the bankfirst applies to our regulator for approval for thispurchase, and then gets our board of directors to formallyokay it. The bank's regulator also recently demanded in anelaborate letter and oral communication that the boardconsider seeking restitution in the amount of $17.32 from ahighly regarded manager who had taken a subordinate to lunchto discuss departmental restructuring.   Nobody questions the need for banking reform, or fortougher regulatory oversight. Although I believe that somebanks can represent great investments, the next few yearswill bring a regulatory overreaction to the easy-going early1980s. This is bad news for the industry, which desperatelyneeds more capital. It's also bad news for my bank'scommunity -- which may be destined for the wrong reasons tolose its largest remaining independent bank to some largerplayer.   ---   Mr. Stock is the general partner of First FinancialPartners, a bank investment fund in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
