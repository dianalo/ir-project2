BP has said recently that itintends to focus future operations on three core areas:exploration and production, refining and marketing andchemicals.   For Elf, the acquisition reinforces the Frenchstate-controlled company's downstream operations, which havetended to concentrate on petrochemicals, and reaffirms Elf'sambition to improve the balance between its explorationactivities and its refining businesses. Elf Aquitaine has along history in West Africa, but so far the group has beenactive mainly in exploration and production. In addition tothe refining operations, the African acquisition includes 650service stations.   It is the second time in two years that Elf has acquiredassets from BP.
