Some farmers, moonlighters and pipesmokers will help pick up the tab.   After a month of off-and-on work behind closed doors, thecommittee on Thursday voted 33-3 for a package providing $7.1billion in specialized tax relief over the next three years.Because of budget restrictions the bill also carries the taxincreases to pay for the cuts.   The bill originally was designed solely to correct hundreds oferrors that showed up in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986.But since this is the only tax bill with a chance of passingCongress this year, committee members ended up adding numerousamendments extending some expiring tax benefits and dozens ofothers providing relief to specialized groups of taxpayers.   For example, the bill would allow an 80 percent tax deductionfor contributions to college athletic scholarship funds when such``gifts'' guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket.   Because the bill would raise other taxes on some people, thereis enough controversy associated with it to make enactment far lessthan certain. For one thing, the Reagan administration opposes someof the increases.   Too, there is some doubt that Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, will interrupt his vicepresidential campaign to handle a bill that raises taxes on anybody.   Some of the dozens of provisions in the bill would:   _Allow rural mail carriers to deduct 33.75 cents for each mile apersonal car is driven on a mail route; most people are allowedjust 22.5 cents a mile for business-related mileage.   _Give certain producers of pistachio nuts a break on how theyaccount for production costs.   _Exempt freelance writers, artists and photographers from a newrequirement that they deduct expenses of an endeavor only after itstarts producing income.   _Impose a tax of $2.67 per pound of pipe tobacco; that isequivalent to the existing 16-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes.   _Tighten depreciation provisions for single-purpose farmstructures, such as poultry houses, and farm machinery.   _Prohibit any person with a home-based business (includingmoonlighters) from deducting any part of the base monthly telephonecharge as a business expense.   _Renew at a reduced level the tax exclusion foremployer-provided educational assistance. Only $1,500 of such aidper year could avoid tax, down from $5,250.   _Extend several expiring provisions, including credits forresearch and experimentation and for owners of low-income rentalhousing and a tax exemption for bonds used to help lower-incomefamilies buy their first home.   _Relieve farmers from a 1987 requirement that they pay tax onoff-road diesel fuel and then apply for a refund.   _Allow owners of mutual fund shares to deduct certain fundexpenses without regard to the usual 2 percent floor undermiscellaneous deductions.   _Remove some tax benefits from single-premium life insurancepolicies.   _Raise taxes on various corporations, including those that ownparts of other corporations and defense contractors.   _Assure that fellowships created to honor the memory ofChallenger astronaut Christa McAuliffe are tax-free so long as therecipient teacher uses the money for academic improvement.   _Permit operators of offshore or Alaska oil rigs and of somecommercial vessels (but not luxury liners) to deduct the full costof meals provided to employees; most business may deduct only 80percent.   _Allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on certain profitsfrom the sale of a principal home, just as though the spouse hadnot died. Present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after ahome is sold and before a new one is built.</TEXT></DOC>
