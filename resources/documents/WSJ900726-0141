TheIraqi leader has been the annoying buzz at the galacelebrating the end of the cold war. But Western politicalleaders have preferred to ignore him, since they are havingsuch a good time.   It's been more fun, in the mood of general revelry, towithdraw military power, especially from the Mediterranean.All summer, Congressional Democrats have been ridiculing aPentagon plan to build a base at Crotone, in southern Italy.The base would enable NATO to project air power throughoutthe Middle East. &quot;Given the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, whydo we need another NATO air base?&quot; asks Senator Jim Sasser.Rep. Pat Schroeder, eager to save domestic bases, calls theCrotone base &quot;a waste of money.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, the U.S. announced that it was closing twoMediterranean bases in Greece, to consolidate forces on asingle base on Crete. Greek leftists rioted against any U.S.military presence.   On Monday, the usually sensible Rep. Les Aspin said hewould oppose future production of the B-2 Stealth bomber,which can evade radar and hit terrorist or other targets. InMay, the Canadian defense minister announced that, owing toglobal peace, NATO was cancelling plans for a fightertraining base where pilots from 11 nations would have learnedto fly low-altitude attack missions.   But Saddam Hussein's annoying buzz is now so loud itshould be heard even above the din of Europhoria. U.S. forcesalready have started exercises in the Persian Gulf. Maybeit's time to put away the party hats and remember thathistory hasn't ended.   At first glance, Mr. Hussein's outrageous bullying ofKuwait seems like lunatic belligerency. His thuggery divertsattention from Israel, over whom the Arabs have been winningpropaganda victories of late. Moreover, it dashes Mr.Hussein's chances of becoming the indisputed leader of theArab world. This episode has spooked a lot of Arab leaderswho were happy to cheer him on as he threatened to gas halfof Israel. Now moderate Egypt is acting like the keystone ofthe Arab states.   But there are kernels of rationality in his recentbehavior. Iraq's peace with Iran now looks like part of alarger strategy. Some of the nearly 700,000 Iraqi soldiers onthe Iranian border now can be directed toward easier prey.Iraq has twice as many soldiers as Kuwait has citizens. Withthreats that it would &quot;break necks,&quot; Iraq now is demanding&quot;massive reparations&quot; for alleged Kuwaiti oil thefts (inreality both sides seem to be stealing from each other). Iraqalso seeks forgiveness on the $10 billion debt it owesKuwait. Yesterday's diplomatic moves suggested that theextortion was likely to work.   This week's events also signal that the Iraqi dictator iswilling to serve as OPEC's enforcer. The fall in oil priceshas put restraints on the amount of money Mr. Hussein couldspend on his war machine. His government has said it wouldlike to see oil at $25 a barrel, and he clearly is willing tointimidate Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates if theycontinue to violate their quotas. Remember that Mr. Husseinbombed the UAE oil rigs in 1986 because he thought thecountry was not supporting him sufficiently in the war withIran.   The Saudis, though frightened by Mr. Hussein's thuggery,clearly appreciate Iraqi efforts to boost prices. We may yetsee the restoration of the Iran-Iraq-Saudi dominance of OPECthat led to the ruinous price rises of the 1970s.   For the past several years, while the West studiously hasbeen looking the other way, Iraq has built up a substantialmunitions industry and one of the world's largest armies. Mr.Hussein builds his own ammunition, mortars, bombs andmissiles. Though his attempts to get a supergun were foiled,he has no trouble buying other weaponry, often from Europe.The U.S. State Department resists any attempt to impose eveneconomic sanctions on the country. The European diplomaticposture has been to lay low. Kuwait gave more than $30billion in military aid; obviously appeasement doesn't work.   Mr. Hussein's violent rise has transformed the Middle Eastproblem. The major flashpoint is no longer the Syrian-Israelidispute. Now, the eye of the storm is in Baghdad, and itradiates out in all directions, militarily and economically.   Mr. Hussein personifies the type of military menace likelyto persist and grow even if the Soviet threat fades (itselfno safe assumption, given the Soviet Union's huge andundiminished strategic arsenal). Aside from humanitarianconsiderations, Western interests would be immediatelyjeopardized by an invasion of Kuwait and a newly militantOPEC. In today's exquisitely interdependent world, we need tothink again about the ancient military mission known assuppression of piracy. Today's pirates come with chemical andconceivably even nuclear weapons, and aren't likely to bedeterred by the mantra, &quot;peace is breaking out all over.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
