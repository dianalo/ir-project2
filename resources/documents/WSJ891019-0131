AMR's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records. Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988.    Still, AMR's stumble doesn't bode well for the rest of the industry. The Fort Worth, Texas, company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business, and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days.    Meanwhile, the company's board, which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump's recently withdrawn $7.5 billion offer for AMR, issued a statement condemning &quot;ill-conceived and reckless&quot; bids and saying it was &quot;pleased&quot; that Mr. Trump had backed out.    In the third quarter, AMR said, net fell to $137 million, or $2.16 a share, from $150.3 million, or $2.50 a share. Revenue rose 17% to $2.73 billion from $2.33 billion a year earlier.    AMR's chairman, Robert L. Crandall, said the results were due to an 11% year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield, an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold.    &quot;We think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well,&quot; he said. Tim Pettee, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said: &quot;The business turned faster than expected. Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble, and the whole industry is having a pricing problem.&quot;    For the nine months, AMR's net rose 15% to $415.9 million, or $6.59 a share, from $360.1 million, or $5.99 a share. Revenue jumped 22% to $7.89 billion from $6.46 billion.    AMR's board, in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday, said: &quot;Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee, financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders. . . . AMR has not been, and is not, for sale.&quot;    Mr. Crandall said the company's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather.    &quot;Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
