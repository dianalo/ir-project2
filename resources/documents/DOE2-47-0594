<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-0594 </DOCNO><TEXT>Describes a new coupling designed by Ostroj, Opava, which disconnectspower from plow installation when a pre-set degree of resistance is met.It was designed to be reliable under all conditions, to have the sameservice life as the related plow and to require minimum maintenance.The coupling forms part of PCE 100N transmission systems on PL-81 andPL-82 plow installations and is able to transmit torque up to 55.2 kNmwith maximum chain power of up to 300 kN. It takes only 0.2 s to disconnectmotors after slippage is detected and it then idles for a maximum of5 s. Briefly discusses trials at the Staric mine in the Ostrava-Karvinacoalfield at a coal face 108 m long and 1.32 m thick, where the averagenumber of power disconnections per shift was 13 with drive chain cut-outset at 240 kN. Concludes that this system, which is now in series production,is of simple construction, cheap, reliable and simple to maintain. 5refs.</TEXT></DOC>
