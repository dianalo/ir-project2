A 78-year-old man who was shot in the back and beaten May 31died Sunday at Jamaica Hospital. He was one of four men who havebeen shot by the so-called ``Zodiac'' gunman since March.   The city's chief of detectives, Joseph Borrelli, said it wasonly luck that the three other victims were still alive.   ``I think he is intending to shoot them and kill them,''Borrelli said.   The Zodiac shot his latest victim Thursday, a homeless mansleeping on a Central Park bench. All four victims were vulnerable,including a 50-year-old man who used a cane to steady a limp and a33-year-old man who was tipsy.   At least one of the victims _ the latest one _ was stalkedbecause of his astrological sign, police said.   Larry Parnham, the wounded homeless man, told detectives he wasbefriended days before the shooting by a stranger who asked him hisbirth date, Borrelli said.   The day after the shooting, a note taking responsibility andintroducing the writer as the ``Zodiac'' was received by the NewYork Post.   The birth dates of all four victims correspond to astrologicalsigns scrawled in notes written by the killer, Borrelli said.   ``We were concerned and we were confused as to the manner inwhich these shootings were happening under the sign of theindividual victim,'' he said. ``When you get four out of four, Ithink it goes beyond luck.''   Police believe the gunman has copied the methods of California'sZodiac killer, a man who claimed responsibility for as many as 40killings in a series of notes sent to San Francisco-area newspapersfrom 1968 to 1987.   In the most recent letter to the Post, the gunman claimed to bethe same man who terrorized California. But police said they don'tbelieve that.   Astrologers had warned police that the first day of summer, whenthe Central Park shooting occurred, was considered a significantday, because the zodiac changed from the sign of Gemini to the signof Cancer.   After the Central Park shooting, Borrelli said: ``This opens upa whole new Pandora's box. We've got the whole city now to belooking at.''   Police have a Zodiac Task Force of about 50 officers on thecase, Borrelli said.</TEXT></DOC>
