The Rev. David R. Johnson, 36, said he knew testifying wouldjeopardize his career and devastate his family, but he wasconcerned Charles Neff, 22, could be imprisoned for a crime he didnot commit.   ``I thought to myself, if the Lord could be in my position _bizarre as it is _ what would he do in my situation?'' Johnsonsaid. ``Would he not testify, would he testify and lie, or would hetestify and tell the truth?   ``The choice I came to was testify, tell the truth, only thetruth, and live with what comes afterward.''   Johnson took the witness stand Thursday in the courtroom ofAllegheny County Common Pleas Judge Robert Kelly and testified _ asdid 11 other witnesses _ that Neff was drinking at a bar Nov. 26,1988, at the time he is alleged to have raped a 21-year-old woman.   Johnson also testified, under questioning by defense attorney H.David Rothman, that he and Neff had been lovers.   Johnson met Friday with Bishop Donald Wuerl of the CatholicDiocese of Pittsburgh and requested _ and received _ an indefiniteleave of absence.   He was relieved of all priestly duties and responsibilities,including his role as chaplain at Forbes Regional Health Center insuburban Monroeville, said the Rev. Ronald Lengwin, spokesman forthe diocese.   The diocese plans to review Johnson's actions to determine hisfuture as a priest, Lengwin said.   Johnson, 36, a priest for 10 years, said he will return to hisfamily's home in Pittsburgh. His decision, he said, is best for thechurch, his family and himself.   ``I feel a sense of relief, like a weight has been lifted,'' hesaid. ``I want to be there for my parents and my brother.''   Frank said he met Neff a couple years ago during the ThreeRivers Regatta. Until about a year ago, Johnson said he served as acounselor, friend and lover to Neff.   Neff, 22, was charged about a year ago with rape, indecentassault, simple assault and unlawful restraint. Jurors are expectedto begin deliberations later today after closing arguments.   Neff has previous convictions for stabbing a girlfriend andsoliciting a city detective for sex. He served 23 months in thecounty jail for the stabbing and was placed on probation for a yearfor soliciting the detective.</TEXT></DOC>
