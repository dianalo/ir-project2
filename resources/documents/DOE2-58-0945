The process depends upon the measurementsof the vacuum pressure of the remaining air in the sampling loop afterimmersing it in an ice-water bath. From the insignificant differencesof the estimated air-concentrations for the various experimental runsit can be concluded that the sampling loop process is of satisfactoryperformance in estimating air traces in flowing steam-air mixtures.</TEXT></DOC>
