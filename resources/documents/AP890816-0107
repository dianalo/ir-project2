In remarks at a fund-raiser on behalf of Republican congressionalcandidate Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in a city long a magnet for Cubanemigres, Bush said he will look for indications that Castro willfollow the moves toward openness now exhibited by his Soviet-blocallies.   ``Someday I'd like to see improved _ yes, normalized _ relationswith Cuba. But that cannot and it will not be as long as Castroviolates the human rights of his own people; as long as he, almostalone in the entire world now, swims against the tide that isbringing sweeping change, democracy and freedom to closed societiesaround the world,'' he said.   ``As president, I will look for signs that Castro wants to moveaway from subverting his neighbors, move toward more openness, morefreedom for his own people. But until I see demonstrable changethere will be no improvement in relations with Cuba,'' Bush declaredto warm applause. ``It simply cannot be.''   The United States severed relations with Cuba in 1961. The twonations currently are represented in each other's capital by``interest sections'' rather than full-fledged embassies.   The president embarked on a three-week Maine vacation today bytaking a roundabout route from Washington to boost Ros-Lehtinen'sbid to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper in a Housedistrict that includes many Cuban-Americans and other Hispanics.   The Cuban-born candidate's campaign manager is Bush's son, Jeb.   Bush's trip to Miami comes amid a bitter debate over JusticeDepartment efforts to deport an anti-Castro Cuban militant, Dr.Orlando Bosch. The Justice Department says secret U.S. intelligenceinformation implicates Bosch in bombings and assassination attemptsduring Castro's 30-year rule of Cuba.   Bosch's supporters, including Ros-Lehtinen, view him as a hero inthe battle against Castro. Ros-Lehtinen said she planned to ask thepresident to overrule the deportation order, and Sen. Connie Mack,R-Fla., has requested a meeting with Bush on the matter.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, however, thatthe president could not address the case. ``It's a matter before thelegal system and we can't comment on it,'' he said.   Bush called Ros-Lehtinen ``the kind of uncompromising,experienced crime-fighter we need in Washington right now.''   And, in a district whose ethnic voting population is critical tocampaign strategies, Bush said that Ros-Lehtinen has ``an increasedsensitivity to the problems of all oppressed minorities, whereverthey may be.''   He recounted a story about her grandfather who helped smuggleJewish refugees out of Cuba ``wehn Castro's tyranny crushed freedomon the island.''   The president was campaigning for the 37-year-old educator as theGOP eyed what it considers a golden opportunity to add to its 10-8majority in Florida's congressional delegation.   Pepper held the seat for the Democrats from its inception untilhis death 27 years later, May 30 at age 88.   Ros-Lehtinen will face Gerald Richman, who won the Democraticnomination in a heated runoff Tuesday night, in the Aug. 29 election.   Bush was to travel to Kennebunkport, Maine, later today to spendthe next 20 days at his family compound by the sea. Bush's staffsaid the Maine trip would be mostly recreational, with Bush's familyand friends on hand.   First lady Barbara Bush has spent most of the month there.   However, Bush is expecting visits from Canadian Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney and Danish Prime Minister Poul Schluter.   The athletic president has spent past trips to Kennebunkport in awhirl of golf, tennis, jogging, swimming, boating, fishing andrestaurant-hopping.   The Florida race is one of several House special elections thisyear in which the Democrats and Republicans are sparring heatedly.Republicans hope to improve their standing of 175 members to 255 forthe Democrats, with five vacancies.   The most recent vacancies were created by the deaths of TexasDemocrat Mickey Leland and Mississippi Republican Larkin Smith. Theydied in separate plane crashes.   Ros-Lehtinen, whose resignation after seven years as a statelegislator is effective Aug. 29, won the four-way race for GOPnomination with 83 percent of the vote.   The Democratic runoff was charged with ethnic innuendo.   Richman, a lawyer, said repeatedly that the seat is ``an Americanseat.'' His opponent was Cuban-born Rosario Kennedy, who came to theUnited States when she was 14.</TEXT></DOC>
