The sampleof the first mode is continued until the detector count rate reachesa predetermined maximum. The detector establishes a control signal whichis applied to terminate the first mode effluent flow to the chamber,evacuate the chamber to a predetermined value of vacuum and connect theeffluent into the sample chamber with a predetermined mode of flow ratedifferent from the rate of the first mode to establish a sample concentrationin the chamber within the range of the detector. A subsequent predeterminedminimum rate will generate a signal to reconnect the sample chamber tothe first mode connection and thereby cycle the system back to its firstmode of operation.</TEXT></DOC>
