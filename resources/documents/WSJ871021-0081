Separately, United Telecommunications Inc. posted a 51% decline in third-quarter earnings.    GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., reported net income of $296.7 million, or 86 cents a share, down from $324.6 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding after-tax gains of $16 million, or five cents a share, in the latest quarter, and gains of $32 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier, GTE said earnings per share dropped 6%. Revenue grew 1% to $3.81 billion from $3.78 billion.    GTE's 50% share of pretax losses at its US Sprint Communications Co. long-distance joint venture grew to $83 million, from $79 million in last year's third quarter. Analysts, however, were heartened by the reduction of losses from the 1987 second quarter, when US Sprint posted a total pretax operating loss of $286 million.    &quot;The big story is the turnaround in Sprint,&quot; said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber Inc. &quot;This quarter proved that Sprint has not only turned the corner, but is running around the block very quickly.&quot;    The other partner in US Sprint, Kansas City, Mo.-based United Telecommunications, said third-quarter net fell to $24.1 million, or 23 cents a share, from $49.6 million, or 49 cents a share. But profit improved from the first two quarters, when huge US Sprint losses severely depressed United Telecommunications' earnings. Revenue rose 6.6% to $755.4 million from $708.3 million.    Robert Morris, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said GTE's earnings were lower mostly because lower tax rates didn't completely offset lower operating earnings from local telephone operations, which are posting higher depreciation costs. GTE said it also had gains from sales of certain businesses in last year's third quarter that were unusually high.    For the nine months, GTE reported earnings fell 14% to $784.6 million, or $2.30 a share, from $916 million, or $2.74 a share, mostly because of a one-time special charge in this year's second quarter that reduced per-share earnings 31 cents. Revenue rose 2% to $11.3 billion from $11.1 billion.    United Telecommunications reported a nine months loss of $80.7 million, compared with profit of $152.3 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped to $2.2 billion from $2.3 billion.    Both companies said they were encouraged with US Sprint, which reported higher revenue and smaller losses than those reported in the second quarter. Analysts said that in the third quarter, US Sprint reported an operating loss of $165 million, compared with the $282 million operating loss in the second quarter. Revenue exceeded analysts' expectations, growing to $685 million from $546 million, including a $76 million write-off, in the second quarter, analysts said. Mr. Grubman said he believed traffic on US Sprint's network in the third quarter was 9% higher than in the second quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
