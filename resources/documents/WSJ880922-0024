Supreme Court Justice John Stevens stayed the March 1988 order of a federal district judge in Chicago that barred a strike by the labor organizations that make up the Railway Labor Executives' Association.    The railroad, a unit of CNW Corp., operates freight rails in several states and commuter service around Chicago. It announced last December that it planned to sell the 208 miles of track between Green Bay and Milwaukee to a unit of Chicago-based Itel Corp. The sale has been scheduled to be completed tomorrow.    In March, the union threatened to strike if the sale were completed, complaining that the railroad had failed to reach agreements on the status of more than 200 jobs that would be eliminated by the sale. A strike was blocked by the federal judge's injunction, and the sale was held up while the union appealed. On Aug. 23, a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled against the union, continuing to bar a strike.    The union has appealed the labor law issues to the Supreme Court, and that appeal still is pending. Last night, Justice Stevens said that until the high court decides in the next few months whether to hear the union's appeal, the union may strike.    A CNW spokesman said company officials don't know yet what, if any, effect the court's ruling will have on the planned sale. He said CNW officials may have a better idea of whether the sale will go through as planned after discussing the latest development with Itel officials today.    CNW has been racked with labor turmoil in the past year. Earlier this month, it resolved a long-running contract dispute over its plan to reduce the size of train crews. The company and its unionized employees reached a compromise on the issue only after congressional and presidential intervention.    The dispute over whether railroad companies must reach an accommodation with their unions before selling trackage is one of the most critical issues facing the railroad industry. Federal courts so far have issued mixed rulings on the matter.    A Supreme Court ruling in the CNW case would have widespread implications. The court's action yesterday in suspending the prohibition against a strike has made lawyers for the railway union optimistic that the court also will agree to hear the union's appeal of the planned sale.    James Kennedy, executive secretary-treasurer of the Railway Labor Executives' Association, said he and other union leaders would meet with their lawyer last night to decide what their next step should be. &quot;Our goal . . . is to get them to do what they should have done all along,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll have to make a judgment about what makes sense.&quot;    ---   Judith Valente in Chicago contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
