Robert Dole have decided to stop attacking each other in their campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.    Campaigning in New Hampshire yesterday, Mr. Bush said he made a &quot;mistake&quot; by engaging in a series of bitter exchanges with Sen. Dole and vowed that he would &quot;stay on the high road&quot; and talk about issues in the future.    &quot;I responded a week ago to a series of attacks,&quot; he said. &quot;I made a mistake.&quot;    Sen. Dole, also in New Hampshire, was making an effort throughout the day to play down the dispute, and even before Mr. Bush's comments was saying the two men should put the dispute behind them. Characterizing the fighting as &quot;Mickey Mouse,&quot; he welcomed Mr. Bush's statement and said the American people didn't want them throwing &quot;brickbats&quot; at each other. &quot;A lot of people believe one of us is going to be elected,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
