Just Change the Formula   ----   By Lee Berton</HL><DATE>04/17/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE R5</SO><LP>   For several years, the formula for determining a chiefexecutive's bonus has been pretty simple: As profits or stockprices rise, so does the bonus.   But hard times are changing that.</LP><TEXT>   With corporate profits skidding and the stock marketbouncing erratically, more companies are turning away fromtraditional pay formulas that depend on earnings andstock-price growth. Instead, they are patching togetherinnovative systems that take into account everything fromquality improvement to buying and selling assets.   The upshot: Executive pay can soar even when the company-- by traditional measures -- does poorly.   Graef Crystal, a compensation specialist and adjunctprofessor of business administration at the Haas School ofBusiness, University of California at Berkeley, recentlysurveyed the measures used to compensate 955 chief executivesof big companies.   Fewer than 4.2% of these chief executives were compensatedbased on the traditional measures of their companies'five-year growth in sales, three-year return on investedcapital and five-year stock-price appreciation, Mr. Crystalsays.   &quot;Companies are making up new compensation models as theygo along,&quot; says Mr. Crystal. &quot;It's the game of `if the oldformula or model doesn't work, find a new one that does.'&quot;   Here's how these new compensation models work:                                                                                                          PEER COMPARISONS                                                                                                          Chief-executive bonuses typically are drawn from a poolmade up of a percentage of net income that exceeds a certainreturn on equity; say 5% of the net that exceeds an 8% returnon equity. But if net income falls, so does the bonus pool.   Unless, that is, a company changes its absoluteperformance standards to relative ones. When companiescompare peformance with a group of competitors, the chiefexecutive of the best-performing company would get a payraise -- even if every company in the group is doing poorly.   &quot;More companies are marking executive performance on thecurve,&quot; says Diane Posnak, a partner in Pearl Meyer andamp;Partners, executive-compensation consultant. &quot;That's becauselinking bonuses to internal financial goals alone in a downeconomy doesn't motivate top executives to perform well.&quot;   A check of 1990 proxies shows that peer comparisons fortop-management compensation are being used by a wide range ofpublic companies, including Public Service Enterprise Group,Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., AMR Corp., Coast SavingsFinancial Inc., Comerica Inc. and Citadel Holding Corp.   Companies in troubled industries are especially likely toturn to this method. A recent survey of 1990 proxies byaccounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick shows that peer comparisonsare becoming increasingly popular among banks, thriftinstitutions and insurance companies. According to thesurvey, such comparisons were used by 14% offinancial-service firms, up from 9% the year before.   Such a comparison was reported last year by Cigna Corp.,an insurance and financial-services company. Cigna says ithas been using comparisons for a few years, and declines togive further details. But compensation consultants say thatthe comparison appears to have slightly enhanced the pay ofWilson Taylor, Cigna's chief executive.   Cigna reported profits in 1987, 1988 and 1989 far belowits record 1986 results, and Cigna's return on equity, 10.2%in 1989, was far below that of some industry leaders. Butthat didn't prompt a decline in pay; according to last year'sproxy, Mr. Taylor's 1989 salary and bonus rose by 2%, to$1,103,000.   Comparing Cigna's return on equity with the 8.7% earned bycompetitor Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Corp. might offer someexplanation, as the return on equity is considered aprincipal gauge of peer comparison among competing companies.During that same period, the salary and bonus of Aetna'schief executive, J. T. Lynn, fell 7%, to $1,052,000.                                                                                                          PAYING FOR CASH FLOW                                                                                                          When a public company is taken private and equity isreplaced by debt, investment bankers say that free cash flow-- the cash on hand after paying all expenses includinginterest payments on the debt -- is a key to the company'sfuture success. Thus, more companies are basing compensationon free cash flow.   This can mean big payments to executives even inmoney-losing companies. At RJR Nabisco Inc. last year, ChiefExecutive Louis Gerstner received $500,000 more than the $2.5million already promised him in compensation, even though thecompany had a loss of $429 million.   The reason: In 1989, after RJR Nabisco underwent thebiggest leveraged buy-out in the U.S., the company reported aloss of $1.15 billion. Free cash flow, which can be used torun operations and possibly to pay off principal on debt, was$647 million. In 1990, free cash flow climbed to $2.7billion. &quot;The loss was significantly less than we planned,and the cash flow was $1 billion higher than expected,&quot; saysJason Wright, an RJR vice president.   Mr. Wright says company filings with the Secutities andExchange Commission don't disclose criteria for the extra$500,000 in compensation. &quot;Mr. Gerstner's accomplishmentsspeak for themselves,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          GUARANTEEING COMPENSATION                                                                                                          Mr. Gerstner's compensation package has another featureincreasingly common in companies in need of a turnaround: aguarantee. Many troubled companies feel they can't attracttop-caliber people unless they can be assured of a big paypackage. When Mr. Gerstner joined RJR Nabisco in early 1989,his guaranteed pay equaled the $2.3 million compensation hehad earned as president of American Express Co.   Last year, in luring away Chrysler President GeraldGreenwald, the ultimately unsuccessful group that planned anemployee buy-out of UAL Corp. offered him a package thatincluded a $5 million bonus for signing on with the group,according to people familiar with his compensation. He waspromised an additional $4 million fee if the buy-out fellthrough; if it was completed, his salary and othercompensation were to total more than $12 million over fiveyears.   Peter Chingos, national director of executive-compensationconsulting for KMPG Peat Marwick, says such guarantees aresometimes coupled with requirements that the newly hiredexecutives buy stock in the troubled companies. Such stockpurchases could add up to big windfalls if the turnaround issuccessful, but they also add an element of risk.                                                                                                          FLEXIBLE MEASURES                                                                                                          Some companies also are using flexible measures tocompensate chief executives.   Unlike the traditional fixed formulas, the flexible onesaren't spelled out in the corporate proxies, so it is harderto tell what the chief executive is being paid for. Among theobjectives: divesting underperforming business units,synchronizing technology at diverse factories, restructuringmoney-losing operations and laying off people.   Some companies are turning to a relatively new &quot;sum of theawards&quot; approach, says Louis J. Brindisi Jr., a seniorpartner of Strategic Compensation Associates in New York.Under the traditional formula, a chief executive's entirebonus depends on a target return on equity or investment ofthe company. Using the new method, perhaps only 50% of thechief executive's bonus would be based on return on equity orreturn on investment. An additional 25% would be based oncomparisons with competitors and a final 25% on successfulrestructuring of a troubled division. The percentages set bythe board of directors can differ depending on a company'scircumstances.   &quot;Boards of directors and their compensation committeesaren't locked into specific formulas any more,&quot; says Mr.Brindisi. &quot;They use a number of flexible measures becausethey want to keep good top executives during these toughtimes.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
