<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-19-0673 </DOCNO><TEXT>It has been established that electrostatic ion-cyclotron-like and Kelvin--Helmholtzmodes can be sustained by a transverse velocity shear for Landgt;rho/sub i/,where L is the velocity shear scale length and rho/sub i/ is the iongyroradius. Here it is shown that if rho/sub e/andless;Landless;andless;rho/sub i/, whererho/sub e/ is the electron gyroradius, then a short wavelength electron--ionhybrid mode can be excited around the lower hybrid frequency. Like theKelvin--Helmholtz instability, an explicit dependence on the second derivativeof the dc electric field is essential for the growth of this mode.</TEXT></DOC>
