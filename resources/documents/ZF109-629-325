Magazines The newspaper and magazine Conference session focusedon the success stories of three users who discovered how worthwhile it is tobuild systems from desktop and off-the-shelf components.andP;  Each userapproached the problems in different ways.andP;  But in all three cases, theresulting systems had a familiar look to them and produced excellent resultsand considerable savings.andM;The difference a year can make.andP;  Tamara Westmark, who had a strong effect onthe audience when she spoke at the Seybold Seminars last March (see theSeybold Report on Publishing Systems, Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  14, p. 10), gave anupdate on the work being done at Time Inc.andP;  In March, she told a successstory about a new system she had assembled (as an in-house project) for a newmagazine, Entertainment Weekly.andP;  This large Mac-based system is networked toprovide full pagination.andP;  Although it cost far less than a traditional vendorwould have charged, its price tag was still significant: slightly more than$1 million.andM;Westmark's next challenge was to duplicate this system's functionality forabout 10% of the price.andP;  How can you build a system one year later for 90%less?andP;  Obviously, the new system wasn't the same size--it was much smaller.andO;And because, unlike Entertainment Weekly's, this relatively sophisticated(but not necessarily complex) system would have no &quot;system manager&quot; to lookafter it, it was not networked.andP;  But the system was modular and, inWestmark's words, &quot;portable.&quot;andP;  It could easily be moved or duplicated formany other magazines.andM;This approach provided an excellent test bed for a trial magazine.andP;  Then,with a full commitment behind the magazine, the system would almost surely beextended, networked and brought closer to resembling the one being used dailyat Entertainment Weekly.andM;So in the long run, we found that systems aren't that much cheaper only oneyear later.andP;  But the experience gained in building a system using in-housestaff greatly reduced the time and effort needed to duplicate that task: theEntertainment Weekly system took about nine months to assemble, but theportable system took only two months.andP;  More important, these developmentsshow Time's willingness to continue in this direction, especially for newmagazines, where old equipment and old ways of doing things won't hamper theprogress of new thinking.andP;  Time is also excited about the &quot;recurring&quot; savingsprovided by the new systems, compared to the cost of producing a magazinewith third-generation equipment.andM;Separate but equally advantageous.andP;  On a different front, Marcel Coderch ofAnaya Systems echoed similar feelings about his home-grown system.andP;  Herecently designed a system for El Sol, a newspaper in Madrid, Spain (see theSeybold Report on Publishing Systems, Vol.andP;  20, No.andP;  1).andP;  Like Westmark, hebuilt his system from desktop components.andP;  But unlike Westmark's, his systemhad the support and backing of Anaya, a sister development company of El Sol.andM;Anaya brought system knowledge and expertise (but not developmentprogrammers) to the equation.andP;  The result is a very large, sophisticated andrelatively complex system--primarily Mac-based, with AppleShare running ondual Ethernet networks that are connected and bridged to multiple fileservers, peripherals and FastPath connections to LocalTalk devices.andM;The primary differences between the two systems are size and complexity.andO;There is more automated routing and file management in the El Sol system, andfinal output--including color--is handled directly within the system.andP;  Butthe components are very similar to what Westmark used on both of her TimeInc. systems, and the results are similar as well.andP;  Both companies areenjoying the fruits of having played &quot;system integrator,&quot; controlled theirown future and saved many thousands of dollars in the balance.andM;As Westmark found out, and Coderch concurred, however, big savings anddesktop solutions don't necessarily mean &quot;cheap systems.&quot;andP;  The El Sol systemcost in the range of $3 million (about a 40% premium over what it would havecost in the U.S.).andP;  One of Coderch's system support team members equated thisto a system costing upwards of $10 million in the U.S.andP;  for a similar sizeconfiguration, producing similar results on a product of similar size--butprovided by a traditional vendor.andP;  This view might have been a bitoptimistic, but the bottom line was consistent just the same: the fourth-wavesystem provides similar functionality (lesser in some cases, greater inothers) at considerable savings.andM;In addition, the future is brighter with an open system over which thecustomer has more control.andP;  And finally, as Westmark found, the savings onrecurring costs using newer systems of these types continue to besignificant.andM;Under budget, ahead of schedule.andP;  Don Skaggs of The Chronicle PublishingCompany was smiling for the same reasons, although he took a different pathto the same end.andP;  Not wanting to get involved with the integration taskhimself, he turned to an independent &quot;system integrator&quot; to assemble andinstall his system.andP;  CNI, his chosen integrator, used off-the-shelf desktopcomponents to build a new display ad makeup system at a fraction of the costof a traditional vendor's system.andP;  Don seemed more than pleased with hisfirst experiment in using independent integrators--a success story that isnow leading him toward using the same group to build a classified system (andeventually an editorial system) for his large daily newspaper in Worcester,Massachusetts, and several weeklies in the surrounding towns.andM;Don pointed to costs as the primary reason for looking to the desktop for hisreplacement (of a large traditional system).andP;  He wanted to save on theinitial purchase and installation as well as on recurring costs in the comingyears.andP;  So far, that is exactly what has happened.andP;  Best yet, he installedthe display ad system &quot;under budget and two weeks ahead of schedule,&quot;something he thought was unheard of in today's newspaper industry.andM;GoldStar has priced the software at $2,125.andP;  We doubt that anyone would buythe package we saw when they could get FrameMaker for their Unixworkstations, but with the Korean-language functionality restored, it mayhave some use.andM;Quark goes multi-platform, multiuserandM;Quark announced two directions for future development efforts.andP;  One ismultiuser functionality.andP;  Without giving any details, Quark founder Tim Gillsaid that future versions of Xpress would have features that support accessto documents by multiple users.andP;  But Gill also said that Quark would relyheavily on third parties to provide the specialized functions needed forspecific niches, rather than trying to do everything by itself.andM;The other direction is porting Xpress to Windows, Next and OS/2, in thatorder.andP;  The Windows 3.0 version, to be called QuarkXpress/PC, will probablyenter the market sometime in the third quarter of 1991.andP;  The Next versionwill follow, though no schedule has been announced.andM;In addition, Quark said it would develop versions of Xpress/PC for IBM's PS/2line (to run under OS/2) and the RS/6000.andP;  It also promised software to&quot;enhance integration and connectivity of multiple vendor systems.&quot;andM;Freebies 3.0.andP;  Recently, Quark issued several Xtensions in a package calledFreebies 3.0.andP;  The new functions include:andM;* Make fraction, make price.andP;  These two Xtensions format selected text.andO;There is also a Preferences dialog that lets you customize the appliedformatting.andM;* PostScript output.andP;  You can select either ASCII or binary format forPostScript images.andM;* Value converter.andP;  Enter a value in one measurement system and see it in allthe others: inches, picas, points, ciceros, cm and mm.andM;* Wordspace tracking.andP;  Quark's normal tracking applies equally to charactersand spaces.andP;  The new function adjusts spacing at word breaks only.andM;* Remove manual kerning deletes all kerning commands in a range of selectedtext.andM;The modules will be posted on popular bulletin boards and will be mailed toall Xpress users covered by an extended warranty.andP;  Quark will send it toother users, but will charge a $25 handling fee.andM;Ragtime ships version 3 in U.S.andM;Ragtime, the Macintosh program that has jazzed up the European scene withsome notable market success, has acted more like a dirge in its severalefforts to crack the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  But, with a &quot;never say die&quot; attitude, itis back for another try on this side of the Great Pond.andM;Copies of version 3 have been delivered to U.S.andP;  customers--to the extentthat orders have been received.andP;  Therein lies the hitch.andP;  Is the marketreacting any better this time around?andM;Although version 3 was demonstrated in beta form at Macworld in August 1989,the product probably hasn't been given a fair chance yet.andP;  The distributionchannels in the U.S.andP;  have been chaotic for much of the last couple of years.andO;We hope that the current distributor, Ragtime USA, will have more success.andM;We have always liked the product.andP;  Our European editor still uses theoriginal version for most of his office work in preference to other programsof all types--PageMaker, Xpress, Word, WriteNow, etc.andP;  One of the reasons, ofcourse, is that, as we have noted on many occasions, Ragtime attempts to be acomplete, all-purpose office product.andM;It incorporates desktop publishing, word processing, spreadsheet functions,graphics and charts into one program.andP;  It even supports full 24-bit color and12 languages for both hyphenation and spelling--although it still doesn'ttranslate our European editor's British English into the form we need forthis publication.andM;The other side of the coin is that it lacks some of the quality-orientedtools (such as kerning and fractional point sizes) that are now in mostdesktop publishing programs.andM;Countering these weaknesses is a great strength in integration of variouselements into one program, including dynamic linking between any combinationof frames.andP;  This allows automatic updating of text, illustrations orspreadsheets when an original is updated.andP;  For many people, the program willprovide all their needs in areas of word processing, spreadsheet, businessgraphics and desktop publishing.andM;For example, the spreadsheet may be able to handle tabular setting, which isbetter than the tabular functions of many of the other programs.andP;  One canalso directly create business graphics from the spreadsheet and build themautomatically into a publishable page.andP;  The business graphic willautomatically be updated when the spreadsheet is updated, without having tobe imported into a page layout program.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
