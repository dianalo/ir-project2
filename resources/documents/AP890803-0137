The Labor Department said non-farm productivity rose at aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.2 percent in the April-Juneperiod as output climbed 1.7 percent and hours worked by just 1.5percent.   That was an improvement over the revised 1.3 percent decline innon-farm productivity at an annual rate reported for the firstthree months of the year.   Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in thesecond quarter, the government said, down from a 6.2 percent gainin the first three months of the year but still a significantincrease that ultimately translates into higher prices.   Merrill Lynch's Bruce Steinberg said persistent wage gains wouldlimit overall inflation declines.   ``I think the inflation environment is looking somewhat betterthan it had been, but this is a cautionary note,'' he said.   Despite the wage gains _ hourly compensation rose at a 5.5percent annual rate in the April-June quarter _ American workersstill saw their buying power erode. Real wages _ compensation gainsminus the toll of consumer inflation _ fell at an annual rate of0.9 percent in the second quarter, the government said.   ``In some ways we're in the worst of both worlds now,'' saidchief economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill. ``The worker isseeing wages go up less than inflation and the manufacturer isseeing employment costs going up more than prices because of wagegains and the explosion of fringe benefit costs.''   Analysts said the declines or only modest productivity gains inrecent quarters were consistent with an economy nearing the end ofan expansion but said they were not necessarily a harbinger ofrecession.   Improved productivity _ the output per hour of all workers _ isconsidered vital to sustaining economic growth at times ofnear-full employment.   With the current slowdown in the economy, productivity gains ordeclines also will have a large effect on business profits becauseuncertainty about the economy has left many businesses,particularly in manufacturing, reluctant to hire new workers as ameans of improving output.   The report issued Thursday was based on preliminary data thatgenerally are revised in a more comprehensive report issued a monthlater.   Manufacturing workers posted a significant gain in productivityin the second quarter _ 2.4 percent at an annual rate _ but thatfigure was influenced by a 0.3 percent drop in total hours worked,another sign of the slowing economy.   Inflation's toll was even more pronounced on manufacturingworkers, whose hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 2.5percent in the second quarter while consumer inflation increasedmore than 6 percent _ meaning real wages paid manufacturing workersfell at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the latest quarter.   The report also included revised productivity data for the years1986 through 1988 showing productivity growth was slightly betterthan originally believed, rising by 2 percent in 1986, 1.1 percentin 1987 and 2.1 percent in 1988. Earlier data had put the increasesin those years at 2.0 percent, 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent,respectively.   The Bush administration, which had been criticized for usingunrealistic productivity estimates for its economic forecasts, tooksatisfaction in the upward revision.   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of EconomicAdvisers, said that the administration was ``quite pleased thatnon-farm productivity growth for 1986-88 was revised to a ratealmost exactly in line with our current thinking about theeconomy's long run growth potential.''</TEXT></DOC>
