(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   No one quite knows why a Democrat with noties to George Bush got invited to his Jan. 20 inauguration, but thelucky lady says she's putting the gift tickets in her pocket andheading for the festivities.   Mary Campbell, a former Democratic member of the Clover TownCouncil, got the unasked-for tickets in the mail last month.   It's only a guess, but her name may have something to do with themystery.   Gov. Carroll Campbell and President-elect Bush, both Republicans,are friends and political allies.   Campbell, who is going to the inauguration, asked that his sisterMary, who lives in Rock Hill, be mailed tickets as well.   The sister, whose married name is Mary Carpenter, didn't get thetickets. So the governor called for replacements for her.   Tony Denny, executive director of the state Republican Party,said he didn't know of any mix-up, but that Mary Campbell of Cloveris free to keep her tickets.   ``Of course she is,'' he said. ``I don't know her, but I hope shehas a great time.''   ``I have no idea how I got an invitation, and I'm not trying tofind out,'' Mrs. Campbell said. ``I am thrilled to be going and Ican't wait.''</TEXT><DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A team of wool wizards clipped, spun andwove their way to victory turning a sheep's wool into a shawl in 107minutes using techniques artisans used centuries ago.   ``We have a good team, everybody worked well together,''breathless team captain Carolyn Peyser said Wednesday night when thejudges announced the winner in the Pennsylvania Farm Show's Sheep toShawl contest.   After buying the shawl for $1,600, Darryl Breniser of Blue Ball,said the approximately 2-by-5 foot shawl was worth the money.   ``It was a fair price,'' he said. ``They worked hard for it.''   The team earned about $14.95 per minute of work on the shawl.   The Wool Wizards of Dauphin County beat out eight other teams offive.   The contest began when nine shearers armed with snapping electricrazors unceremoniously hauled a sheep between their legs, waited forthe starting signal and began shaving the animal bald. Chris Herr,shearer for the winning Wool Wizards, finished his sheep first inabout 2{ minutes.   The workers then carded the wool, brushing it with paddles so thefibers lay in one direction, worked it into yarn on a spinningwheel, and finally wove it into a shawl on a wooden frame loom.</TEXT><DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A billboard featuring a punk ``toothfairy'' has been put up by an artist who proposes building a hugemolar in the Grand River to honor the first city to fluoridate itsdrinking water.   The $550 billboard, put up Tuesday night, seeks support for``Operation: Pearly White,'' of a proposed 600-pound, 18-foot-longabstract sculpture of a fiberglass tooth balanced atop a stainlesssteel pole 22 feet above the river, near downtown.   Mark Heckman proposed his sculpture in June.   But the West Michigan Dental Society objects to the sculpture,contending a symbol of an extracted tooth may perpetuate stereotypeslinking dentistry to pain.   ``The billboard's got a big-time wrestler'' posing as the toothfairy, Heckman said. ``He's got pink, spiked hair with a big whitetooth earring. He's a bad dude, 6-3, 230 pounds solid. The billboardsays `Tooth or Consequences' and says `Support Operation: PearlyWhite.'''   Heckman said Wednesday he's raising money for his sculpture, butwouldn't say how much. The billboard will be in place for 10 days totwo weeks, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
