<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-59-0172 </DOCNO><TEXT>The surface crystallography of arsenic covered Si(001) has been analyzedby low-energy neutral impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy (NICISS).The 170{sup 0} backscattered He neutrals and ions have been detectedby a time-of-flight technique. The measured data show two well-time-resolvedlines for He scattered at Si and As atoms, respectively. Hence NICISSangular pattern for Si and As could be measured simultaneously. Adsorptionof arsenic lifts the original 1 x 2 reconstruction of the Si(001) substrateand forms itself a 1 x 2 As overlayer. The As overlayer is well describedby a dimer arrangement with an interatomic distance of 2.55 A of theAs dimers. From the ion scattering experiment considerable thermal vibrationsof the As atoms in the overlayer have been concluded. Best agreementwith Monte Carlo trajectory calculations is obtained for a Debye temperatureof 120 K.</TEXT></DOC>
