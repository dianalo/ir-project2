A number of methods have been developed toreduce emissions of these pollutants. Most processes are designed primarilyto remove SO{sub 2}, which is usually present in higher concentrationsthan NO/sub x/ and easier to remove. A method to simultaneously removeSO{sub 2} and NO/sub x/ is desirable. However, many simultaneous desulfurizationand denitrification processes are oxygen sensitive, and require a regenerationstep to reactive the material used. They have found that a class of oxidizingcompounds is capable of removing significant amounts of sulfur dioxideand nitrogen oxides from simulated flue gas. Since the compounds areoxidants, oxygen has essentially no effect on absorption capacity. Thecompounds have been tested in both a wet scrubbing system and a spraydrying system. The chemistry of this system is described in detail andthe scrubbing solution preparation and reaction products are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
