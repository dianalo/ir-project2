Premier Jacques Chirac hinted thatFrance might restore diplomatic relations with Tehran.   Diplomats Marcel Carton, 62, Marcel Fontaine, 45, and journalistJean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, arrived at the military airport ofVillacoublay outside Paris in a government jet.   Iran said its intervention brought about the release of thethree. Tehran Television, monitored in Cyrpus, quoted Ali RezaMoayyeri, a deputy prime minister for political affairs, as sayingIran interceded ``for humanitarian reasons.''   French goverment officials denied they paid ransom for thehostages' release. Comment abroad, however, ranged from dubious toscathing. Complaints from Britain and elsewhere accused France ofdealing with terrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostage.   Fontaine said his cellmate was Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press.   ``We survived,'' he told a reporter from French television'sChannel 5. ``I passed the time playing dominoes and chess with mycellmate.''   Asked who his companion was, Fontaine replied, ``The American,Terry Anderson.''   Anderson, 40, is the longest held of the remaining hostages. Hewas kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Carton, Fontaine and Kauffmann appeared ashen and shaky as theywalked slowly down the airplane steps on arrival in Paris.   Kauffmann drew back uncertainly when his 13-year-old son,Alexander, approached him. Then, when he recognized him, Kauffmannexpressed delight at how much the boy had grown.   Alexander's eyes filled with tears as he put his hands on hisfather's shoulders and looked him at him silently.   ``As we all know, the liberation of our hostages falls into theframework of our relations with Iran,'' said Chirac, who greetedthe men at the airport. ``It's the authorities in Tehran whointervened with the captors so that they would free ourcountrymen.''   France and Iran broke diplomatic relations July 17 after anIranian Embassy employee, Wahid Gordji, refused to submit toquestioning about bombings in Paris in September 1986. Gordji wasallowed to leave Paris two days after two French hostages werefreed in Beirut.   ``It's an incredible day,'' Kauffmann told reporters. ``But it'salso a day which remains overshadowed because we are just three.''   The journalist for the weekly magazine L'Evenement de Jeudi saidearlier that Michel Seurat, the 39-year-old researcher capturedwith him on May 22, 1985, probably died of cancer, rather thanhaving been executed, as claimed by the kidnappers.   Carton and Fontaine were kidnapped March 22, 1985.   Kauffman praised Seurat's courage and said Seurat encouraged hiscompanions during his early days in captivity. ``That he could die,all alone, after contributing so much, is awful. I cannot forget,''he said.   ``I'm a little ashamed to be here today,'' he said, recallingthe other Western hostages, including nine Americans, held inLebanon and leading what he called ``that nightmare life.''   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said she was encouraged by thereleases. She said she planned to ask the freed French hostages``what Terry is thinking and dreaming about, what his hopes are.How he's surviving.''   She spoke in a telephone interview with The Associated Pressfrom her home in Batavia, N.Y.   The former hostages were taken to the Val-de-Grace militaryhospital in southern Paris for two days of observation and werevisited by President Francois Mitterrand.   At the airport, Chirac thanked a ``friend of France and Iran,''but provided no details. Political observers said he was referringto Algeria, which was believed to have played a key role in thehostage negotiations.   The premier also thanked Syrian President Hafez Assad andLebanese military authorities.   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua supervised the negotiations.   Reports in Paris and Beirut said that in exchange for the threeFrenchmen, France agreed to pay the outstanding balance on a loanoriginally totaling $1 billion made by the late Shah Mohammad RezaPahlavi.   ABC News reported that France's mediator was Iranian businessmanManucher Ghorbanifar, who was involved in the U.S.arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.   The station also said France agreed to repay the rest of theloan in food and other non-lethal supplies and re-establishrelations with Iran. It said Iran agreed there will be no furtherterrorist attacks against France.   Radio France Internationale, citing unidentified diplomaticsources, said the French government will sign a check for $400million in the next few days, the third repayment on the loan. Twoother payments of $330 million and $300 million have already beenmade, the radio reported.   On Nov. 11, 1986, six days before France agreed to the $330million payment, pro-Iranian extremists released two Frenchhostages. On Dec. 24, another hostage was released.   A total of 10 French hostages have been freed since Chirac'sgovernment took office in March 1986.   The latest release occurred just four days before Chirac'spresidential runoff against Mitterand, a Socialist who was favoredto win a second term.   In Washington, the Reagan administration said Thursday it hopedno deals were made for the freedom of the three Frenchmen.   Asked whether France had paid a ransom, Pasqua said: ``We havenot accorded any funds of any sort to anyone, not a franc, not adollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''</TEXT></DOC>
