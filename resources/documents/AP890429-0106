As campus and city police led John A. Davies, the South Africanconsul in New York, off the school's campus Friday, protestersformed a gantlet and yelled, ``Don't come back!'' and ``Racist!''   Students drummed their fists on the city police car that tookDavies away, breaking windows on the vehicle but causing noinjuries, detectives said.   Davies was on campus to give a speech, but the demonstrationforced him to cancel his appearance.   Davies, escorted by guards, had walked into the elevator beforethe talk, but was stalled there with the elevator's doors open formore than 20 minutes in front of hundreds of angry demonstrators.Security guards and police stood between Davies and the protesters.   Davies appeared upset by the experience, said Kostas Markou, aTemple senior and native of Greece who was also in the elevator.   ``He was shaking,'' Markou said. ``I said to him, `You mustknow, I am Greek and the whole world does not like yourgovernment.'''   Police and school officials said it was not clear whether theelevator was not working or whether protesters had sabotaged it.   Students said they were pleased that Davies' talk was canceled.   ``Why should we allow him to speak when our brothers and sistersare not allowed to walk into another town (in South Africa)?'' saidTaneshia Nash, a black protester.   Davies said later he had planned to discuss the need forstability in South Africa so reform efforts could work. He saidblacks would lose their jobs and progress would be slowed ifeconomic sanctions were put into effect.   ``I am frustrated,'' Davies said. ``I had been misled intothinking there would not be any trouble.''   University administrators said they were surprised at theprotest, occurring on the final day of spring semester classes.   H. Patrick Swygert, vice president for administration, denouncedthe protest of Davies' talk, which was arranged by the chairman ofthe university's department of political science.   ``It is the right of the professor to invite anyone who hethinks is representative of a point of view,'' Swygert said. ``Itwould be a terrible precedent for this or any other university tocensor that access.''   Davies was in Philadelphia for a meeting of the American Academyof Political and Social Science. He said he had spoken at Lehighand Princeton universities and that his speeches there weredelivered without protests, although his views were challenged.</TEXT></DOC>
