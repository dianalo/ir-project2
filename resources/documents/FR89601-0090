The staff has concluded from this evaluation that reactor operationwith the proposed MAPLHGR extension is acceptable in that: (1) The thermaland mechanical considerations for increasing MAPLHGR to the 45,000 MWd/MTUlimit were calculated using conservative NRC-approved methodology; (2)the licensee's analytical results showed that the fuel peak clad temperatureis less than 1 percent under loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA) conditions;and (3) the proposed exposure increase (8.3 kW/ft at 45,000 MWd/MTU) meetsthe requirements set forth in 10 CFR 50.46 of the Commission's regulations.The proposed amendment will have no adverse effect on the probability ofany accident; does not involve any increase in fuel burnup rate or changethe mix of fission products that might be released in the event of seriousaccident; and thus will not significantly affect the consequences of seriousaccidents. No changes are being made in the types or amounts of any radiologicaleffluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increasein the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts of reactor operation withthe requested MAPLHGR increase, the proposed change involves systems locatedwithin the restricted area, as defined in 10 CFR Part 20 of the Commission'sregulations. The proposed change does not affect nonradiological planteffluents and has no other environmental impact.The ``Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunityfor Hearing'' in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 22, 1989 (54 FR 7621). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following publicationof this notice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission has concluded there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternative withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to the operation of the MonticelloNuclear Generating Plant, dated, November 1972.Agencies and Persons ContactedThe Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the applicationfor amendment dated January 31, 1989 and supplement thereto dated February3, 1989, which are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC,and at the Minneapolis Public Library, Technology and Science Department300 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 25th day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence Yandell,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director, Project Directorate III-1, Division of Reactor Projects_III,IV, V andamp; Special Projects, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-12995 Filed 5-31-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7590-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
