High temperature materials, composites, polymeric materialsand glass ceramics received wide coverage. Processing, microstructuraldetermination and applications of these new materials are discussed.Seven papers are concerned with high temperature engineering ceramics,five papers concern composite materials. Other sessions covered joiningof materials (2 papers), properties of polymeric materials (3 papers),glass ceramics (3 papers), structural ceramics (1 papers) and processingtechniques (4 papers). One of the papers on polymers, on the predictionof service lifetimes of elastomer seals under radiation conditions, isindexed spearately. There are three papers covering general aspects ofnew materials and seven covering electrical and magnetic properties ofnew materials. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
