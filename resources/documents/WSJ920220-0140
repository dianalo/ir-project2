The feat showed that a trick called frequency doublingmight be used to get high-powered, high-quality beams ofvarious colors of light from a solid-state laser. The powerand quality of the beams could lead to new applications ofsolid-state lasers in medicine, communications andmanufacturing, the company said.</LP><TEXT>   Powerful beams of green light have been producedpreviously, but by gas lasers, explained Michael H.McLaughlin, manager of laser technology at GE's big researchand development center here. Solid-state lasers have theadvantage of being smaller and more compact and thus moreamenable to various applications. But until now, beams ofgreen light from solid-state lasers have been relatively weakand there have been some questions of whether it is possibleto use the frequency-doubling trick to produce high-poweredbeams of light from solid-state lasers.   To get a powerful beam of green light, the GE researcherssaid they started with a 16-watt beam of invisible infraredlight from a solid-state laser. The beam was fed into aso-called face-pumped laser that pumped up the power of thebeam to 92 watts.   In the next step, the 92-watt beam was focused on acrystal of lithium triborate which doubled the frequency ofpart of the beam, jumping it into the green part of the lightspectrum from the infrared. The power of the green beam was52 watts, or twice as powerful as green beams previouslyproduced by solid-state lasers, GE said. Moreover, the greenbeam was of &quot;good quality,&quot; meaning it tended to stay narrowand steady.   Green light is easily absorbed by certain plasticcomposites and thus the more powerful beam might be useful inmachining such composites, the company said. Green light alsopasses easily through seawater and thus such lasers might beuseful for submarine communications.   &quot;With additional frequency conversions, we can shift thegreen beam to wavelengths in the ultraviolet and deepultraviolet regions useful for laser surgery and othermedical applications while retaining substantial averagepower,&quot; Mr. McLaughlin said.</TEXT></DOC>
