(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Caroline HallidayandM;When the task is to input small images  or small amounts of text into a PC,an ideal  solution lies directly in the buyer's hand --  the hand-heldscanner.andM;Because of their limitations, these devices  are not a suitable replacementfor full-page desktop scanners.andP;  Most hand-held scanners  can scan only a bitmore than 4 inches in  width in a single pass, although large images  can bepieced together with multiple scans.andM;Also, because  most hand-held  scanners are manually dragged  across theimage  being scanned, image quality depends on how the  user moves the scanner -- the  smoother and straighter the movement, the better the  qualityof the resulting scanned image.andM;If buyers are not concerned with these  limitations, however, and need toscan only  a small amount of text or images for each  job, hand-held scanners-- costing as little as  $250 -- can serve as a low-cost alternative to their desktop kin -- costing $1,000 and  more -- as well as to outside artservices.andM;According to Fred Maia, marketing director at Designer Accents Inc., animporter and distributor of artificial flowers in  Dallas, the NISCANhand-held scanner  from NISCA Inc., of Carrollton, Texas, has  saved hiscompany the expense of using  outside services to create promotionalmaterials.andM;&quot;I used to take material to an art service  at $50 an hour,&quot; said Maia.andP;  &quot;Nowwe do a 3- by-3-inch [line] drawing, scan it with the  software that camewith the scanner, save  it to disk and import it into PageMaker as a  TIFFfile.&quot;andM;Creating Designer Accents' brochures  and order forms in-house saves thecompany time as well as money, he added.andM;&quot;Instead of having to get in line [for outside services], it can be done inthe same  day,&quot; said Maia.andM;Other typical applications for hand-held  scanners include scanning diagramsfor  financial reports, photographs for news  letters, logos for letterheadpaper and  numbers for spreadsheets.andM;Buyers should consider their particular  scanning needs before selecting ahand-held  scanner.andP;  Hand-held models that have optical character recognitionsoftware scan  text; some scan only graphics; and others  can scan both textand graphics.andM;While all hand-held graphics scanners  can scan line art, only some have agray- level setting.andP;  This setting allows them to  scan gray-scale imagessuch as drawings  and photographs.andM;In addition, a few new hand-held scanners, such as the JX-100 from SharpElectronics Corp. and the IBM Color Scanner- 2701 from Accel Computer Corp.,andO;allow  color images to be scanned.andM;Resolution is another feature to consider when purchasing a hand-heldscanner.andP;  A direct correlation exists between the  resolution of the inputdevice and that of  the output device: The quality of the output image cannotbe better than that of  the original scanned image.andM;For example, if an image is scanned at  100 dots per inch (dpi), the outputquality  cannot improve beyond that, even if printed  on a laser printer witha 300-dpi resolution.andM;Ensuring Quality OutputandM;Most hand-held scanners have resolutions that can be set at 200, 300 or 400dpi.andP;  Even the maximum 400-dpi level, however,  is not adequate fortypeset-quality images.andM;The quality of the final output can also  decrease if the scanned image ismodified  in graphics or desktop-publishing programs.andP;  For example, if ascanned image  file is placed into PageMaker as a graphics  image at twiceits original size, lines that  were smooth in the scanned image file may lookjagged when output because of  the size modifications.andM;Before making a purchase, buyers  should test the hand-held scanner they are considering by scanning an image typical  of their work and outputting theimage on  the printer they plan to use.andM;If the output quality is adequate, users  should next consider ease of use.andO;Because  the user moves the scanner's heads across  the image, the qualityobtained is directly  affected by the user.andM;Changes in speed during the scan, for example, may cause image distortion,and if  the scan is not straight, the image will be  skewed.andM;Many scanners have edge guides, handles  and wide rollers that encouragestraight,  smooth movements.andP;  Buyers should make  sure that any hand-heldscanner they are  considering includes these features.andM;Buyers should also consider the software that is bundled with the scanner.andO;All  scanners include software that accepts  the scanned data and puts itinto a usable  form.andP;  The quality and functionality of this  software,however, vary among scanners.andP;  Some manufacturers bundle additional  softwarethat can be used to modify the  scanned images.andM;According to Tom Bongiorno, national  marketing manager at Sharp Electronics in Mahwah, N.J., &quot;Sharp's position is to try  to provide not just scanningsoftware, but  software that can be used, such as Windows ColorLab 100.andM;&quot;The user also has to consider manipulating, editing, contrast and colorcorrection,&quot; he explained.andM;However, Barbara Wetherbee, product  marketing manager for The Complete PC Inc. in Milpitas, Calif., manufacturer of The  Complete Hand Scanner, saidthat the soft  ware included with a scanner doesn't have  to besophisticated, because most users will  be importing the scanned image toother application programs before final output.andM;&quot;It's important that the [scanner] software is easy to use and does basiccropping,  scaling and simple editing,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Users  almost alwaysimport [the scanned image]  into paint programs or word processors.andM;&quot;The goal is not to use the software that  comes with the scanner,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;However, we are seeing more bundling of [software] products [with thescanners].&quot;andM;----------Caroline Halliday is an electrical engineer specializing in technicaldocumentation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
