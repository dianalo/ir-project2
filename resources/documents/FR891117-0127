To further reflect the provisions of CDC's system security plans, thesafeguards information in a number of automated systems is being revised.A.

Access is granted to only a limited numberof physicians, scientists, statisticians, and designated support staffof the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or its contractors, as authorizedby the system manager to accomplish the stated purposes for which the datain this system have been collected.2. <T3>Physical Safeguards:</T3> Access to the CDC Clifton Road facility wherethe mainframe computer is located is controlled by a card key system. Accessto the computer room is controlled by a card key and security code (numerickeypad) system. Access to the data entry area is also controlled by a cardkey system. The hard copy records are kept in locked cabinets in lockedrooms. The local fire department is located directly across the streetfrom the Clifton Road buildings. The computer room is protected by an automaticsprinkler system, automatic sensors (e.g., water, heat, smoke, etc.) areinstalled, and portable fire extinguishers are located throughout the computerroom. The system is backed up on a nightly basis with copies of the filesstored off site in a secure fire proof safe. The 24-hour guard servicein buildings provides screening of visitors. Electronic anti-intrusiondevices are in effect at the Federal Records Center.3. <T3>Procedural safeguards:</T3> System security includes automatic suspensionof accounts, forced password changes, and control of systems and data setaccess. Protection for computerized records includes programmed verificationof valid user identification code, account code and password prior to acceptanceof a terminal session or job submission, frequently changed passwords,and Vault Management System. When Privacy Act tapes are erased, a special``certified'' process is performed in which tapes are completely writtenover to avoid inadvertent data disclosure. Additional safeguards may bebuilt into the program by the system analyst as warranted by the sensitivityof the data. CDC and contractor employees who maintain records are instructed to checkwith the system manager prior to making disclosures of data. When individuallyidentified data are being used in a room, admittance at either CDC or contractorsites is restricted to specifically authorized personnel. Privacy Act provisionsare included in contracts, and the CDC Project Director, contract officersand project officers oversee compliance with these requirements. Upon completionof the contract, all data will be either returned to CDC or destroyed,as specified by the contract.4. <T3>Implementation Guidelines:</T3> The safeguards outlined above are developedin accordance with Chapter 45-13, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systemsof Records,'' of the HHS General Administration Manual, supplementary ChapterPHS.hf: 45-13; Part 6, ``Automated Information System Security,'' of theHHS Information Resources Management Manual; the National Bureau of StandardsFederal Information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31).FRC safeguards are in compliance with GSA Federal Property Management Regulations,Subchapter B_Archives and Records.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>B.

Hard copy records arekept in locked cabinets in locked rooms. Access to the computer room iscontrolled by a punch lock system. System print-outs are made availableto the requester through the use of ``pigeon-hole'' mailboxes which areindividually secured by (combination) locking doors. The local fire departmentis one mile from the facility, which is of structural steel and cementblock construction, with pre-cast cement panels on the envelope. No combustiblematerials are used in the building construction, including all interiorwalls. The computer room is protected by a Halon gas, built-in extinguishersystem. Heat sensors are installed, and portable fire extinguishers arelocated throughout the computer room. The active system files are backedup on a weekly basis. The entire system is backed up, with copies of thefiles stored in a secure, fireproof safe in a separate location withinthe facility.3. <T3>Procedural safeguards:</T3> System security includes automatic suspensionof accounts, forced password changes, and control of systems and data setaccess.
