The possible sale of the businesses is the latest sign ofa new urgency among IBM executives to make each businessstand on its own to strengthen the company's financialperformance.</LP><TEXT>   As part of a cost-cutting campaign, the computer giant hasbeen looking for ways to get out of marginal businesses andhas simply decided that it can't make some of theselow-profit-margin items as inexpensively as its competitorscan, the executives said. In addition, these businesses areno longer central to IBM. While electric typewriters, forexample, were once a mainstay of IBM's office equipmentbusiness, they were supplanted in the 1980s by theproliferation of desktop computers and other word processingsystems.   In composite trading yesterday on the New York StockExchange, IBM closed at $120.75, down $1.625.   In Armonk, N.Y., an IBM spokesman declined to comment. Theindustry executives cautioned that many details remain to beworked out before a sale can be completed. Still, they saidthat IBM is talking with a potential buyer, and that anagreement may be announced by the end of this month. Thepossible buyer's identity couldn't be confirmed.   The current plan provides for a leveraged buy-out, withsome employees getting equity -- an arrangement that, whilecommonplace in the 1980s, would be unusual for a businessowned by IBM.   A leveraged buy-out also would raise some troubling issuesfor IBM, because such transactions are sometimes followed bylayoffs to cut costs and help enable the acquirer to repaythe debt used in the purchase. Yet a key tenet of IBM'sculture is a tradition of no layoffs. When IBM has soldbusinesses in the past, it has tried to allay employee fearson that subject, and IBM's concerns about employee morale areapparently part of what remains to be worked out.   Besides typewriters and keyboards, the computer industryexecutives said, the sale also could involve low-endprinters. All three products are made at IBM's plant inLexington, Ky. The number of employees there wasn'tavailable. IBM has already turned over much of its typewritermarketing and service to other companies. It also backed awayfrom a similar business, copiers, by selling most of theoperations to Eastman Kodak Co. two years ago.   The move would be embarrassing for IBM, because it spentseveral hundred million dollars a few years ago to modernizeand automate the Lexington facility, and touted it as anexample of how a U.S. manufacturing facility could competewith the Japanese.   Still, IBM executives have indicated they will bite thebullet, if they must, to cut costs. In the fourth quarter,IBM took a $2.4 billion charge to cover a reduction of 10,000jobs and some plant consolidations. It also has been pruningoperations where possible; just last week, it said it wasselling its automated teller machine operations into a jointventure with Diebold Inc., after capturing only about 5% ofthe worldwide market.   A Wall Street source said IBM is being advised on the saleby Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the securities unit ofAmerican Express Co. Advisers for the potential buyer arebelieved to include the investment banking unit of J.P.Morgan andamp; Co., as well as the Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. unit ofGeneral Electric Co.   Executives of Shearson, Morgan and Kidder all declined tocomment.   Any sale of these typewriter, keyboard or printerbusinesses would underscore IBM's intention to get out ofmarginal businesses, because, while IBM has sold assets itbuilt up in ventures with other companies, it rarely partswith home-grown businesses such as these.   IBM's business as a whole has performed better thanexpected this year, with earnings up 6.8% in the first halfto $2.45 billion, or $4.26 a share, on a revenue rise of 9.8%to $30.68 billion. But IBM isn't out of the woods yet.   Sales of mainframes declined in the second quarter, andIBM must manage a ticklish transition late this year and nextyear, as it moves to a new generation of mainframes that thecompany is expected to announce this fall. Customers oftenstop buying products while they pause to evaluate new ones,creating an awkward slowdown in sales.   IBM's mainframe competitors also have been taking marketshare away from the company in the past couple of years, andsome industry executives worry that the new generation ofmachines expected from Amdahl Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. mayaccelerate that erosion of market share. Mainframes accountfor roughly half of IBM's sales and nearly two-thirds of itsearnings, so any problems in that area would ripple throughIBM's business.   Even while announcing solid earnings on Monday, IBMChairman John Akers cautioned in a statement that &quot;muchremains to be done this year.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
