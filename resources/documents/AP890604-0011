The one exception to the news blackout on civilian casualtieswas a maverick announcer for Radio Beijing's English-languageservice, who reported that troops firing indiscriminately hadkilled thousands of people, mostly innocent civilians.   The unidentified announcer, in a broadcast monitored inWashington, asked listeners to protest ``the most barbaroussuppression of the people.'' He was later replaced by anotherannouncer repeating the government line.   That line was that the military attack on the city, during whichhundreds of people were killed, had ``suppressed acounterrevolutionary riot'' and was a ``great victory in thestruggle to end turmoil in the capital.''   Announcers on national television, reading from editorials inthe official Liberation Army Daily and Xinhua News Agency, blamedthe violence on a ``gang of robbers ... bent on throwing the wholecountry into confusion.''   The army daily said the rioters attempted to ``beat up andkidnap army men, kill and injure our cadres and fighters, smash andburn military trucks, loot weapons and ammunition, storm (CommunistParty headquarters) and the Great Hall of the People, rob shops andburn down buildings.''   It said the riots exposed the plots of a few and their``sinister attempt to oppose the Communist Party's leadership andthe socialist system.''   Xinhua said three soldiers were killed and more than 1,000injured by ``thugs'' who burned and smashed 31 military trucks, 23police cars, two armored vehicles and 31 buses.   The official news agency also accused the independent studentunion and autonomous trade union that sprung up during theseven-week democratic movement of issuing butcher knives, daggers,iron chains and other weapons to people in Tiananmen Square.   The reports gave no casualty figures for civilians and did notmention that the army, breaking a government vow that troops wouldnot be used on student demonstrators, fired indiscriminately intocrowds.   The accounts were in sharp contrast to those of several weeksago, when Chinese journalists buoyed by the democracy movementenjoyed a brief moment of freedom to report objectively on theprotests. Many joined the movement for reforms and demanded a freerpress.   However, as party hardliners gained the edge in a power strugglesparked by the student unrest, the press quickly returned to itsrole as the propaganda medium for party policy.   The television broadcast, reading a notice from the Beijingmunicipal government, said soldiers and police ``strictly observeddiscipline'' and said ``their heroic acts and glorious exploitshave won fervent praise and strong support from the masses ofstudents and citizens.''</TEXT></DOC>
