If they are to be restricted to an apparentlybearable level, the consumption of fossil energy carriers must be reduced.This can be attained through a reduction in requirement and through increaseduse of non-fossil primary energy forms. Amongst these, nuclear energyand hydroelectricity are already available. Both nuclear energy and solarenergy are by human standards adequate and inexhaustible sources of energy,if thorium 232 and uranium 238 are used in high temperature and breederreactors and if the new techniques for the extensive use of solar energyare successfully developed. A possible structure for the future energysupply industry with a third of present-day carbon dioxide emissionsis presented for the example of the Federal Republic of Germany and fora global model. The change in structure must begin now, because laterthe rates of change needed would be unrealistically high from a technicaland economic point of view. Some apparently necessary and possible stepstowards this objective are indicated.</TEXT></DOC>
