Under a proposal drafted by the Association of BankHolding Companies, the industry would set up and finance afund that purchases preferred stock from banks needingcapital infusions. Officials at the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. are studying the plan, which they think could help headoff bank failures and reduce the drain on the bankdeposit-insurance fund.</LP><TEXT>   FDIC Chairman William Seidman made a vague reference tothe plan during testimony before the Senate Banking Committeeon the government's seizure of Bank of New England Corp. &quot;Weneed to explore ways to prevent failures, and we're activelypursuing this with the leadership of the banking industry,&quot;he said. &quot;The bankers have approached us to talk about earlyaction.&quot;   The proposal, which faces both economic and politicalhurdles, would be a way to ease strains on banks hurt by badreal estate loans at a time when many believe that banksshould be lending more to soften the recession. In recentdays, Mr. Seidman has spoken of an increasingly urgent needto provide more credit, particularly in New England, in orderto keep the recession as short and moderate as possible.   &quot;Clearly the banking industry is under stress,&quot; Mr.Seidman said, conceding that he expects more failures in theregion. He said that &quot;at this point we don't expect&quot; any moremajor bank failures there, &quot;but it depends on the economy.&quot;Bank of New England Corp., with assets of $23 billion, wasthe third-largest bank holding company in the six-state area.   &quot;We will work to try to break the credit crunch, becausethe credit crunch will&quot; increase troubles for the economy andfor banks, he said.   At hearings before the Senate panel in the morning and theHouse Banking Committee in the afternoon, Mr. Seidman andComptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke defended theirdecision to protect all deposits, even $2 billion in accountsbeyond the scope of federal deposit insurance, when theyclosed the Bank of New England Sunday.   &quot;A further loss of confidence in the banking system couldhave induced additional bank failures which would have costthe FDIC more than it would have saved by limiting coverageto insured deposits&quot; of $100,000 or less, Mr. Clarkeexplained.   Nevertheless, several members of the banking panelscomplained that decisions to protect all accounts in bigbanks but not in smaller banks is unfair. Several legislatorsproposed a change in the regulatory doctrine that holds thatit is too risky to allow some banks to fail.   The Bush administration, in a banking-overhaul proposal itexpects to release by the end of this month, plans to proposecurbs on the too-big-to-fail doctrine, and the chairmen ofboth the House and Senate Banking Committees have proposedtreating all banks equally. The changes would be phased inover time, along with higher capital requirements and newregulations designed to reduce the chances of bank failures.   One reason for restricting insurance coverage is to slowthe drain on the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund, which is fallingrapidly as more banks fail. The FDIC expects the fund, whichis financed by a 19.5-cent premium that banks pay on each$100 of deposits, to shrink to $4 billion by the end of thisyear from $9 billion at the end of 1990. The bankingindustry, in consultation with regulators, is working on aplan to bolster the fund. It is in this context that theAssociation of Bank Holding Companies has proposed a new fundto prop up solvent but inadequately capitalized banks.   Mr. Seidman has proposed a one-time banking industryassessment of 1% of deposits that would pump $25 billion intothe fund. But banks worry that such a cost increase wouldaccelerate falling bank profits and lead to further creditcontractions. Rather than pay all that money into a fund tobail out failed banks, the holding company association, whichrepresents the nation's biggest banks, proposed a two-partplan: Banks would pay small amounts into the bank insurancefund each year and create a second fund designed to keepbanks from failing in the first place.   &quot;We're talking about providing working capital so theydon't fail,&quot; said Thomas Ashley, the association's president.Mr. Ashley, a friend and Yale classmate of President Bush, isa former congressman.   As first presented, the fund would be controlled by thebanking industry, which also would decide which banks tosave. Because the fund would purchase preferred stock fromthe struggling banks, the money other banks contribute to thefund would earn interest and be treated as equity capital.When the bank recovered, it would pay back the fund andretire the stock.   By contrast, current premiums paid into the fund don'tearn interest and are deducted from income as an expense.   One of the issues the industry and the FDIC are discussingis the government's role in running the fund. &quot;There has tobe some kind of FDIC backstop, and that requires some kind ofFDIC control and participation,&quot; an agency official said.</TEXT></DOC>
