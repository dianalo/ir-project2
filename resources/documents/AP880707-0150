(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy had to destroy a Trident 2missile in flight Thursday night, the second failure in 13 testlaunchings of the new submarine-based missile, authorities said.   The 44-foot, $23.7-million missile, carrying a dummy warheadpackage, blazed away from a land launch pad at 6:38 p.m. EDT aftera flawless countdown and darted quickly into heavy clouds. But theNavy later issued a statement reporting a problem developed duringfirst-stage flight.   The range safety officer sent a radio signal 60 seconds afterliftoff to blow apart the missile so that pieces would fallharmlessly into the Atlantic Ocean and not threaten land, the Navysaid.   The statement said the cause of the malfunction could not bedetermined immediately.   The three-stage Trident 2 was to have hurled its warhead packageto an Atlantic Ocean target several thousand miles to thesoutheast. The weapon has a range of nearly 6,000 miles but itsintended range Thursday night was not disclosed.   The test was the 13th of 20 land pad launches planned here, tobe followed by at least five submarine launch tests. The weapon isscheduled to become operational late next year.   The test program began in January 1987 and reeled off ninestraight successes before logging a failure last January. It hadrecorded two more successes before Thursday night's malfunction.   Each Trident 2 is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads todifferent targets. There are to be 24 of the weapons aboard each ofnine planned Trident submarines.</TEXT></DOC>
