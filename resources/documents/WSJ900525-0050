The ruling is unlikely to be the last word in a runningdispute between CMS and Michigan officials, both parties saidyesterday. CMS wants to use the assets to expand itsunregulated energy businesses and to buy back stock. Stateregulators say the assets should be used only to improve thefinancial footing of its regulated utility subsidiary,Consumers Power Co.</LP><TEXT>   Conflicting rulings have sent CMS's stock on a rollercoaster ride. It plunged $2.375, to $28.625 a share, afterWednesday's order by the Michigan Public Service Commissionprohibiting the transfer. The stock eased yesterday morning,but after word of the appeals court decision reached themarkets, CMS shares recovered to close at $29.125 each, up 50cents, in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading.   CMS Energy officials said that because of the likelihoodof further litigation, they have put on hold their plans tospend the $1.5 billion.   Consumers Power received $1.2 billion in interest-bearingnotes and a $341 million equity stake last month from itspartners in the Midland Cogeneration Venture. Thecogeneration venture is a once-failed nuclear-power plant nowconverted to a gas-fired cogeneration facility.   The public service commission's order said the notescouldn't be transferred from Consumers Power to CMS Energy,but instead Consumers Power must use the funds, &quot;in ways thatwill secure {Consumers Power's} financial health.&quot;   But a three-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appealsin Lansing said the utility regulators didn't have theauthority to set such limitations. State officials said theyhaven't decided on their next move, but still believe theyhave authority to restrict allocation of the funds.   Although the appeals-court ruling clearly is in CMS'sfavor, company officials said the prospects of furtherlitigation mean shareholders won't soon gain the benefits ofthe $1.2 billion in notes.   &quot;There's still some other shoes to fall,&quot; said John W.Clark, a CMS senior vice president. &quot;There's still the issueof who's running this company. Lansing {where stateregulators are} or Dearborn,&quot; where CMS's headquarters islocated.   State regulators contend Consumers Power concededoversight authority for the $1.5 billion in 1985 when thecompany was on the verge of bankruptcy after sinking $4.1billion into the failed Midland nuclear-power venture. Inreturn for a special rate increase to ease its financialproblems, CMS agreed to allow the public service commissionto control the use of any proceeds derived from the sale ofthe failed power plant's assets.   CMS officials contend they have fulfilled the state'srequirements by getting Consumers Power back on soundfinancial footing and by retiring $1.9 billion in debt. Anyfurther extension of state authority is meddling, CMSexecutives say.</TEXT></DOC>
