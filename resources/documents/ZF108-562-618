 Every action, from creatinga query through defining a report, follows a trail of pull-down menus,dialogue boxes, check boxes, fill-in-the-blank fields and radio buttons.andO;However, some shortcuts, including shorthand keys and the ability to enterSQL query text directly, are available.andM;For the user, this interface pays off most in simplicity and consistency.andO;The Query Manager's constant supply of defaults and helpful prompts as wellas an excellent context-sensitive on-line help facility make it easy fornovices to assemble forms and reports.andP;  A 94-page Query Manager tutorial inthe OS/2 Getting Started manual augments the many examples and tutorials inthe Database Manager manual, so most users should have no trouble gettingstarted with the Query Manager.andM;By using the same interface tools in all of its components, the Query Manageralso gives the feel of a consistent, cohesive whole, unlike the verydifferent modules of Gupta Technologies' SQLWindows.andM;The dialogue boxes present information and prompts in necessarily small,discrete chunks, which can make programmers long for a full-page display ofoptions and some relief from the almost constant mouse-clicking.andP;  A productthat is so well-designed for novices should also appeal to seasonedprogrammers; there should be a way for programmers to fill in a full screenof options at one time.andM;In the database arena, friendly interfaces are often associated withrelatively low-power products.andP;  Not so with the Query Manager, which offers abroad range of report-writing and forms-creation tools.andM;However, the Query Manager is unnecessarily obscure in its terminology.andP;  Intypical IBM fashion, this product uses a major industry-standard term,&quot;form,&quot; in a non-standard way.andP;  To the Query Manager, a form is the set ofpop-up windows used to define a report.andP;  The manuals refer often to a&quot;query-form-report&quot; triangle, in which a query defines the data and a formdefines the layout and other options for a report.andP;  What other vendors wouldcall a form, the Query Manager refers to as a &quot;panel.&quot; This kind ofterminology change is senseless and one that IBM should abandon.andM;Also senseless are a few of the restrictions of the forms (in the usualsense) and the reports that the Query Manager can create.andP;  While many PCproducts let users edit data in tabular displays, the Query Manager maintainsthe traditional distinction between reports (which are passive and can onlydisplay data) and forms (which allow data-entry, update and deletionfunctions).andM;Worse still, while forms, like reports, support full query-by-examplequeries, they permit only forward movement through the queried data.andP;  Theform menus lack any option for moving backward.andP;  Typically, relationaldatabases sequentially return the records resulting from a query, and areunable to recall a record.andP;  The Query Manager needlessly passes thislimitation on to the user.andP;  A buffer containing data from the previously readrecords, along with some code to re-establish consistency with the databaseshould the user try to change a passed record, would have hidden this problemfrom the user, as Gupta's SQLWindows did.andM;In true Blue fashion, the Database Manager has severe limits to the number offile formats it can directly import and export.andP;  It can handle the ASCII,1-2-3 and Symphony formats, but lacks any support for the dBASE files thathouse so much of the existing PC-based data files.andP;  dBASE users, though, canmove data into Database Manager databases using intermediate delimited ASCIIfiles.andM;The Database Manager does include a utility that lets users exchange datawith IBM's mainframe SQL database systems, DB2 and SQL/DS.andM;The Query Manager sections of the main Database Manager manual are clear andcomplete, with a great deal of tutorial information and step-by-stepinstructions.andP;  A quick-reference section, perhaps with a full menu map, wouldbe a nice addition, but the more than 400-page manual is generally easy toread and use.andM;IBM can be reached in White Plains, N.Y., at (800) 426-2468.andM;SQL-based database servers bring large-system database technology anddevelopment tools to PCs.andP;  Unfortunately, they also have big-time processorand RAM requirements.andM;The RAM requirements of IBM's Database Manager depend on the system: Is itrunning on a local or a remote database, or is it acting as a database serverfor other systems?andM;The Database Manager adds a minimum of about 1.5M bytes to the RAM needs ofthe base OS/2 operating system, when running either alone or as a client ofanother system.andP;  With both server and client software in place, itsrequirements increase to 5M bytes or more.andM;For example, in one of PC Week's tests with the OS/2 Communications Managerrunning, the Database Manager was unable to start up successfully on a systemequipped with 4M bytes of RAM.andP;  Both ran successfully, however, on an 8M-bytesystem.andM;The Database Manager also uses more RAM as it serves more clients.andP;  Eachactive client consumes RAM for such things as locks and data buffers.andP;  With alarge number of client PCs, RAM requirements are sure to grow well beyond 8Mbytes.andM;Not surprisingly, Gupta Technologies Inc.'s SQLBase Server also needs morememory as it serves more users.andP;  Its minimum RAM requirement of at least 1.3Mbytes does not include the RAM necessary to run OS/2 and the LAN Manager,both of which are required.andM;Buyers should plan on having at least 6M bytes installed, and preferably 8Mbytes or more, for their SQLBase Server systems.andM;The SQLWindows client DOS PCs that run with the SQLBase Server have high RAMrequirements, too.andP;  To be able to exercise all the functions of SQLWindows1.2.1, the vendor suggests at least 2M bytes of RAM.andP;  PC Week's tests ranfine using 2M bytes, but the requirement might well grow with the newversion, 1.3, which runs under Windows 3.0.andM;Craving Powerful ProcessorsandM;Both products cry out for powerful processors.andP;  Even when running on a 25MHz486 system and with a local database, the Query Manager periodically pausedfor several seconds while generating forms and reports against a PC Weeksample table that contained less than 50 records.andP;  Clearly, the DatabaseManager, like much of OS/2, really demands a 386 or 486 CPU.andM;SQLWindows has similar requirements.andP;  It exhibited slightly longer delays ona system that had a mere 25MHz 386 CPU.andM;Worse was Gupta's Express Windows, which took well over a minute on the samesystem to generate and run a sample form against a database table containingonly two columns.andP;  Running SQLWindows on a 286 system against a database ofany size is likely to produce considerable delays.andM;-- M.L.V.N and B.C.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
