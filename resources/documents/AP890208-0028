Trump appeared Tuesday with representatives of Milton Bradley Co.at a Trump Tower news conference to unveil ``Trump _ The Game.''   ``Trump'' is somewhat like Parker Bros.'s Monopoly in that theplayer with the most money wins. But the Trump ``T'' has replacedMonopoly game pieces like the shoe, the thimble and the iron, andthe highest Trump denomination is $100 million instead of $500.   And unlike Monopoly, the new game features pictures of Trump theman on the money, game board, playing cards and the box.   ``It's a much more sophisticated game than Monopoly,'' Trumpsaid. ``I like to play Monopoly _ I've played it all my life, inmany forms.''   Capitalists ages 12 and older are invited to ``share in theexciting high-stakes risk-taking I get to do every day. ... If youare clever, aggressive and cut the best deals, you can earn millions... even billions of dollars. Just remember: Play to win ... or notat all!''   Trump said his proceeds from the $25 game, which will hittoy-store shelves this spring, will go to causes like cerebralpalsy, AIDS and the homeless.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sir Rudolf Bing, former Metropolitan Operaimpresario and victim of Alzheimer's disease, was unaware he hadmarried Carroll Douglass when he was interviewed 18 months after thewedding, a psychiatrist said.

He statedthat she was a friend.''   The psychiatrist said Bing did not have the ``cognitivewherewithal at that time to enter into a marriage contract.''   Roberto Mei, owner of the Fontana di Trevi restaurant, which wasfrequented by the Bings, testified that Bing agreed at his wife'ssuggestion to accompany her to England.   A few minutes later, Mei said, he walked by Bing's table andheard him ask Ms. Douglass, ``And what did you say your name was?''   The Bings subsequently went on an apparently aimless odyssey withstops in Florida, the Caribbean and England, depending in large parton the help of strangers.</TEXT><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``Tapestry,'' a play based on songwriter CaroleKing's music, is to open on Broadway in May, the producers said.
