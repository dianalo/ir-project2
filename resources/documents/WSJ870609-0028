The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered quickly from an opening slide as the dollar and bonds rebounded from their early lows. The industrial average climbed into the plus column and gained almost steadily for the rest of the session, finishing ahead 25.49 points at 2351.64.    The transportation average rose 14.76 to 1001.42. Strong gains in airline stocks gave the average a big push.    The advance in the stock market appeared all the more impressive when compared with bonds. Bond prices finished lower on the day, although they were well above their early-session lows.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.27 to 296.72, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.64 to 167.13. Gainers outpaced losers on the Big Board by a 2-to-1 margin.    Much to the continuing dismay of traders and brokers, and despite the upbeat tone of the stock market, trading volume remained sluggish. At the Big Board, 136.4 million shares changed hands, compared with 129.1 million shares Friday.    Some market players, eager for news that might explain the stock market advance, took a brighter view on developments that might come from the economic summit of seven industrialized nations that got under way in Venice.    They saw President Reagan's move to lift 17% of the $300 million package of trade sanctions against Japan as a step toward a less restrictive trade policy. These market participants are hoping the action will prompt a reciprocal move from the Japanese.    &quot;I can't believe this was a unilateral gesture,&quot; said Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., referring to the lifting of some trade sanctions against the Japanese.    Mr. Metz expects Japan might follow with a similar move. Meanwhile, as a result of yesterday's summit meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone indicated to President Reagan that Japan still intends to maintain its policy of keeping short-term rates low.    Although there are few expectations that significant policy changes will come of the Venice meeting, analysts said they would welcome any action that leads to a firmer dollar and brings foreign investors back to the U.S. market.    Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said that recent low volume and the still modest number of issues advancing each day suggest that the Dow Jones Industrial Average might stay in a trading range of between 2260 and 2500 for the next few weeks. He expects the industrial average to set a modest high this month but thinks July and August will be dull.    The continued low volume kept some traders from getting too enthusiastic about yesterday's advance.    Traders said they saw some buying interest for technology and bank stocks.    Among technology issues, International Business Machines rose 1 1/4 to 161 1/4, Digital Equipment gained 2 3/8 to 164 3/8, NEC added 1 3/4 to 26 1/2, Unisys moved up 1 7/8 to 120 and Cray Research rose 2 5/8 to 96 3/8. But Honeywell fell 1 1/8 to 79 5/8.    J.P. Morgan rose 2 1/8 to 47 5/8, Bankers Trust added 1 1/2 to 50 1/8, Citicorp moved up 1 1/2 to 59 3/4 and Chase Manhattan gained 7/8 to 40 1/4. Several analysts said demand for these stocks was stirred by a report in the New York Times that the Treasury might be inclined to ease regulatory restrictions on bank mergers to allow for the creation of &quot;superbanks&quot; to compete with the Japanese.    Airline stocks were mostly higher. NWA rose 2 3/4 to 70 1/8, Delta Air Lines gained 1 to 56, AMR moved up 7/8 to 58 1/8 and USAir added 5/8 to 44.    Expectations of higher fares sparked interest in airline stocks. Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit said it would match Trans World Airlines' recently announced fare increases because of higher fuel costs.    Allegis fell 3/8 to 89 1/2. Allegis management is considering several courses of action, including sweetening its own planned cash distribution to shareholders, following a restructuring proposal presented by United Airlines' pilots late last week.    Holly Sugar closed up 1 1/4 to 104 1/2 after trading as high as 108 1/2. The company got a buyout bid from Brookehill Equities at $110 a share in cash and securities.    Research-Cottrell jumped 5 1/8 to 44 on volume of more than 1.5 million shares. The company agreed to accept a leveraged buyout proposal at $43 a share from a group including Odyssey Partners, Allen andamp; Co. and First Chicago Venture Capital.    Uspci lost 2 1/4 to 44 3/4. The company rejected a $43-a-share takeover bid from Union Pacific, whose stock eased 1/2 to 73 1/8.    Pacific Gas andamp; Electric eased 5/8 to 20 3/4 on more than 9.9 million shares, making it the most active Big Board issue. Traders said the increased trading activity probably came from investors buying the stock in time to receive the next dividend payment, due July 15 to stock of record next Monday. The stock begins trading ex-dividend today.    Most drug stocks participated in yesterday's rally. Merck rose 2 to 162 3/4, Bristol-Myers gained 1 1/2 to 98 7/8, Johnson andamp; Johnson added 1 1/2 to 89 1/4, Eli Lilly moved up 2 1/8 to 91 3/8, Squibb advanced 3 1/4 to 179 1/4 and Pfizer rose 5/8 to 69 1/8.    Because many of these companies are multinationals, they usually benefit from weakness in the dollar because the lower U.S. currency is beneficial when the companies translate their foreign profits.    Carter-Wallace closed up 4 1/4 at 110 after trading as high as 114. The stock, which rose 9 7/8 Friday, was recommended by Salomon Brothers; the firm began coverage of the pharmaceutical company yesterday.    Olin fell 1 5/8 to 49 3/4. The stock was taken off Bear Stearns's recommended list.    Beneficial Corp. moved up 3 1/8 to 54 3/8. Bear Stearns was said to have recommended the stock. </TEXT></DOC>
