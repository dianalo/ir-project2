Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said 28 civilianswere killed in the attack on the capital and in Iraqi raids on fourother cities.   The agency said Iraqi troops lobbed chemical bombs into Halabjaand Dojaila in the Kurdistan region, ``killing many defenselessresidents.'' It gave no other details.   Iran had reported overruning Dojaila and that Halabja, a town of70,000 inhabitants near the border, was under siege.   Iraq denied there has been any fighting in the region, sayingthere were no Iraqi armed forces there. It claimed the Iraniansmoved into some Kurdistan villages unchallenged.   Iran also reported air raids on the cities of Bakhtaran, Tabriz,Miyaneh and Abadan. It gave no breakdown of the civilian deaths.   The missile strike was reported by the official Iraqi NewsAgency, which said Iraq is bombarding ``the nest of evil, thehideout of the charlatans, because instead of accepting peace theyhave chosen the course of aggression.''   Iraq says it has launched 23 missiles into the Iranian capitalsince Sunday, when the ``war of the cities'' reignited after atwo-day truce.   Iran has reported firing seven missiles into Baghdad and dozensinto Basra, Iraq's second largest city.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian forcestoday fired seven short-range missiles into Zoubair, an industrialtown south of Basra. It said the attacks were in response to``Iraq's latest atrocities,'' but did not elaborate. The newsagency said long-range artillery also pounded a string of townsclose to the 730-mile front.   Neither side has been precise on casualties, but Iran said 70people were killed in Iraqi attacks Wednesday on Tehran and citiesin western Iran.   Iran claimed its ground offensive into northeastern Iraq'sSulaymaniyah province gained momentum with the capture shortlyafter midnight of Dojaila, which IRNA said has a population of20,000.   The Iraqi agency quoted an unidentified spokesman as denyingthere has been any combat in the region and that there are no Iraqitroops in the area.   He said Iranian troops marched on Halabja and leveled it.   IRNA said Iranian Revolutionary Guards also seized key roadintersections, cutting off all supply routes to the region fromBaghdad, which is 160 miles to the south. Iraq has not reported anymajor fighting in the snow-capped mountainous province.   IRNA said 2,500 Iraqi soldiers were killed or wounded and 1,000captured in the fighting, raising the number of Iraqi casualties intwo days to 3,600 with 1,800 prisoners taken. It gave no breakdownfor the dead and wounded and the figures could not be independentlyconfirmed.   The news agency said Iranian combatants had seized 115 squaremiles of Iraqi territory in the region, including about 40 villagesand towns. It said the prisoners included Maj. Gen. Ali HusseinObaid Al-Algawi, who it described as the commander of Iraq's 43rdinfantry division.   IRNA also said Iranian warplanes struck economic targets in theregion in pre-dawn raids and that two Iraqi warplanes were downed.   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council in New York demanded anend to the missile attacks on Baghdad and Tehran and endorsedanother round of negotiations by Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar on implementing its July 20 cease-fire resolution aimed atending the 7{-year-old war.   Iran has criticized the Security Council for failing to takeaction on the war of the cities and one diplomat said Tehran hasbroken all ties to the body.   Both Iran and Iraq are known to possess internationally bannedweapons, and Iraq has been condemned by the Security Council forusing chemical bombs.</TEXT></DOC>
