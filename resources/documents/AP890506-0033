Atleast 15 people were killed.   Three people died in Lincoln County, North Carolina, when atwister struck Friday evening, according to the state emergencymanagement office in Raleigh. The tornado touched down first inLawndale in adjacent Cleveland County at about 7 p.m.   ``It went north by northeast, leveling homes and everything inits path,'' said Gene Morrison of the Lawndale Rescue Squad.Seventeen people were injured, some seriously, he said.   ``It's like you took a chain saw and cut down all the trees andleveled all the houses,'' said Bill Seagle, a member of the UpperCleveland Rescue Squad. ``Cars were thrown all over the place.''   The twister struck near the Cleveland-Lincoln county line andauthorities initially reported that three people died in eachcounty. Cleveland County officials later confirmed that there wereno deaths in their jurisdiction.   The storms, which followed major damage Thursday in Texas andLouisiana, also ripped up houses and downed trees and power linesin South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama. Andhail as big as baseballs fell near Lufkin in eastern Texas.   In New Orleans, the storm ripped at least one of the Jazz andHeritage Festival's big tents, blew others down and did some damageto nearly all of the 10 stages and tents where 140,000 peoplegathered over three days last weekend, said spokeswoman AnnaZimmerman.   Friday's daytime activities _ including dozens of concerts onstages and tents set up among food booths and craft exhibits _ werecanceled so crews could pull things back together. A concertscheduled Friday night was moved to the city's municipal auditorium.   At least three people died, including an infant, and severalwere injured in Spartanburg County, S.C., when tornadoes toucheddown in the evening, authorities said.   In Gainesville, Ga., a tornado hit near Interstate 985, injuringat least nine people, most in auto accidents, Civil DefenseDirector Bill Banks said. Two victims were in critical condition.   ``We had at least two vehicles blown into the woods upside down,one van and one automobile,'' said Reggie Forrester, Hall Countypublic safety director. ``We had a van upside down on the entranceramp. ... We had several other vehicles blown around andoverturned.''   Another twister that hit the western Kentucky city of WestLouisville destroyed one house and damaged four others.   In North Carolina, four people trapped in a house were rescued,but two were seriously injured, authorities said. Others werereportedly trapped in vehicles.   Late Thursday, several tornadoes roared through the north Texastown of Granbury, sending 22 people to a hospital for treatment ofminor injuries.   ``It was just like they always said: you could hear it coming,it came and then we shook for a long time. We all prayed,'' saidElvin Funkhouser. He and his wife, Janet, lay in their ground-floorkitchen while twisters shredded the second story of their home in asubdivision near Granbury.   Hood County Sheriff Edwin Tomlinson said at least 15 trailersand homes were destroyed, with about 200 others damaged. But RedCross spokesman Richard Hensley said 65 trailers and houses weredestroyed.   Wind speeds of near 100 mph were reported Thursday inthunderstorms in Texas from Dallas County to near Waco, the weatherservice said. Gusts to 78 mph were reported at Wichita Falls,Texas, and to 80 to 90 mph at Eldorado, Okla.   The storms derailed a train in Hurst, a suburb northeast of FortWorth. Early Thursday, high wind derailed 10 empty cars of a coaltrain near the Panhandle community of Dawn. No one was injured.   The weather also was blamed for one death in Oklahoma and sevenin Texas, most of them drownings. The body of a man whose truck wasfound in a Texas creek was found later Friday.   About 255,000 customers in north-central and eastern Texas lostelectricity because of the storms, and 27,500 remained withoutpower late Friday, said Dave Fiorelli, a senior engineer for TexasUtilities Electric in Dallas. He said it was the greatest number ofdisruptions he could remember since a January 1979 ice stormparalyzed northern Texas.   Power lines were extensively damaged in Louisiana. Officials ofLouisiana Power andamp; Light Co. worked throughout the day to returnpower to some 12,000 homes throughout the state Friday. ``That'sdown from 50,000 last night,'' Mike Sanders of Louisiana Power andamp;Light Co. said Friday.   A string of 89 high-voltage transmission towers toppled in a50-mile stretch from Tallulah, La., across the Mississippi River toVicksburg, Miss. The towers were 65 feet tall.   ``We surmise the towers were knocked down by tornadoes and adomino effect,'' said Charles Thacker of LPandamp;L.   Standing water closed several highways for a time Friday aroundLouisiana, including Interstate 20, which was under up to 5 feet ofwater near West Monroe, state police said.   Sheriff's deputies said one man's body was found in about twofeet of water in Calhoun in northern Louisiana and two others weremissing, including a 9-year-old boy.
