(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crisp, red apples and test tubes of tinytrees in a lab cooler represent hope for the future ofchemical-free fruit production.   Already, researchers have developed new varieties with naturalresistance to major diseases, reducing the need for fungicides,said Schuyler Safi Korban, head of the University of Illinoisbreeding program, who hopes genetic engineering can improve theprocess even further.   ``Now, with all the concern over the use of chemicals thesevarieties will become more important. Growers are coming to usasking where they can get these varieties,'' said Korban. Illinois'program has produced nine varieties since the Prima was introducedtwo decades ago to resist apple scab disease.   Growers might have sprayed fungicide 12 times a season toprevent scab disease, but resistant varieties have cut Illinois' $1million-a-year chemical bill for apples by 60 percent, he said.   Newer varieties include Jonafree, Redfree, Williams' Pride andDayton. The apples are resistant to scab and, in varying degrees,fire blight, apple cedar rust and powdery mildew _ among the mostprevalent diseases in the industry, and some are even resistant tobugs.   Consumers were slow to switch from their favorite Red Deliciousand Jonathan apples, Korban said, but recent controversysurrounding the chemical Alar and its link with cancer changedthat. Alar was used by some growers to keep apples colorful andfresh on trees longer, extending the harvest.   ``We're making progress in reducing chemical use, though it maynot be as fast as some would like,'' said Paul Curtis, who operatesa 5,000-tree orchard and grows varieties developed at the Illinois,including Jonafree.   Conventional breeding has led to the new varieties of appleswith disease and insect resistance. Korban hopes geneticengineering will speed and improve the process and givealready-popular varieties resistance.   ``It is a great idea but these things take years to develop andtest,'' said Ron Meyer of the Illinois Apple and Peach MarketingBoard. ``It took 25 years to develop good varieties that wereresistant to scab.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
