The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended more than 3/8point lower, a decline of more than $3.75 for a bond with a$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in theopposite direction of its price, rose to 7.99% from 7.95%.Municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities were mostlyunchanged to slightly lower. Corporate bonds ended modestlylower.</LP><TEXT>   In the Treasury market, dealers said the market movedlower due to profit-taking by traders who bought securitiesat last week's record $34.5 billion Treasury quarterlyrefunding but who didn't want to carry the securities intoFriday's economic releases.   &quot;There was some concern that the data might not be quiteas favorable as is generally expected,&quot; says Elliott Platt,director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp.   Mr. Platt says data so far this week hasn't been as direfor the economy as bond traders had hoped, making marketparticipants nervous that Friday's data might not signal suchbad news for the economy -- and good news for bonds -- astraders thought.   The most significant of today's data is expected to be the8:30 a.m. EST release of January producer prices. Economistssurveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect thereport to say that PPI rose 0.1% in January and 0.2%excluding the food and energy components. Those relativelylow inflation levels would tend to encourage the bond market.In December, the PPI fell 0.6%, largely because of decliningenergy prices, but the index excluding food and energy rose0.3%.   Industrial production, also due out today, is seen down0.6%, according to another Capital Markets Report survey,while the U.S. trade gap is expected to fall to $8.8 billion.   Mr. Platt says those who bailed out of the bond marketyesterday were too hasty. &quot;Bonds are going to benefit fromthe data,&quot; he says. &quot;There was an excess of caution&quot; in themarket this session.   Despite the confidence of DLJ's Mr. Platt that bonds willtrade higher on the release of economic data, traders saythey're skeptical that the market can benefit much from thefigures. That's why so many of them liquidated portions oftheir positions this session.   In recent weeks, market participants have &quot;set themselvesup for disappointment,&quot; by being too optimistic, said one NewYork coupon trader. &quot;They've set themselves up needing goodnumbers.&quot;   The market showed little reaction yesterday to economicreports that were released during the session. Initial stateunemployment claims were up 39,000 to 456,000, while Decemberbusiness inventories declined 0.7%. Neither figure showed theeconomy weak enough to persuade bond traders to makesignificant changes in their positions in advance of theproducer price data.   Bond prices lost a little more ground in late tradingafter the Federal Reserve released money supply data that wasstronger than expected.   For the week of Feb. 4, the basic money supply aggregate,M1, was up $3.3 billion from the previous week. Expectationshad been for a rise of only $1.2 billion. M1 consists ofreadily available spending funds and cash.   The markets have begun watching the money supply data onlyrecently, since Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspansaid he saw the data as a key indicator of economic weakness.   But William Sullivan, head of money market research atDean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the figure &quot;is nothing to getall bent out of shape about. The monthly Ms showed continuedweakness.&quot;   January money supply figures showed M1 rose $1.6 billionfrom December. Analysts had expected a rise of $0.8 billion.M2 was up $2.8 billion for the month, against expectations ofa $1.9 billion rise, while M3 was up $13.1 billion comparedwith analysts' estimates of a $12.1 billion gain.   For the week of Feb. 4, M2 was up $4.9 billion and M3gained $2.1 billion. Expectations for M2 had been for a $3.8billion rise and for a gain of $4.5 billion in M3.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          A mild rally among cable-TV company bonds provided sometonic to an otherwise lackluster junk-bond market.   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with lowcredit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended the dayabout 1/4 point lower.   The notable exceptions were bonds of companies such asAdelphia Communications Corp. and Cablevisions IndustriesInc. The 13% senior subordinated notes of Adelphia jumped 2points to 44; the 11.25% senior subordinated debentures ofCablevision Industries added 1 point to 52; the 12.75% seniorsubordinated debentures of Century Communications Co.advanced 2 points to 86.   Jonathan Blatt, head of high-yield trading at Printon KaneGroup Inc., says cable bonds had been sharply discounted andare now rising along with the broader high-yield market whichhas recently been strong.   &quot;They came under a lot of pressure from the hearings onre-regulation and now people are re-evaluating them,&quot; saysMr. Blatt.   Ben Bendre, a junk bond analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.,says there recently has been broad-based interest in thecable sector.   &quot;It is the one sector that continues to chug along andreport good cash flow growth,&quot; he said.   Like many other industries, the cable sector has also beenbuoyed by the prospects of lower interest rates.   Mr. Bendre says about six to nine months ago, bankstightened their lending standards toward cable companies. Atthe time, many investors feared that the industry would notbe able to access capital for expansion and some of themore-leveraged players would not be able to roll over theirbank financing.   Now with interest rates headed lower and the FederalReserve trying to encourage banks to lend, some of thatconcern overhanging the cable sector has been lifted, saidMr. Bendre.   Investment-grade corporate bonds were modestly lower.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point lower.   Moody's Investors Service Inc. assigned a single-A ratingto a $900 million issue of revenue bonds by the New YorkLocal Government Assistance Corp., a level that generallymatched expectations. The sale, expected via negotiation nextweek, would mark the first for the corporation.   Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its single-A-minus ratingon Chicago general obligation bonds. About $394 million ofoutstanding uninsured GO debt and $53.8 million of GOrefunding bonds expected to sell soon are affected by theaction.   In other secondary trading, New York City generalobligation bonds firmed up in the aftermath of the city'ssuccessful $1 billion general obligation sale Wednesday.   Yields on long New York City general obligation bondsdropped as low as 8.29%, before inching back up to around8.32% after municipals eased late in the session.   Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey TurnpikeAuthority's 7.20% issues of 2018 were unchanged at 100 1/2 toyield 7.14%.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage-securities prices ended mostly unchanged toslightly lower.   In secondary activity, 8.5% issues from all three agencieswere down 2/32. Government National Mortgage Associationsecurities were at 98 28/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.securities were at 98 14/32 and Federal National MortgageAssociation securities were at 98 9/32.   There was one new real estate mortgage investment conduitoffering and one issue backed by credit-card receivablesannounced yesterday.   The Remic, a $420.1 million Fannie Mae issue called series1991-20, is being offered by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and isbeing backed by 15-year Fannie Mae 9.5% securities.   The asset-backed sector received a $500 million DiscoverCard Trust 1991-A offering that was priced as 8.10%securities at 99.473 to yield 8.32% by Dean Witter ReynoldsInc.   The credit-card receivables backing the deal are beingsold by Discover Receivables Financing Corp. Both Discoverand Dean Witter are units of retailer Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.   Underwriters expect a triple-A rating from both Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., based onthe quality of the underlying receivables and a subordinatedclass of securities that totals 10% of the senior class.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of German government bonds surged yesterday onrumors that a Cologne newspaper will report today thatFinance Ministry officials are prepared to raise 30 billionmarks ($20.48 billion) through higher taxes.   Germany's benchmark 10-year bond jumped 1 1/4 points,sending yields below 8.25%. That was the lowest yield levelon 10-year bonds in a year. Traders said the rally was led byinternational investors and the dealers in the futuresmarket.   The report, which is expected to appear in the KoelnerExpress newspaper today, cites a six-page confidential memothat outlines a one percentage point increase in the nation's14% value-added tax and four pfennig to five pfennigincreases in the mineral oil tax. A portion of the articlewas released in advance.   The existence of such a confidential memo was denied byBonn officials. &quot;There are no reviews or plans under way toincrease revenue for the government budget,&quot; said Karlheinzvon den Driesch, the finance ministry's top spokesman.   Economists say, however, that the VAT and the oil tax aremost likely candidates for an increase. A tax boost is seenas necessary to contain Germany's widening budget deficits inthe face of high spending for eastern Germany and the PersianGulf war.</TEXT></DOC>
