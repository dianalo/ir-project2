Comparison with isotope shifts in 2-aryl-2-propyl cations demonstratesa change in the type of response to isotopic perturbation in 2-aryl-2-norbornylcations as electron demand increases. The results are consistent withthe onset of {sigma}-bridging as electron demand increases. The observedisotope shift at a cation center is suggested to be a sum of contributionsfrom a small upfield shift due to perturbation of the sigma-framework(inductive-type perturbation), a downfield shift due to perturbationof hyperconjugation, and a potentially large upfield shift from perturbationof three-center, two-electron bonding. NMR isotope shifts may be a particularlysensitive probe of sigma-bridging because of the vibrational origin ofthe isotope effect.</TEXT></DOC>
