George Bush was most often the target of the other five, whonever hesitated to list his shortcomings.   But all that is forgotten now, as Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, AlexanderHaig Jr., Pete du Pont and Pat Robertson join the Republicanconvention this week in singing Bush's praises.   While Bush is the undisputed star of the GOP unity fest, theother five are by no means shrinking violets during the week'sactivities.   Two are busily keeping themselves at the front of the vicepresidential sweepstakes; three will be prominently featured inprime-time slots at the convention; and all five are making therounds with delegate speeches, media interviews and receptions intheir honor.   Each of the former candidates was given a spot to address theconvention hall, du Pont and Haig shortly after the opening gavelon Monday morning, and Robertson, Kemp and Dole in the prizedprime-time slots at evening sessions.   Du Pont, in an eloquent version of the message he has beendelivering since his dismal showing in the primaries, said theDemocrats are looking to the policies of yesterday while Bush andthe Republicans are the ``party willing to explore, examine and putnew ideas to work.''   ``You have to feel a little wistful,'' the former Delawaregovernor said in an interview when asked about seeing Bush receivethe party's nomination. ``I love the process, I enjoyed what I wasdoing, I'd love to still be doing it. But George was a littlestronger this year.''   Haig, the former secretary of state who has served under sevenpresidents, said he will join Bush's surrogate speaking team and``do everything I can to get George Bush elected president.''   Haig, who often directed the most pointed barbs at Bush duringGOP primary debates, said in an interview Monday that Bush ``is aswell qualified a candidate as our party has ever put forward.''   ``We're in New Orleans to unify our party, to endorse our worthynominee George Bush,'' he told the delegates Monday.   Dole, the senator from Kansas and Kemp, the New Yorkcongressman, meanwhile, have been dashing around New Orleanscampaign-style _ from breakfasts to receptions to luncheon speechesto interviews and TV shows.   Both are said to be on Bush's short list as he deliberates whowill be his running mate and both have said they would accept thejob.   At a breakfast sponsored by Bell South on Monday, Dole thankedhis primary supporters. But he added, ``That's behind us and nowwe're on to the big event where George Bush will become the 41stpresident of the United States.''   Wife Elizabeth sounded as if she were promoting her husband forthe second spot on the ticket, saying, ``I was very proud of thefact that literally a week after Bob withdrew from the presidentialrace he was out working hard, and I mean hard, for George Bush. Hedoesn't look back.''   Kemp, being pushed for the second spot by conservatives, has afull schedule. He's encouraging Republican enthusiasm for theparty's conservative platform and attacking the Democratic ticketof Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.   But mostly, Kemp is stirring up support for his own vicepresidential ambitions, saying Monday that he ``could be a goodsecond string quarterback for George Bush.''   Robertson, the television evangelist who raised $25 million butfailed to attract significant voter support, has set up a largecampaign office near the French Quarter. But so far there seems tohave been little activity in the office.   Arriving in New Orleans on Monday, Robertson spoke party unitybut insisted that the conservative views he espoused will bevindicated in the election this fall.   ``We are getting ready to show why Republicans should be electednext fall and why George Bush should be the next president of theUnited States,'' he said.   Robertson is to address the convention Tuesday night, and willbe honored at a rally afterward.   Robertson announced last week that he would not enter his nameinto nomination, removing the last potential wave on the otherwisesmooth convention waters.</TEXT></DOC>
