(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A homegrown ballet company is hoppingmad over the city's invitation to the Cincinnati Ballet,particularly since the larger company will perform the``Nutcracker'' a week before its own version.   ``We feel terrified,'' Cheryl Van Metre, artistic director ofthe local Appalachian Ballet Company, said Monday. ``I hate to bein competition with them. It boils down to having money.''   The Knoxville Arts Council has welcomed a plan to have theCincinnati Ballet come south for the fall-winter season each yearas City Ballet. The council says it's a great way to bringprofessional, big-city ballet to this east Tennessee city of180,000.   The smaller company, though, fears losing the audience for itsbread-and-butter production _ the popular Christmas classicchoreographed to Tchaikovsky's ``Nutcracker Suite.'' Its Nutcrackeris scheduled Dec. 4, a week after the Cincinnati Ballet's.   ``We are a semiprofessional group of local dancers and we'veperformed in Knoxville and all the surrounding areas for 11years,'' said Ms. Van Metre, who studied at London's Royal Balletbefore returning home to Knoxville. ``(Nutcracker) makes the mostamount of profit for us. This is how we make our money to exist''in addition to receiving grant money, she said.   Her company, she adds, contributes to the community by bringingballet to public schools across an area often associated with buckdancing and bluegrass music.   Carol Hicks, project director for City Ballet, acknowledged thestruggle that the Appalachian Ballet has on its hands but saidthere was little anyone could do.   ``Our feeling is that we're bringing in a different caliber ofdance,'' she said. ``This is an opportunity for Knoxville to have aworld-renown dance troupe.   ``It's regrettable. I know it's going to be a thorn in theirside. We've asked them to come to our meetings to talk aboutthings,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
