<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0508 </DOCNO><TEXT>An extensive review was conducted of a variety of radiation-induced microstructuraldata, searching for microstructural records of various irradiation creepmechanisms. It was found that the stress-affected evolution of dislocationmicrostructure during irradiation is considerably more complex than envisionedin most theoretical modelling studies, particularly in the types of interactivefeedback mechanisms operating. Reasonably conclusive evidence was foundfor a SIPA-type mechanism (stress-induced preferential absorption) operatingon both Frank loops and network dislocations. Stress-induced preferentialloop nucleation (SIPN) processes may also participate but are thoughtto be overshadowed by the stronger action of SIPA-type processes operatingon Frank interstitial loops. It was not possible to discern from microstructuralevidence between second-order SIPA and first-order SIPA mechanisms, thelatter arising from anisotropic diffusion. Evidence is presented, however,that validates the operation of stress-induced preferential unfaultingof Frank loops and stress-induced growth of previously stressed materialfollowing removal of applied stress. Dislocation glide mechanisms arealso participating but the rate appears to be controlled by SIPA-typeclimb processes. Applied stresses are shown to generate very anisotropicdistributions of Burgers vector in the irradiation-induced microstructure.</TEXT></DOC>
