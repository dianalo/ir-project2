But despite the fanfare, Microsoft Corp.'s new operating system for the machines won't be available for a couple of years. Without such internal software, the computers can't take full advantage of the Intel Corp. microprocessor.    Some small software companies, however, are already selling &quot;extender&quot; packages that tap the chip's extraordinary power. The extenders work primarily by enhancing Microsoft's existing MS-DOS operating system, which was developed for personal computers with less powerful microprocessors. Some companies have even developed applications software such as data-base programs for 80386 computers to work with these souped-up MS-DOS systems.    There probably won't be much of a market for the extenders when Microsoft's 80386 operating system arrives, but software companies are betting that a large number of users want access to the chip's power now. Furthermore, the operating-system gap gives small companies an opportunity to make a name for themselves by providing software specifically for the Intel chip.    &quot;We're two years off before we see even the beginning of a 386 operating system,&quot; says Richard Shaffer, publisher of Technologic Computer Letter. &quot;Entire companies can be made and folded in that amount of time.&quot;    THE 80386 COMPUTER is a formidable machine, even without the new operating system. It runs MS-DOS software two to three times faster than a PC based on Intel's 80286 chip, which also awaits an operating system that fully taps its powers. The problem is that MS-DOS can only deal with 640 kilobytes of memory at a time, or 320 double-spaced, typewritten pages -- some PC programs already need much of that memory. The 80386 chip, on the other hand, can grab four gigabytes of memory -- the equivalent of some two million typewritten pages, or the power of certain mainframe computers in the 1970s.    &quot;To have (memory) out there dangling is like having the carrot dangling on the end of a stick,&quot; says Alexander D. Jacobson, president of Inference Corp., a software concern.    MS-DOS can't get the job done because it doesn't recognize the coded instructions necessary to unlock the chip's real power. MS-DOS software is written to send instructions in 16-bit increments; the 80386 chip expects 32-bit chunks of data.    IN ESSENCE, the 80386 microprocessor is like three chips in one with one part assigned the job of opening up the 80386 machine's massive memory. The trick is to tap that mode, and small software companies such as Softguard Systems Inc. and Phar Lap Software Inc. have conjured up software for that purpose. For example, the extender, the layer of software between MS-DOS and the 32-bit applications program, allows the user to leave MS-DOS and operate in the portion of the chip that gets access to the 80386 computer's memory.    MS-DOS takes over again when the applications program turns to such mundane tasks as storing data in the machine's hard disk. &quot;That request is sent back to DOS,&quot; says Evan Lim, product marketing director at Softguard. &quot;(The extender) uses the existing operating system to do the hard work.&quot;    Softguard also makes a software package that draws upon the 80386 chip's ability to do many tasks. Software Link Inc. is more bold. The company is challenging Microsoft with its own operating system, which also exploits the chip's multitasking and power.    IN ADDITION, these companies sell &quot;tool kits&quot; that allow software publishers to recode their programs to send 32-bit instructions and to wrap in the operating-system extenders. The recoded software alone makes a big difference. A Lotus Development Corp. spreadsheet program on an PC &quot;takes over a minute to recalculate. If Lotus recoded it to take advantage of the 386 (chip), it would do it in six seconds,&quot; says Tom Spalding, president of AI Architects Inc., which makes 80386 upgrade boards that also include extenders.    There's already evidence that software publishers are interested in such programs. Since November, for instance, Phar Lap has sold 200 software tool kits. &quot;It's a bridge for software developers to sell products for two years,&quot; says Richard Smith, Phar Lap's president. &quot;They already have a market and their customers are screaming for more memory.&quot;    In fact, users of memory-hungry, computer-aided design programs accounted for more than half of the 80386 machines purchased from Compaq in the past six months, says International Data Corp., a market research concern.    Viewlogic Systems Inc. has already developed engineering software for the 80386 computer that helps evaluate electronic circuit designs. Fox Software plans to unveil a data-base program for the machine in June. &quot;There's quite a market, and we want to be the first ones there,&quot; says Eric Christensen, a technical engineer with Fox.    But the size of such a market is questionable, warns Thomas Roberts, a research manager at International Data. These products won't attract much attention from software makers unless large computer makers combine the extenders with their machines. Until then, he says, &quot;there's no real chance&quot; the market will take off. </TEXT></DOC>
