Mark Stevens of San Antonio, a lawyer representing death rowinmate Donald Gene Franklin, argued that the law, as applied,stacks the deck in favor of death over life in prison.   Stevens said the jurors who sentenced Franklin for the 1975murder of a San Antonio nurse were prevented from giving fullconsideration to ``mitigating circumstances,'' those factorssuggesting life in prison as the appropriate punishment.   ``Consideration of particularized mitigating circumstances wasnot allowed,'' Stevens contended.   But William C. Zapalac, an assistant state attorney general,urged the justices to uphold a federal appeals court ruling thatsaid Franklin was sentenced properly.   Noting that Franklin was allowed to present any mitigatingevidence he desired, Zapalac added, ``Franklin cannot reasonablyclaim that the jury could not see the relevance of the evidence hewanted to present.''   Under Texas law, capital case sentencing juries are asked twoquestions: whether the murder was committed deliberately andwhether the killer poses a continuing, violent threat to society.   If the jurors unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt thatthe answer to both questions is ``yes'' a death sentence is imposed.   But Stevens told the justices that the judge's instructions tojurors at Franklin's trial, similar to those typically used inTexas, directs the jury to consider all mitigating evidence inlight of the two questions.   For example, Stevens said the fact that Franklin had been awell-behaved prison inmate for seven years could only be used toconsider whether he was a continuing threat to society and not forsome other reason.   Justice John Paul Stevens, no relation to the lawyer, askedZapalac why such evidence could not be used by jurors to decidethat Franklin was a man of good character ``who should not die.''   Zapalac said Franklin failed to show that any other kind of juryinstruction would have helped him.   Franklin was convicted of abducting and killing 27-year-old MaryMargaret Moran.   His lawyer repeatedly said Tuesday he was not attacking theSupreme Court's 1976 decision, in a case called Jurek vs. Texas,that upheld the state's death penalty law. But the justices seemedskeptical that overturning Franklin's sentence could leave the 1976ruling intact.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist suggested that Stevens'arguments appeared to be ``cutting into Jurek.''   Justice Antonin Scalia said it seemed to him that the argumentcame down to whether ``the language of the statute'' did not allowfull and independent consideration of mitigating circumstances.   If the court were to rule that way, its decision could affectall Texas death row inmates. Out of about 2,000 death row inmatesnationwide, 260 are in Texas. That total is second only to Florida,which has about 280 inmates on death row.   A number of executions have been postponed in Texas pending thecourt's decision in the case, which is expected by July.   The case is Franklin vs. Lynaugh, 87-5546.</TEXT></DOC>
