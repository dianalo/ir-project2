(Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107.) Existing provisions of Title III of the Job Training PartnershipAct were replaced by EDWAA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking History</ITAG>On October 13, 1982, the President signed the Job Training PartnershipAct, Pub. L. 97-300 (JTPA or the Act).It is the purpose of the Act to establish programs to prepare youth andunskilled adults for entry into the labor force; and to afford job trainingto those economically disadvantaged individuals and others facing seriousbarriers to employment who are in special need of such training to obtainproductive employment.Title I of the Act sets forth general requirements for programs under theAct, as well as some requirements for State operation of programs underthe Act. Title II of the Act provides requirements for State operationof adult and youth programs under the Act. Title III of the Act providesfor operation of State programs of employment and training assistance fordislocated workers. Title IV provides requirements for special programsfor targeted groups, such as Native Americans and migrant farmworkers;as well as for the Job Corps, veterans and other specialized programs.Amendments to JTPA were enacted in the Job Training Partnership Act Amendments,Pub. L. 97-404 (December 31, 1982); the Carl D. Perkins Vocational EducationAct, Pub. L. 98-524 (October 19, 1984); the Job Training Partnership ActAmendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99-496 (October 16, 1986); and the HomelessEligibility Clarification Act, Title XI of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,Pub. L. 99-570 (October 27, 1986). See also Section 713(b) of Pub. L. 99-159,National Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Authorization Act of 1986,which contains technical amendments to the Carl D. Perkins Vocational EducationAct which, in turn, amend JTPA.Final regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor (the Departmentor DOL) to implement the provisions of the Act were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 48 FR 11078 (March 15, 1983); 48 FR 48753(October 20, 1983); 48 FR 49198 (October 24, 1983); and 48 FR 52438 (November18, 1983). See 20 CFR Parts 626-636 and 684 (1988).These regulations have been amended by <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication on three additional occasions: onApril 26, 1985, at 50 FR 16473, as corrected on June 13, 1985, at 50 FR24764; on August 29, 1986, at 51 FR 30856; and on February 12, 1988 at53 FR 4262.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Interim Final Rule</ITAG>The Department of Labor is issuing interim final regulations with a requestfor comments to implement provisions of the Economic Dislocation and WorkerAdjustment Assistance Act (EDWAA), which amends portions of the Job TrainingPartnership Act (JTPA) and substitutes a completely new Title III. EDWAAwas enacted as Subtitle D of Title VI of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct (OTCA) of 1988. JTPA Title III establishes programs of employment andtraining assistance for dislocated workers. These interim final regulationscomply with the statutory requirement that regulations be published byNovember 1, 1988. At the same time, they provide the opportunity for comment.All implementation actions which must be completed prior to the publicationof final regulations should be consistent with these regulations. Modificationof the JTPA regulations is necessary to incorporate the revisions containedin the amended legislation.It is important to note that the provisions of EDWAA related to employmentand training assistance for dislocated workers and other changes were enactedas amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act. Thus, as is the casewith existing regulations, provisions of the JTPA regulations in Parts626, 627, 628, and 629 which apply generally to JTPA programs includingTitle III, or which apply specifically to Title III are applicable to theamended Title III program unless revised herein. In numerous cases, asreflected in the following interim final regulations, it has been necessaryto revise sections of the existing regulations particularly in Parts 626,627, 628, and 629 to reflect provisions of the new legislation.It is the Department's intent in developing these regulations to providesubstantial responsibility and discretion to States in developing policyand implementing procedures for this new legislation. Thus, in many instancesin these regulations, responsibility for certain decisions is vested inthe State or in substate areas.It is the Department's plan to separately issue reporting instructionsand instructions for establishing and adjusting Title III performance standards.Both sets of instructions will be published as notices for comment in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. Copies will be made available to States by issuanceof Training and Employment Information Notices (TEINs).In publishing the interim final rule, certain JTPA general regulatory provisionsof Parts 628 and 629 have been revised to reflect their applicability ornon-applicability to EDWAA programs, including additions where necessaryto correspond to the provisions of the new Part 631. These changes aresummarized below. Statutory citations to JTPA also have been incorporatedthroughout the various sections of these parts.Section 626.4 includes an expanded definition of ``substate grantee'' toindicate that the substate grantee is the entity that receives Title IIIfunds for a substate area directly from the Governor.Section 627.4, which deals with the establishment and responsibilitiesof the State Job Training Coordinating Council (SJTCC), has been revisedby adding a reference to section 317 of the Act. This section of the Actcontains the new responsibilities of the SJTCC for Title III programs.In addition, EDWAA amends section 122(a)(3) of the Act to establish a newmembership composition for the SJTCC. The membership is to be composedof 30 percent business and industry representatives, 30 percent State andlocal government and local education representatives, 30 percent organizedlabor and community-based organization representatives, and 10 percentrepresentation from the general public. In a case in which the substatearea is a State, Governors are expected to consider the new compositionand responsibilities of the SJTCC where such council, or portion thereof,is being reconstituted to form the private industry council.Section 628.2 has been revised to add two new paragraphs (d) and (e) whichreflect the private industry councils' participation in the designationof substate grantees and their role in reviewing substate plans under TitleIII.Section 629.1(e) has been changed to incorporate a new reference to 29CFR Part 97 which supercedes 41 CFR Part 29-70.Section 629.3 has been revised to indicate that the nondiscrimination provisionsin section 167 of the Act and the prohibition regarding sectarian activitiesin section 167(a) of the Act apply to Title III substate grantees.A new andSection; 629.4 has been added to set forth in the regulations certainlabor standards of particular significance to Title III programs and whichreflect concerns raised in the enactment of EDWAA. These provisions prohibitassistance in the relocation of establishments when such relocation willresult in an increase in unemployment in the original location or any otherarea, and the displacement of employees by participants.Section 629.21(a) has been revised to indicate that the needs-based paymentprovisions apply only to Title II. Similar provisions that apply to TitleIII are contained at andSection; 631.20.Section 629.33 has been revised to indicate that the insurance provisionsapply to Title III substate grantees.Section 629.35(e) has been amended to indicate that the period of recordsretention for all JTPA records is three years from the last date authorizedfor expenditure of funds allotted to a State for a given program year,as set forth at section 161(b) of JTPA. This amendment is necessary toensure that such records exist and are available for the purposes of JTPAaudits.Section 629.36 has been revised to indicate that the semiannual reportingprovisions of this section apply only to Titles I and II. The reportingprovisions that apply to Title III are set forth at andSection; 631.15.Section 629.37(b) has been changed to incorporate a new reference to 29CFR Part 97 which supercedes 41 CFR Part 29-70.Section 629.38 has been changed to indicate that the classification ofcosts provisions of this section no longer apply to Title III except forthe provisions of andSection; 629.38(e)(2). The provisions that apply toTitle III in this regard are set forth at andSection; 631.13.Section 629.39 has been changed to indicate that the provisions of thissection on limitations on certain costs no longer apply to Title III programs.The provisions that apply to Title III in this regard are set forth inandSection; 631.14.Section 629.40 has been changed to reflect that there is no matching requirementfor Title III, as amended by EDWAA.Section 629.42 has been changed to indicate that the audit provisions ofthis section also apply to Title III substate grantees.Section 629.44 has been changed to indicate that the sanctions for violationsof the Act provisions of this section also apply to Title III substategrantees.Section 629.46 has been changed to indicate that the performance standardsprovisions of this section apply to Title III, except that the provisionsof paragraph (c)(2) of this section pertaining to the imposition of a reorganizationplan for failure to meet performance standards for two consecutive yearsdoes not apply to Title III. The Department will issue, in advance of eachprogram year, guidance on specific values for required standards.In addition, the provisions of Part 629, Subpart D, ``Grievances, Investigations,and Hearings,'' apply to Title III of JTPA. The provisions of various sectionsof this subpart have been changed to indicate that where provisions applyto SDA grant recipients, they also apply to Title III substate grantees.In addition to revisions and additions to administrative provisions, theseregulations contain a revised Part 631, which will replace all of existingPart 631 for programs beginning July 1, 1989. Following is a brief discussionof revised Part 631.Scope and PurposeSection 631.1 reflects the mandate of EDWAA to establish a new worker readjustmentprogram serving dislocated workers as part of the overall effort to increaseAmerican workers' skills, thereby improving American competitiveness intothe 21st Century.The new program seeks to establish an early readjustment capacity for workersand firms in each State; to provide comprehensive coverage to workers regardlessof the cause of dislocation; to provide early referral from the unemploymentinsurance system to adjustment services as an integral part of the adjustmentprocess; to foster labor, management and community partnerships with governmentin addressing worker dislocation; to emphasize retraining and reemploymentservices rather than income support; to create an ongoing substate capacityto deliver adjustment services; to tailor services to meet the needs ofindividuals; to improve accountability by establishing a system of mandatedperformance standards; to improve financial management by monitoring expendituresand reallotting available funds; and to provide the flexibility to targetfunds to the most critical dislocation problems.DefinitionsIn addition to definitions contained in sections 4, 301, and 303(e) ofthe Act, as amended, and andSection; 626.4 of the JTPA regulations, an additionaldefinition is added at andSection; 631.2 for ``substantial layoff.'' Thisnew definition is based upon the definition of ``mass layoff'' as containedin the recently enacted Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act,Pub. L. 100-379, 102 Stat. 890 (August 4, 1988).Participant EligibilitySection 631.3 sets forth participant eligibility criteria for Title III,including regulations required by section 301(a)(1)(D) of the Act, regardingeconomic conditions and natural disasters under which self-employed individualsare eligible for employment and training assistance. Certain sections whichprovided guidance on the eligibility of self-employed individuals havebeen eliminated in order to shorten and simplify these regulations.This section also indicates that services will be provided to displacedhomemakers under Title III only if the Governor determines that the servicesmay be provided without adversely affecting the delivery of services toeligible dislocated workers. Services provided to displaced homemakersshould be part of ongoing programs and activities authorized under TitleIII and not separate and discrete programs.Section 631.3 also sets forth the eligibility criteria for workers issueda certificate of continuing eligibility and the conditions of eligibilityfor dislocated workers not issued such certificates.Approved Training RuleSection 631.4 provides that participation by an eligible individual ina program authorized under Title III of the Act or Part 631 is deemed tobe acceptance of training with the approval of the State for the purposesof other Federal law relating to unemployment benefits.Allotment and Reallotment of Funds by the SecretarySection 631.11 provides for allotment of funds to States and to the Commonwealthof the Northern Mariana Islands and other territories and possessions ofthe United States.Section 631.12 provides for reallotment of unexpended funds. The revisedTitle III provides that the limitation on carryover of funds shall applyto the program year beginning July 1, 1988, but for that year only theamount available for reallotment is the amount equal to the amount by whichthe unexpended balance of the State formula allotment at the end of theprogram year exceeds 30 percent of the formula allotment. Thereafter, theamount will be the amount which exceeds 20 percent.Classification of Costs at State and Substate Levels Section 631.13 provides that for the new Title III program, all costs shallbe charged against one of the allowable cost categories. These categoriesapply only to the Title III program which becomes effective on July 1,1989. In the rapid response category, staff-related costs are chargeableonly to the extent that staff are engaged in rapid response activities;all other costs charged to this category must be solely for rapid responseactivities. This section also describes activities chargeable to administration.Limitations on Certain Costs Section 631.14 describes cost limitations applicable to Title III. TheGovernor is required to prescribe criteria under which substate granteesmay apply for a waiver to expend less than 50 percent (but not less than30 percent) of substate funds for training. Note that provisions of andSection; 629.39 have been revised to delete allreferences to Title III. Federal Reporting Requirements Section 631.15 describes reporting requirements applicable to Title III.In order to comply with new statutory requirements regarding federal oversightand mandatory reallotment, quarterly financial reporting will be requiredfor the first two program years. More frequent data collection will resultin a reduced need for actual reallotment in the initial years of the program.Complaints, Investigations and Penalties Section 631.16 provides, in accordance with the amended Title III, forinvestigation of complaints and for remedies in instances in which it isdetermined that the State plan is not followed. Federal by-pass Authority Section 631.18 describes the authority and the responsibilities of theSecretary in the exercise of Federal by-pass authority. Appeals Section 631.19 describes the appeal provisions for activities under TitleIII. Decisions on the designation of Title III substate grantees are notappealable to the Secretary. Needs-related Payments Section 631.20 both provides eligibility criteria for and establishes maximumweekly amounts for needs-related payments. Eligibility criteria addressboth workers who qualify for unemployment insurance and workers who donot qualify. Needs-related payments will be made only in accordance withthe State or substate plan and within cost limitations established at andSection;631.14. State Dislocated Worker Unit Section 631.30 provides for the designation or creation and functions ofthe State dislocated worker unit or office. While the regulations outlinethe activities of the State unit, the effective functioning of such anoffice is seen by the Department as the key element in a successful Stateemployment and training program for dislocated workers. Provision of rapidresponse is a major element in the overall responsibilities of this office,but key to the overall functioning of a successful program will be theauthority and responsibility to effectively coordinate services to affectedworkers, arranging for immediate services and providing technical assistanceto substate grantees. An important responsibility of the office will be the development and maintenanceof contacts with employee groups and the employer community, particularlyemployers in industries or locations which may be vulnerable to employmentloss. Close liaison with employee groups, employer organizations, chambersof commerce, State and local economic development agencies, private industrycouncils, veterans' service organizations and related organizations isessential. In instances in which a dislocation event occurs, the office must havethe capability to quickly approach the affected employer and workers andoffer initial services, including assistance in the establishment of labor-managementcommittees. It is essential that among the staff of such an office, there be individualswith experience and credibility in the employer and employee communitieswho can effectively work with employers and employees in difficult situations.Monitoring and Oversight Section 631.31 provides that the Governor is responsible for oversightof substate grantee activities. This is viewed as an important functionto assure that substate programs are operated in accordance with the Act,regulations, State plans and State guidance. Allocation of Funds by the Governor Section 631.32 provides for allocation of funds to substate areas by theGovernor. As provided in the amended legislation, the Governor shall prescribethe formula for substate planning allocations. Not less than 50 percentof the State allotment must be allocated by formula. The formula must useinformation on all six areas specified in andSection; 631.32(b)(1) and mayadd other elements as the State deems necessary and appropriate. The weightto be assigned to each element, be it a mandatory element or an elementdeveloped by the State, is to be determined by the Governor. If data alreadyexist that reflect the formula needs, new data need not be collected tomeet the requirements of this provision. This section also provides that the Governor may reserve up to 40 percentof the State allotment for State activities and for discretionary allocationto substate grantees. An additional 10 percent of the State allotment maybe reserved, to be allocated among substate grantees on the basis of needduring the first nine months of the program year. State Procedures for Identifying Funds Subject to Mandatory Federal ReallotmentSection 631.33 provides that the Governor must establish procedures identifyingfunds subject to mandatory reallotment. Such procedures may not exempteither State or substate funds from such consideration.Designation of Substate Areas Section 631.34 provides for designation of substate areas. The Act providesthat the Governor must designate as a substate area any JTPA service deliveryarea (SDA) with a population of 200,000 or more and any concentrated employmentprogram grantee. The Governor must also designate any two or more contiguousSDAs that in aggregate have a population of 200,000 or more and that requestdesignation unless the Governor determines that such a designation wouldbe consistent with the effective delivery of services or would be otherwiseinappropriate. Designation of Substate Grantees Section 631.35 provides for designation of substate grantees. Substategrantees will be selected through negotiations among the Governor, thePrivate Industry Council, and the local elected official. The regulationsprovide that when a substate area is represented by more than one electedofficial or PIC, they shall designate representatives who shall negotiatetogether with the Governor an agreement on designation of substate grantees.If, and only if, an agreement cannot be reached, the Governor will selectthe substate grantee. Decisions made on the designation of substate granteesare not matters appealable to the Secretary, in the same way that decisionson the designation of SDA grant recipients and administrative entitiesare not appealable to the Secretary. Biennial State Plan Section 631.36 provides for a biennial State plan which shall be developedin accordance with instructions issued by the Secretary. In accordancewith andSection; 631.70(c) the initial plan shall be for a period of oneyear. The initial plan shall then be modified to incorporate sections applicablefor the subsequent biennial period. Coordination Activities Section 631.37 describes the types of agencies and organizations with whichthe dislocated worker unit or office is to exchange information and coordinateprograms, activities and services. Coordination and effective use of informationand services between programs is essential to effective and successfulprogram administration. State By-pass Authority Section 631.38 describes the authority and responsibility of the Governorin the exercise of State by-pass authority. State Program Operational Plan Section 631.40 provides for submission biennially of a State program operationalplan which describes the activities, programs and projects to be accomplishedwith funds reserved by the Governor. It is envisioned that this will bea detailed operational plan and will contain specific activities and projects.Allowable State Activities Section 631.41 describes activities and services upon which funds reservedby the Governor may be expended. Substate Plan Section 631.50 describes procedures for development and submission of substateplans, for review and comment on such plans by the SJTCC, review and approvalby the Governor, and for appeals in the event of disapproval. Substateplans are submitted to the Governor and appeals are submitted to the Secretary,except in the case where the substate area is the State. In this instance,such plans are submitted to the Secretary and appeals of disapproval inwhole or in part are submitted to DOL's Office of Administrative Law Judges.Allowable Substate Program Activities Section 631.51 describes activities and services upon which funds allocatedto a substate area may be expended. Selection of Service Providers Section 631.52 indicates that the substate grantee has the responsibilityfor providing authorized Title III services within the substate area, pursuantto the approved plan. The substate grantee may provide such services directlyor may select service providers to do so. Certificates of Continuing Eligibility Section 631.53 provides for alternative methods by which substate granteesmay provide retraining services through issuance of certificates of continuingeligibility. Such certificates are effective for the period specified inthe certificate, not to exceed 104 weeks. It is envisioned that certificatesof continuing eligibility may be used in two distinct ways. First, workersmay receive a certificate and defer the beginning of retraining services.This will be particularly useful where dislocated workers opt for immediateemployment and defer a decision on retraining. Second, workers may usea certificate to obtain their own retaining services through alternativeservice providers approved by the substate grantee. Eligibility for dislocated workers not issued such certificates is coveredin andSection; 631.3. Implementation of the Regulations In accord with section 6305(f) of the OTCA, these regulations are effectiveon November 1, 1988, and are applicable to Fiscal Year 1989 appropriationsand to programs beginning July 1, 1989 and to actions, plans, and proceduresrequired at the Federal, State and substate levels to plan for and implementprograms beginning July 1, 1989. EDWAA specifically provides that funds appropriated for Fiscal Year 1989or any preceding year may be used for planning and implementation of theEDWAA amendments. Statutory requirements and regulations previously in effect for Title IIIcontinue to apply to pre-Fiscal Year 1989 funds and activities for ProgramYear 1988 and prior years except to the extent that the Secretary specificallyprovides for the use of such funds for implementation activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Publication as an Interim Rule </ITAG>This document is published as an interim final rule, with a 30-day commentperiod. EDWAA was enacted on August 23, 1988. Congress mandated in section6305(f) of EDWAA that the Secretary of Labor prescribe regulations implementingthe statute no later than November 1, 1988. Section 6305(c) EDWAA makesthe law's mandated membership changes for the State Job Training CoordinatingCouncils effective on January 1, 1980; and section 6305(a) of EDWAA makesthe law's revision of JTPA Title III effective on July 1, 1989. Due to the complexity of the task of revising the JTPA Title III regulations,the requirements of the rulemaking review process, the short statutorytimeframe for prescription of regulations, and the need to provide JTPArecipients with sufficient advance notice of the new regulations to preparefor implementation in 1989, the Department of Labor for good cause hasfound, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(B), that publication of a notice ofproposed rulemaking for these regulations is impracticable, unnecessary,and contrary to the public interest. On the same bases, the Departmenthas determined, pursuant to 5. U.S.C. 553(d)(3), that there is good causeto publish the interim final rule less than thirty days before its effectivedate. Nevertheless, the Department is requesting comments on the interim finalrule for thirty days after its publication, and plans to respond to thosecomments and publish a final rule prior to EDWAA's general effective dateof July 1, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>The interim final rule implements certain provisions of the Economic Dislocationand Worker Adjustment Assistance Act. As it would not have the financialor other impact to make it a major rule, preparation of a regulatory impactanalysis is unnecessary. See Executive Order No. 12291, 5 U.S.C. 601 note.The Department of Labor has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy,Small Business Administration, that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the rulewould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. No significant economic impact would be imposed by therule. Paperwork Reduction Act Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, all new information collectionrequirements imposed by these regulations will be submitted to the Officeof Management and Budget for approval.
