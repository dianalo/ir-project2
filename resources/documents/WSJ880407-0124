But not as fast as new rules specify if bankers have their way.    Financial institutions have deluged the Federal Reserve Board with complaints and are lobbying Congress in a last-ditch effort to loosen rules taking effect Sept. 1 that require banks, thrifts and credit unions to make deposited funds available within one, three or seven business days, depending on the type of check deposited.    For years, consumers have complained that financial institutions, trying to assure that funds are collectible, place unduly long holds on checks (except for certain personal and payroll checks). A 1986 survey by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Washington, D.C., found that 53% of 458 banks and savings and loan associations held local checks for three to five business days and that 76% held out-of-state checks for more than a week.    But in coming to the aid of depositors, bankers assert, Congress has taken away important defenses against fraud. One banker half-jokingly refers to the new law -- the Expedited Funds Availability Act -- as the Check-Kiters Enrichment Act, because institutions will have to make funds available in many cases before they know whether a check is collectible. On average, it takes 6.8 days for a bank to learn that a check is uncollectible.    Here's a scenario some bankers fear: A customer of a West Coast credit union deposits a $6,000 certified check drawn on a big New York bank. Because of the time difference, the New York bank has closed, making verification impossible until the next day. But under the new law, funds on certified and government checks must be available for withdrawal the next business day, which is when the customer takes out his money. Only later does the credit union learn the check is counterfeit.    Even under the present law, variations of this scam have occurred. Robert Hutchinson, vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York, says, &quot;If dishonest people have found ways to cheat banks under the current law, what is the potential for fraud under this new law?&quot;    Consumer activists counter that banks haven't demonstrated that fraud is a serious threat. If financial institutions are truly worried about fraud, they should speed up the check-return system rather than saddle consumers with lengthy delays, the activists argue.    Automation and special couriers have shortened the time it takes a check to get from the depositor's bank to the payer's bank -- to a day and a half on average. But the process of returning insufficient checks to the institutions where they were deposited is far slower, requiring 10 days or longer for 15% of returned bad checks.    Returns of bad checks are lengthy because of their comparatively low volume and labor-intensive nature. Each year, only 1% of checks are returned for insufficient funds, but they total about $47 billion. Adding to the delay, institutions choose to return them by mail rather than special courier. And as anyone who has ever examined the bank stamps on a canceled check can attest, it can be difficult to tell where the check was initially deposited. Consequently, the process is done by hand rather than machine.    The Fed is considering steps to speed up the return of insufficient-funds checks. Paul M. Connolly, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, says, &quot;A likely outcome is that there are going to be a number of improvements made to the return process.&quot;    Bankers say, however, that the potential for fraud under the new law isn't limited to bad checks. For instance, they point to the problems posed by automated teller machines. A customer could claim to be depositing $500 cash at an ATM and actually deposit nothing. Under the availability schedule of the new law, the customer could withdraw $500 the next business day before the bank has had a chance to verify the deposit, bankers argue.    Consumer activists say that banks can resolve that problem by speeding up their verification procedures. In addition, they say that the new law also allows financial institutions eight days to make funds available in new accounts and an added four days on deposits in excess of $5,000, on accounts with repeated overdrafts or on checks of dubious collectibility.    Bankers complain that the exceptions need to be broader. For example, they want to lengthen the time an account is considered new, to 90 days from 30 days. New accounts are the ones most frequently involved in fraud, they say. And bankers want leeway to make ATM deposits available only after two business days.    Bankers say the rule permitting longer holds on checks greater than $5,000 doesn't apply to government and cashier's checks. And with recent advances in photocopying technology, counterfeit checks are becoming a bigger headache, bankers assert. Holding government and cashier's checks longer would allow them to be studied more carefully to determine whether they are counterfeit, bankers say.    Some of the protection in the new law is illusory, bankers say. For example, the provision that allows an extended hold for doubtful collectibility can be used only if a bank tells a depositor that it suspects fraud or insolvency. Marcia Z. Sullivan of the Consumer Bankers Association, an Arlington, Va., trade group, says this protection is no more than a fig leaf: &quot;No bank is going to tell a depositor that it thinks he is involved in a check-kiting scheme or is going bankrupt.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
