The information company also cited the impact of anexpired contract on its Donnelley Directory operations.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, directors declared a 6% increase in thequarterly dividend to 53 cents a share from 50 cents, payableJune 8 to stock of record May 18.   Financial analysts said they expected the results, whichthe company had been clearly signaling. Yesterday, Dun andamp;Bradstreet reiterated a forecast of 1990 per-share earningsof about $2.80, indicating an 11% decline from 1989's $3.14 ashare.   In the quarter, net income totaled $110.3 million, or 60cents a share, down from $143.3 million, or 77 cents a share,the year earlier. Revenue rose 8.5% to $1.15 billion from$1.1 billion. The company noted, however, that the gain wasonly 4% after adjusting for the acquisition of ManagementScience America, a software concern, and the divestiture ofThomas Cook Travel.   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York StockExchange, Dandamp;B closed unchanged at $47.125 a share, down 12.5cents.   The earnings drop &quot;was due in part to a decrease inrevenue at U.S. Credit Services and substantial increase incosts&quot; to revamp the operations, the company said. Thecompany added that world-wide revenue for credit servicesdeclined, largely because of a &quot;high-single-digit&quot; drop infirst-quarter revenue of U.S. credit services. A spokesmandeclined to elaborate.   Last year, many customers accused Dun andamp; Bradstreetsalespeople of misleading them to buy far more creditservices than the company knew were needed. The company hasconceded that, in some cases, customers were abused. Inaddition, without admitting any wrongdoing, the companyreached an $18 million agreement to settle five majorlawsuits that similarly alleged customers were oversoldservices through deceit. As part of the settlement, thecompany agreed to modify its business practices in severalimportant respects. And it was those changes that accountedfor substantial cost increases in the credit servicesbusiness.   In the wake of the controversy, sales growth of creditservices has been weak, but Dun andamp; Bradstreet's profit hadcontinued to increase until the first quarter.   Dun andamp; Bradstreet revenue for its directory informationservices fell 21% to $90.3 million from $114.3 million theyear earlier because of the absence of revenue from aDonnelley directory contract and the timing of revenue fromyellow pages directories.   In other highlights, the company said, revenue grew 12% inmarketing information services, 5.8% in financial informationservices and 30% in business services.</TEXT></DOC>
