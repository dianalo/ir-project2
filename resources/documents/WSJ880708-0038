Yesterday, a Navy spokesman said the Navy's review of the contracts likely would be completed as early as today, and &quot;the projection is it will affect few, if any, of these contracts.&quot;    Under pressure from Congress to react to the unfolding scandal, the Pentagon last Friday said that payments on nine Navy electronics programs would be halted because recently released court papers suggested that the programs were tainted by fraud and bribery. The papers related to a federal criminal investigation that relied heavily on wiretaps of defense consultants and Pentagon officials.    But in its own review, one Navy official said, the Navy hasn't found any firm evidence of bid-rigging or inside-information dealing by companies involved in the nine programs affected by its payments ban. It isn't likely to learn much more about the case soon, since federal prosecutors and the FBI aren't sharing information they have gathered with the Pentagon. The criminal inquiry is likely to go on for months before any indictments are handed down.    Separately, however, Varian Associates, a relatively small contractor based in Palo Alto, Calif., said the Navy notified it yesterday that its Continental Electronics unit was suspended from doing future business with the Pentagon and other government agencies. The Navy's action, which had been expected, came in response to a filing last month in U.S. District Court in Dallas in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it believed that a Continental vice president engaged in a criminal scheme with a defense consultant to funnel electronics work to the unit.    The announcement last Friday that payments were being suspended on the nine programs sent shock waves through the defense industry, since it appeared to set a precedent for similar tough actions once details on more of the roughly 85 contracts under investigation come to light.    A Navy spokesman reported that no payments on any of the contracts actually had been halted as a result of last Friday's order because no requests for payments had been made since the payments ban was announced. He added that an internal review of the nine programs had shown that contracts hadn't even been awarded on three of them.    Still, the announcement appears to have resulted in great confusion. Some companies identified last week by the Pentagon as subject to a payments-suspension said they already had completed work on contracts that supposedly were frozen. And others said they hadn't even won the contracts in question.    Pentagon officials themselves conceded they had considerable trouble identifying the contractors involved in the various programs. &quot;There's been a lot of thrashing going on around here about what to do without a concrete plan on what to do,&quot; said one Pentagon official.    Another said that the Pentagon's top administrators, in reacting to the scandal, wanted to appear bold, but &quot;they hadn't thought through&quot; their actions.    Contractors, for their part, complained about getting conflicting signals from the Pentagon.    According to an official from Raytheon Corp., for instance, a Navy office had assured the company that it wouldn't be affected by the halt in payments on UYQ-21 aviation displays. But a procurement official in the office of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said the company was subject to the cutoff.    A spokesman for Hughes Aircraft Co., the other company cited by the Pentagon in connection with the aviation-display contract, said that the company hadn't been involved in the current investigation. And, echoing a number of other contractors, he said Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp. hadn't been notified of any cut-off of payments.    A Pentagon official said that Gould Inc. will be temporarily shut out of the bidding for a new radio system known as &quot;Bancroft.&quot; Gould officials, however, say the company dropped the project months ago and isn't interested in resuming the work.    In addition, the Pentagon had included among the contracts it said were suspended a $51 million award to ITT Corp. for fiber-optic equipment switches and radios. But an ITT spokesman, Jim Gallagher, said the suspension &quot;would have no impact&quot; because the work on the contract &quot;had already been performed and we have already been paid.&quot;    Mr. Gallagher said there is confusion at ITT about the suspension, &quot;which is heightened because up until this time we haven't been involved in the inquiry.&quot; He added, &quot;We haven't been subpoenaed or served with search warrants.&quot;    Similarly, Unisys Corp. spokesman Peter Hynes disputed the Pentagon's statement that the company was involved in another suspended program involving development of an Anti-Submarine Warfare Operating Center for the Navy. &quot;We were bidding on the contract, but we didn't win it, therefore the suspension had no impact on us,&quot; he said.    Lockheed Corp.'s missiles and space company had been selected to make an oceanographic computer system known as TESS. It was told a contract would be signed last Friday. Instead it got a call saying that the transaction was on hold.    According to a Lockheed official in Austin, Texas, where the equipment would have been made, the company hasn't had any dealing with two consultants alleged to have had inside information on the TESS competition. A contractor that lost is believed to have hired one of them as a consultant. </TEXT></DOC>
