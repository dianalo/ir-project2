Disappointment over President Bush's budget proposals was citedas another factor in today's losses.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average skidded 15.54 to2,307.50 by noon EST. Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by nearly3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.   Sellers took over after the Labor Department reported wholesaleprices skyrocketed at an annual rate of 12.7 percent in January, thebiggest monthly surge in more than three years.   The government said the steepest increase in food prices in ayear combined with the largest rise in energy prices in two years topush up the Producer Price Index 1.0 percent last month. It was thebiggest increase since an identical surge in October 1985.   ``The number was much larger than anyone expected,'' saidElizabeth G. Reiners, a vice president for money market research atDean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Traders were concerned that the Federal Reserve, seeing the surgein producer prices, would drive interest rates higher to try tocorral inflation.   In the credit markets, today's inflation report deepenedThursay's losses, which followed a disappointing Treasury bondauction.   The Treasury's 30-year bond sank nearly ~ point, or about $8.75per each $1,000 in face value, after having fallen 1| points onWednesday. The bond's yield soared to 9.07 percent from 8.89 percentlate Wednesday.   But the inflation report was bullish for the dollar, which tendsto rise on speculation that the Fed will tighten credit. Higher U.S.interest rates make the dollar more attractive to foreign buyers.   In New York, the dollar rose after the report was released. Atmidday, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.8605 West Germanmarks, up from 1.8475 late Thursday, and at 128.45 Japanese yen, upfrom 127.93 late Thursday.   On Wall Street, some investors were disappointed by Bush's budgetmessage Thursday night, saying it didn't live up to hopes that itwould contain forceful new ideas about how to straighten out thegovernment's budget.   There also was concern about Bush's plans on foreign markets. Thedollar declined in early trading overseas and prices fell sharply onLondon's stock exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
