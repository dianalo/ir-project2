Crocker's meeting with Roelof ``Pik'' Botha next week at anunspecified European location also will give the United States anopportunity to ``register concern'' about recent developments inSouth Africa, spokeswoman Anita Stockman said. The United Stateshas complained about anti-dissent measures proposed in South Africain the past few weeks.   A State Department working group arrived in Angola on Wednesdayto explore the possibility of further talks on getting theestimated 40,000 Cuban troops out of the country as part of anoverall settlement, Stockman said.   Since he took office in 1981, Crocker has been seeking tonegotiate a withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola in return forSouth African withdrawal from neighboring Namibia.   The Cuban troops have been battling a powerful guerrilla force,UNITA, which is backed by South African and U.S. assistance.   In what appeared to be a major breakthrough when Crocker was inAngola in January, Cuba declared its willingness in principle topull the troops out of the country, but the overall settlement thatwould bring that about is still to be arranged.   Angola has said South African willingness to participate in thenegotiations _ and abide by a United Nations resolution givingindependence to Namibia _ is a necessary ingredient of a settlement.   Stockman said Crocker's meeting with Botha will ``afford anopportunity to reassess South Africa's willingness to proceedtoward a settlement involving total Cuban troop withdrawal fromAngola and Namibian independence based on U.N. Security Councilresolution 435.''   Crocker also is expected to restate U.S. demands for a cessationof cross border forays by South African troops and concern about anew crackdown on groups seeking more rights for the country's blackmajority.   Last month, the government outlawed the political activities of17 anti-apartheid organizations. The government has also introducedlegislation to bar a wide range of organizations from receivingforeign funds.   Foreign governments and private agencies send millions ofdollars in assistance to these groups as a way of aiding SouthAfricans without sending funds to their government.</TEXT></DOC>
