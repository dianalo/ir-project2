Preliminary figures for 50 of the nation's 100 largest farmcooperatives show that total revenues in 1988, despite drought,rose by 9 percent and that profits, or net margins, were up 28percent from 1987.   Michael D. Kane, an economist for the department's AgriculturalCooperative Service, said also that co-ops last year showed a``significant 6 percent decline in long-term debt'' and put greaterreliance on cooperative bank financing.   ``In somewhat dramatic fashion, farmer cooperatives continuedtheir recovery from the agricultural recession of the 1980s,'' Kanewrites in the current issue of Farmer Cooperatives magazine.   The 9 percent growth business last year pushed estimated totalrevenues of the top 100 co-ops to nearly $46.9 billion. But thatwas still far short of the record level of around $58 billion setin 1981 before the slump began.   ``Drought-induced higher commodity prices brought greatermarketing revenues on reduced volume while farm supply sales andvolume also improved,'' Kane said.   Marketing co-ops, those that handle grain and other commoditiesfor farmers, had sales estimated at more than $33 billion, up 6percent from 1987.   ``Most farm supply cooperatives report growth in overall sales,particularly fertilizer,'' he said. ``Fertilizer sales among thetop 100 are estimated to increase more than $900 million in 1988because higher domestic and export tonnage drove up total dollarsales.''   Looking at profit sheets, Kane said net margins to the top 100co-ops last year were estimated at more than $920 million,accounting for the 28 percent increase from $717.3 million in 1987.   ``Net margins would have topped the billion-dollar mark exceptfor major losses in petroleum refinery operations,'' he said.``Regardless, net margins are expected to reach their highest levelsince 1980.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's okay to clean up the environment, justdon't do it at the expense of hungry people, says Orville L.Freeman, president of the Agriculture Council of America.   ``There is danger that these needs of the hungry will beobscured while the affluent 10 percent of the world looks for abroad brush and quick fix to environmental problems that have beendecades in the making,'' he said at a recent conference on futureglobal problems.   ``In our haste to atone for environmental sins of the past, wemust not delude ourselves about the realities of the future,''Freeman said. ``We must guide the world to a technology that meetsthe need of both humanity and the environment.''   The council is a private, non-profit organization based inWashington. It represents all segments of agriculture andfrequently concentrates on trade and world issues that affectAmerican farmers and consumers.   Freeman, a former governor of Minnesota, was secretary ofagriculture during the 1960s in the Kennedy and Johnsonadministrations.   ``The estimated population growth for the next quarter-centuryis so enormous that warning bells should be sounding in everyquadrant of the globe,'' Freeman said. ``Feeding this populationmay very well be the greatest challenge we have ever faced _ onethat will test the world's productive and technologicalcapabilities to their very limits.''   Freeman said that projections show the world's population willincrease by more than 1 billion people to 6.2 billion by the turnof the century and to nearly 11 billion by 2050.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japanese farmers are finding it cheaper toimport hay and other forage than to grow it themselves.   A report by the Agriculture Department says Japan's strong yenis a major reason that forage imports are so cheap.   ``In addition, Japanese farmers are importing higher qualityforages in an effort to increase the fat content of their fluidmilk production,'' the report in the department's ForeignAgriculture magazine said. ``A new support price mechanism requireshigher fat content in milk for qualification of support payments.''   Finally, it said, there is less rice straw available because ofJapan's rice land diversion program, and rainy weather has reduceddomestic roughage supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
