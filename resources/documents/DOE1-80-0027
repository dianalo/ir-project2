Thesymptoms of this group of cancers are nonspecific and are readily mistakenby both the patient and the primary care physician for upper respiratoryinfections or inflammations of the sinuses. By the time cancer is suspectedand the diagnosis is established, several bony walls will have been breachedand the anatomic site of origin may no longer be clear. To be successful,treatment often must include eradication of cancer near to or infiltratingcritical normal organs or tissues. Radiation therapy has acquired itsposition in the management of these patients because of its potentialfor at least partial sparing of these critical tissues. There are fivebasic techniques available for irradiating cancers of the nasal fossaand paranasal sinuses. The optimal technique varies with the size, shape,and location of the volume requiring irradiation and the anticipatedtolerances of associated normal structures.</TEXT></DOC>
