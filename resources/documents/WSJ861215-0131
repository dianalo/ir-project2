As previously reported, San Mateo, Calif.-based Spinner Corp. began in late September a $12-a-share, or $106 million, offer for the 88% of Princeville's 8.8 million shares outstanding that Spinner didn't already own or have an option to acquire.    Last month, a federal judge in Honolulu found that Spinner &quot;intentionally and fraudulently&quot; violated disclosure rules by concealing in SEC filings that other interests were seeking to acquire Princeville in concert with Spinner, a former Utah shell company. For the same reason, the judge also said that Spinner's tender offer to Princeville shareholders was &quot;false and misleading.&quot;    As a result of the judge's finding, the court temporarily blocked Spinner's offer. A hearing on whether the injunction should be made permanent is scheduled for Dec. 22.    Princeville, a real estate and resort concern, said it is &quot;gratified&quot; by and cooperating fully with the SEC inquiry.    Stephen Kircher, Spinner's president, said: &quot;We're aware that there is an informal inquiry by the SEC. But they haven't contacted Spinner. . . . So I'm not sure whether they're investigating us or Princeville.&quot; Mr. Kircher said he &quot;isn't unhappy&quot; the SEC is investigating the situation, and added, &quot;I hope they take a good hard look at the court's finding.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
