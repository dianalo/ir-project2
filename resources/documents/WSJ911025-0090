Since the June 1989 election, when Solidarity rolled intopower through the first big crack in the Soviet empire, thePoles have made do with a diluted democracy. A deal struckwith the Communists before revolution transformed EasternEurope gave them an undeserved 65% of the seats inParliament's powerful lower house.</LP><TEXT>   Lech Walesa became president in a free election last year,though Communists kept on hobbling the efforts ofSolidarity-rooted governments to install a market economy.With this vote, the old system's political rubble can at lastbe cleared; the Communists don't stand a chance.   But the voters aren't cheering. As far as they can makeout, a new jumble of conflict and confusion has replaced theCommunists, and the journey to capitalism won't get anysmoother. Jacek Maziarski, chairman of the Center Alliance,likens the Polish mood on the coming of full democracy tothat of &quot;a child who dreams of a bicycle and gets it at theage of 70.&quot; The Democratic Union's secretary-general, PiotrNowina-Konopka, is more positive. Only 6% voted in the firstelection after the French Revolution, he notes, and Franceseems to have come out all right.   Indeed, if the many offshoots of Solidarity, some of whichdiffer more over personalities than policies, can unite afterthis election, Poland's market push could get back on track.If a new constitution can strengthen the roll of PresidentWalesa, some suggest, Parliament's power to block governmentprograms may wane.   But in the jockeying for votes, nobody has told this tothe electorate. With 250 parties and an average of 16candidates for each of 460 seats, they are confused. Partieswith a pinch of popular recognition are understandably aheadin the polls.   The front runner, at 20%, is the Democratic Union, lead byformer Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who resigned afterlosing a nasty fight with Mr. Walesa for the presidency. Buteven if the party wins, its strategists probably won'tpromote him for prime minister again; they say it takes himtoo long to make decisions.   Prime Minister Bielecki, who was appointed by Mr. Walesato take Mr. Mazowiecki's place, has become one of thecountry's most popular names. He leads a free-market partycalled the Liberal Democratic Congress, a fact that seems tohave escaped the electorate.   &quot;People don't know he belongs to our party,&quot; says partyspokesman Andrzej Halicki. &quot;Our task is to tell them that heis a member.&quot;   The flashiest name in the election is that of Solidarityitself, whose red logo splashes across posters saying: &quot;Thereare 100 parties, but only one Solidarity.&quot;   But Solidarity crumbled as a political movement in 1989and bequeathed its logo to a trade union. Now the union isunhappy with Poland's economic austerity and is runningcandidates of its own. Yet even if its candidates do well,the union insists they won't join any new government.   &quot;We limit our program to representing employees,&quot; saysMariusz Ambroziak, the young head of Solidarity's Warsawelection office.   Meanwhile, the least comprehensible vote-getter isn'trunning at all.   &quot;Party X&quot; was founded by businessman Stan Tyminski, whoflew in from his home in Canada last year and knocked Mr.Mazowiecki out of the presidential election.   Mr. Tyminski never has been able to make clear exactlywhat his party stands for. Some suspect him of being aspoiler snuck in by the old regime. In any case, Party X wasfound to have falsified signatures on its petitions in thiselection, and it failed to qualify. Mr. Tyminski flew back toCanada in a huff.   Poland's most comprehensible vote-getter, the RomanCatholic Church, has a gaggle of parties running in its name.Their programs are clear: against abortion and in favor ofChristian values in the new constitution. Despite pep talksfrom the pulpit, however, they aren't getting much moresupport in the polls than ex-Communists -- less than 10% in acountry where more than 90% of the people professCatholicism.   &quot;It will wreck the myth of church domination overpolitics,&quot; says political commentator Kostek Gebert. &quot;Poleswill no longer fear what the church will do to them if theydon't comply.&quot;   If the polls hold true, that may be the one concreteresult to emerge from Polish democracy's greatest day. Yetthe surrounding confusion masks one thing that may well makeSunday a great day for democracy: an underlying unity amongall the parties whose members once worked together to bringdown communism.   Every one of them agrees that Poland needs a functioningmarket economy, created with the most possible speed and theleast possible pain. This is the first Polish election, andprobably the first in Eastern Europe, in which no one with achance to win is challenging that goal.   &quot;It's one of the comforts of the political process here,&quot;says a Western banker who has moved to Warsaw.</TEXT></DOC>
