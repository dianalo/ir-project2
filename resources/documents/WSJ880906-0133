The official, Eddy F. Fernandez, was convicted Friday on four counts of conspiracy and misapplying the funds, which prosecutors said were to be used to pay the criminal defense bill of Miguel Recarey Jr., International Medical's former president.    Mr. Fernandez faces as much as 25 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Mr. Recarey, also indicted in the case, is a fugitive.    Mr. Fernandez's lawyer couldn't be reached for comment. A top Medicare official testified at the trial that government funds to International Medical, once the nation's largest Medicare-approved health-maintenance organization, went down a &quot;rat hole.&quot;    International Medical received nearly $1 billion in Medicare funds from 1981 until last year, when it collapsed amid charges of influence peddling and mismanagement. An article that appeared last month in The Wall Street Journal outlined Mr. Recarey's longstanding ties to organized crime and foreign intelligence. </TEXT></DOC>
