<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0447 </DOCNO><TEXT>A mathematical model is described for the hydraulics calculation of waterdistribution in the natural draught cooling towers for the Temelin nuclearpower plant. The model allows determining the form of the mechanicalenergy curve along the asbestos cement pipe and the main distributiontrough, the form of the pressure curve in the pipe and the form of thelevel in an open trough, the cross section velocities in the individualdistribution network sections, and the flow through nozzles, i.e., theactual distribution over the tower surface of specific load due to coolingwater. The values are suggested of coefficients for calculations of lossesdue to friction, of local losses, and of outlet coefficients obtainedfrom the results of original studies and completed with literature data.The computer program is written in the Fortran 77 language.
