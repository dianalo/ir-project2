SullivanandM;When IBM's newest midrange computer, the AS/400, was released last year,industry participants applauded its PC Support file-transfer and emulationsoftware.andP;  Many predicted, however, that the improved file-transfercapabilities would hurt the third-party software market that providesemulation of 5250 terminals, which connect to System/3X and AS/400 machines.andM;Even though a large number of System/3X users have made the move to theAS/400, the strong demand for third-party connectivity solutions is holdingsteady.andP;  Now, contrary to early expectations of a slowdown in the 5250emulation-board and software market, vendors and analysts are saying that theAS/400 and its PC Support software are in fact fueling the third-partymarket.andM;A survey by analysts at market-research firm International Data Corp. (IDC)in Framingham, Mass., estimates that by the end of this year, 50 percent ofSystem/3X users will have moved to AS/400 machines, creating a huge marketfor AS/400 compatibility.andM;The reason vendors and analysts had initially predicted that AS/400 PCSupport would harm the third-party software market was because, unlike theSystem/ 3X PC Support package, the AS/400 PC Support software talks directlyto the emulation hardware.andP;  Physical links to PCs through local Token-Ringnetwork and twin-axial cable connections are needed to improve the limitedconnectivity abilities of the System/3X models.andP;  For the first time, an IBMminicomputer can recognize, and talk directly to, a PC.andM;The AS/400 PC Support software, which is installed on the AS/400, includesshared folders, which allow users to store PC text files and applications onthe AS/400 as if they were stored on a local PC.andP;  Thus, data can be shared,converted and transferred between PC and AS/400 applications.andM;On the PC side of IBM's AS/400-to-PC connectivity solution is the AdapterHandler, a low-level software driver that allows the PC to download theAS/400 interface software.andP;  A workstation function in AS/400 PC Support letsa PC run a combination of as many as five AS/400 display and printer sessionsconcurrently.andP;  Its virtual-printing feature lets PC users send filestransparently to an AS/400 for printing and enables AS/400 users to employPC-attached printers.andM;According to some users and 5250 emulation-board vendors, IBM has left enoughholes in its AS/400-to-PC connectivity solution to keep the third-partymarket thriving.andM;Since AS/400 PC Support is not compatible with System/3X terminal-emulationboards, third-party vendors must write Adapter Handler-like device driversfor their 5250 cards.andP;  And many vendors are adding host software that buildsupon the features of the AS/400 PC Support program.andM;In addition, the AS/400 PC Support program is extremely memory-intensive,according to Allison Cole, director of marketing for Emerald Technology Inc.,andO;a manufacturer of terminal-emulation boards in Bothell, Wash.andM;&quot;The price tag associated with running PC Support is high, since an EMS[Expanded-Memory Specification] board is generally needed in each PC,&quot; shesaid.andM;Other 5250 emulation-product vendors agreed.andP;  &quot;What the market initiallythought was, 'There goes the third-party products.' But PC Support opened upopportunities for us once users discovered the required memory and cost peruser,&quot; said Cathy Eftimiou, product manager of midrange communicationproducts at IDEAssociates Inc. in Billerica, Mass.andM;According to IBM officials, a twin-axial-attached PC requires 349K bytes ofRAM when using the word-processing functions in AS/400 Office software on onedisplay session with one virtual printer and shared folders.andP;  The requiredmemory jumps to 390K bytes when transferring files, the officials added.andM;Firms such as Emerald Technology and KMW Systems Corp. market substitutepackages for AS/400 PC Support that require less memory.andP;  Emerald's EmulationTransfer Utility (ETU), for example, requires only 95K bytes of memory on thePC, said Cole.andM;The $950 program is also less expensive than IBM's AS/400 PC Support, whichranges in price from $1,310 to $13,100, depending on the processor.andM;For many users, however, AS/400 PC Support's features are worth the high costof the additional memory required.andP;  &quot;Even on the [System] 38, we liked PCSupport better because [although] it has a high memory overhead, it was themost efficient.andP;  That's even more true on the AS/400,&quot; said Michael Phillips,data-processing manager at the Washington State Liquor Control Board inOlympia.andP;  Although Phillips uses 5250 terminal-emulation boards from ASTResearch Inc. and Bluelynx, he opted for PC Support on the AS/400.andM;Third-party vendors have traditionally set themselves apart from IBM byexpanding upon IBM's terminal-emulation features.andP;  IDEAssociates, forexample, offers 5250 gateway and resource-sharing products, in addition tolocal and remote terminal emulation.andM;IDEAssociates also began shipping an OS/2 Presentation Manager version of itsIdeacomm 5250 terminal-emulation software earlier this month.andP;  Features suchas 132-column support, windowing capabilities, support for six types ofterminals and virtual printing on four printers are among those capabilitiesthat set this product apart from IBM's offering, said Eftimiou.andM;Third-party emulation-board vendors are also beginning to offerAS/400-to-Macintosh connectivity support, something IBM does not offer.andM;KMW Systems, in Austin, Texas, markets a $995 TwinAxcess emulation card andsoftware package that provides a direct local connection to the AS/400twin-axial cabling from the Macintosh II.andM;In addition, IDEAssociates markets 5250 emulation boards for the Mac II andSE computers.andM;The myriad solutions offered by third-party firms for connecting PCs toAS/400 machines also contribute to the staying power of this market.andP;  Userscan choose between local 5250 emulation cards, protocol converters, remoteboards and even gateways.andM;Mux Lab Inc., a manufacturer of terminal-emulation products in Montreal,recently brought its 5250 LAN gateway to U.S.andP;  markets.andM;Installed on a non-dedicated LAN server, EMLGate allows as many as sevenpeople on a LAN to emulate the AS/400 terminal, said Faissal Damaj, productmanager at Mux Lab.andM;The EMLGate board is based on a Motorola 68000 chip, which contributes to ahigh overall system performance, according to Damaj.andM;Protocol converters are a less expensive, although less functional,alternative to emulation boards.andP;  KMW's TwinAxcess Series II twin-axial-cableprotocol converters, for example, convert AS/400 twin-axial-cabletransmissions into transmissions that the Mac and PC can receive througheither standard, parallel or serial cable.andP;  The $3,595 Series II convertercan connect as many as seven PCs and printers to an AS/400.andM;Customer interaction is another reason why third-party vendors are beingsought for AS/400 connectivity solutions.andP;  &quot;I'm impressed with [Bluelynx's]support.andP;  When I run into snags, Bluelynx has a technical staff that divesinto the problem,&quot; said John Trygstand, manager of information systems forAG-Chem Equipment Co., a manufacturer of chemical machinery in Minneapolis.andM;Janine Filion, vice president of sales for Bluelynx, a division of MicroIntegration Corp. in Cumberland, Md., agreed with Trygstand.andP;  &quot;The trend isthat if you offer an emulation program, you must go beyond the basic featuresif you want to compete,&quot; she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
