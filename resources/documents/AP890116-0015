The old divisions so familiar to world affairs _ East-West,North-South, First World-Third World _ have given way to a bafflingnew array of converging interests.   Diplomats seasoned by the Cold War and the anti-colonial winds ofchange watched the five-day meeting in amazement.   The Soviets, clear winners in the charm category, tweaked theAmericans for a lack of openness. The Americans aimed their ire at afriendly foe, West Germany.   Western allies fought openly over which of their companies soldchemicals to Iraq, Libya and Syria, all regarded as past orpotential users of poison gas.   Romania bolted its bloc, taking a position directly opposed tothe Kremlin's. A Soviet official merely smiled philosophically as heexplained that the Romanians refused to follow orders.   While chief Soviet delegate Viktor Karpov beamed benignly at thecameras, U.S. correspondents aimed barbs at his Americancounterpart. Retired Gen. William Burns, head of the U.S. armscontrol agency, admitted not knowing about new chemical warheadsincluded in the U.S. budget made public, by coincidence, during theconference.   Iran, whose representatives spoke eloquent English, stood firmwith the industrial West against Middle Eastern states one U.S.delegate described privately as ``the whackos.''   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati echoed points made by theUnited States, the ``Great Satan,'' demanding in measured terms evenmore sanctions and condemnation of past acts than the Americanswanted.   Although nations of the so-called non-aligned movement expressedtoken solidarity with the Arab League, hard-line Arabs had to backoff linking bans on chemical and nuclear weapons for lack of realsupport.   ``We're not buying that Arab League garbage,'' a Central Americandelegate said in private. ``You can't talk about a Third World andmean anything.''   Black Africans walked out again on R.F. Botha, the South Africanforeign minister, but this time Botha tossed away his speech anddramatically challenged them to admit in public their secretfriendship with his country.   Botha spoke of vaccines, health care, research and other aid hiscountry provided, and asserted: ``My African brothers know this.''   He noted that agreements finally had been reached on independencefor Namibia and South African withdrawal from Angola. Black Africansdid not walk when those matters were settled, he said.   ``We say no to hypoprisy,'' commented Foreign Minister Simeon Akeof Ivory Coast, the only black African to keep his seat. ``At leastit gave Botha a chance to reveal his contacts.''   Under the ironies were signs of a world turning faster than manyof its statesmen can measure.   William Waldegrave, junior minister in Britain's Foreign Office,shrugged off the old distinctions in a chat with reporters: ``I amalways confused over who is supposed to be First World or ThirdWorld when you start talking about rich Middle Eastern states.''   Most political analysts interviewed said the 109 speeches andsecret negotiations showed old-style international dealings arepoorly suited to a modern world.   Countries condemned for spraying nerve gas on civilianpopulations directed the same rhetoric at chemical weapons as thethose attacked.   Everyone knew up to 30 nations at the meeting had chemicalweapons but only the United States and the Soviet Union admittedhaving them. France, the host and arbiter of the moral tone, deniedit firmly, despite the intelligence of its allies to the contrary.   ``The problem,'' one Western analyst put it, ``is that you can'treally say what you think: that there are responsible leaders andmaniacs, and no international convention can differentiate amongthem.''   Several American delegates acknowledged that, despite the generaltone and circuitous phrasing, their underlying concerns werespecific:   _Iraq had used poison gas to turn the tide of war against Iranand to terrorize its own Kurdish minority. Some other states seemedimpressed by their success.   _Syria had chemical warheads on Scud missiles directed at Israel,each capable of delivering deadly gas over a radius of a thousandyards.   _Libya, helped by private West German companies among others, wascompleting a chemical weapons plant that could deliver toxicchemical agents to a broad range of terrorists.   The Americans' concurrent goal, to focus attention on a newthreat from Libyan leader Moammer Gadhafi, backfired by uniting theArab League. A night of compromises produced a declaration with nomention of sanctions, export controls or verification.   Lessons of the conference extended well beyond the subject athand. Mainly, the old cliches and timeworn roles were falling away.   At one point, a U.S. press officer introduced an Americanreporter to an arms negotiator who answered a broad range ofquestions, with hardly a pause to consider the implications of hisremarks.   Unlike most Americans at the meeting, the man was perfectlywilling to be quoted. He was a Russian.   Later, an American negotiator agreed with a point his Sovietrival had made, that the conference declaration was a politicaldocument with little specific or technical value.   ``That's what we would say, if we could,'' he said, but explainedthat statements had to be cleared in Washington and some subjectswere extremely sensitive. Then he added:   ``But don't quote me.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Mort Rosenblum has reported for The AssociatedPress for more than 20 years from Africa, Southeast Asia, LatinAmerica and Europe.
