The new forecast is in Boeing's just-released Current MarketOutlook, which it publishes each year. The report applies to thecommercial jet industry as a whole and is not limited to Boeingaircraft.   The dollar value is 24.6 percent above last year's estimate of$414 billion, while the estimated number of aircraft has grown by1,509 from the 6,908 forecast in the 1988 report.   Jack Howard, Boeing Commercial Airplanes director of marketresearch, said the revised estimates are based on prolonged airtravel growth fueled by continued growth in discretionary income andthe decrease in the real cost of travel after allowing forinflation. The report predicts relatively stable fuel prices and norecession for the foreseeable future.   About 70 percent of the new planes will be needed for growth intraffic, the report said, with the rest to replace aircraft goingout of service.   While some industry analysts believe replacement sales willaccelerate because of concerns over aging aircraft, Howard said thatmaintaining current fleets might be less expensive for airlines.Replacement with new jets could drive up operating costs andtherefore the cost to the public, which could slow air travelgrowth, he said.   Boeing estimates that on average, airlines replace jets after 28years, while others use a 25-year estimate. Howard said Boeing hadpredicted that 250 to 300 planes would be retired in 1988, but infact only 60 were.   ``The current fleets are very reliable,'' Howard said. ``Airlinesand air traveler confidence in the safety of these airplanes has notbeen lost.''   Still, Howard's report indicates that replacements through 2005will be 20 percent higher in dollar value than last year's estimate.   The report estimates stronger demand for airplanes in the 170-to240-seat category, with the larger aircraft taking over domesticroutes that have outgrown medium-sized airplanes in domesticservice. It also predicts a strong increase in short- tomedium-range jets of more than 350 seats and a modest increase indemand for large, long-range aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
