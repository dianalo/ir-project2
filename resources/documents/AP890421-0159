The news organizations want a court hearing on their motion foraccess to a stipulation summarizing intelligence showing that topReagan administration officials knew at the time that a November1985 shipment to Iran contained Hawk missiles.   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan read portions of the stipulationin closing arguments Wednesday in U.S. District Court, but thedocument wasn't publicly released.   ``The First Amendment ... the common law privilege of access tojudicial records, the Classified Information Procedures Act and thelocal rules of this court each requires that the public and pressto be provided access to this document,'' said the newsorganizations.   Sullivan's remarks from the stipulation apparently have beendeleted from the transcript of the closing argument and the newsorganizations asked for access to a complete transcript.   ``The extent of contemporaneous knowledge by United Statesgovernment officials of this arms shipment, and of later attemptsto cover up such knowledge, has long been a major focus ofattention in the overall Iran-Contra affair,'' said the filing inU.S. District Court.   In his closing arguments, Sullivan said the stipulation had beenreached with the government about what 168 intercepts _ whichremain classified _ showed and to whom they were distributed byspecial courier.   Those receiving the intercepts were CIA director William Casey,deputy national security adviser John Poindexter, Secretary ofDefense Caspar Weinberger and national security adviser RobertMcFarlane and others.   Sullivan said the intercepts showed that officials knew at thetime that missiles were shipped and even what ocean they were overat a particular time and when they got there.   The intercepts remain classified and the court has refused tomake the stipulation available, saying it is for jurors' eyes only,said the court filing by the news organizations. The jury in theNorth case began deliberations Friday.   North is accused of compiling a false chronology in November1986 which said that no one in the U.S. government knew untilJanuary 1986 that the November 1985 shipment contained Hawkmissiles. North attended a Nov. 20, 1986 meeting with Casey andPoindexter and North testified that neither man indicated knowledgethat Hawk missiles had been aboard the Iran-bound aircraft.   The other news organizations filing the motion are Cable NewsNetwork Inc., Capital Cities-ABC Inc., CBS Inc., Dow Jones andamp; Co.Inc., National Broadcasting Co. Inc., National Public Radio, TheNew York Times Co., the Times Mirror Co., and The Washington Post.</TEXT></DOC>
