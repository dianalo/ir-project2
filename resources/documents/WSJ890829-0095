The move means that about 370 of the 1,150 workers at the Janesville truck facility will be laid off beginning Sept. 1, the company said. Another 50 workers will be assigned to non-production jobs. Workers at the Janesville truck plant returned to work only yesterday after a five-month layoff to re-tool for the new truck model.    GM said the decision to delay adding a second production shift at Janesville &quot;reflects a recent downturn in the total medium-duty truck business.&quot;    The Janesville plant is building a new line of GM medium-duty trucks, to be sold as the GMC TopKick and the Chevrolet Kodiak. After the end of the year, all of GM's conventional medium-duty trucks will be built at the Janesville facility, the company said.    GM said production of its old line of conventional medium-duty trucks at the Pontiac Central facility in Pontiac, Mich., will be cut to one shift from two, beginning Sept. 16. That action will result in the layoff of about 800 of the 2,900 workers currently employed at the facility, a company spokesman said.    The Pontiac work force will be cut even further at the end of this year, when the facility shifts to building specialty vehicles such as school buses. The plant is scheduled to close completely by the end of 1990, the spokesman said.    However, the spokesman suggested GM is looking for a way to save jobs at the Pontiac facility. &quot;There's still a lot of discussion going on as to what happens to the people in Pontiac,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
