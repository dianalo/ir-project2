AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Panama today accused the UnitedStates of ``arrogance'' in two recent confrontations that left anAmerican Marine officer dead and a Panamanian policeman wounded.   The latest incident occurred Monday, when a U.S. Army lieutenantshot and wounded a Panamanian police officer. At the time, U.S.forces were on high alert following a Saturday shooting, withPresident Bush refusing to rule out military action against thegovernment of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The general's Defense Forces on Monday called the shooting ofthe policeman an ``ever more reckless aggression'' by the UnitedStates and accused U.S. officials of twisting the facts of the case.   The American involved was leaving a laundry in western PanamaCity when the policeman motioned to him to stop and approached him,according to the U.S. Southern Command. It said the policemanappeared to reach for a gun.   ``The American responded defensively by pulling a weapon andfired two shots,'' the U.S. statement said. ``The Panamanian wentdown, then got up and left the scene.''   Panama, however, said the American was traveling in a vehiclethat ``never stopped and on the contrary, accelerated.''   One of the two shots hit policeman Cesar Tejada in the leftforearm, a Defense Forces communique said.   The civilian laundry, under contract to clean U.S. militaryuniforms, is near Southern Command headquarters and less than amile from Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.   Tensions already were high over Saturday's fatal shooting ofMarine 1st Lt. Robert Paz, 25, of Dallas, and the reported beatingof a Navy couple who U.S. officials say witnessed the shooting.   The government-owned newspaper Critica today called the twoincidents ``epileptic arrogance'' by the United States and lashedout at the ``cynicism to blame the Defense Forces for the criminalactions of Saturday when four U.S. soldiers fired on civilians anddefenseless women.''   U.S. forces stayed on maximum alert but took no public actionother than to patrol their bases in battle gear. Traffic andbusiness in Panama City was normal today.   Since Noriega was indicted on cocaine trafficking charges inFlorida in February 1988 the United States has tried througheconomic, diplomatic and political pressure to drive him from power.   The Panamanian leader claims the U.S. drug charges, which hedenies, are part of a plot by Washington to renege on the 1977Panama Canal treaties, which cede control of the waterway at theend of the century.   Panama says Paz _ and three others with him Saturday _ ran acheckpoint and wounded a Panamanian soldier and two civilians. TheSouthern Command said they were fleeing a crowd of Panamaniansoldiers and people in civilian clothes when the Panamanians openedfire.   Photographs viewed by The Associated Press of the 1981 Chevroletwith Michigan plates in which the Americans were riding showedbullet holes, including two on the driver's side and one throughthe trunk.   U.S. officers said the shots came from Soviet-made AK-47 rifles.   ``This is the most serious incident we have had,'' a U.S.Command spokesman said. ``This involved a loss of life. No courseof action is being ruled out as a response.''   ``We are trying to be rational in our response. We are going totake a calculated plan of action. The U.S. government does notrespond without thinking results through.''   He spoke on the condition of anonymity.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Noriegagovernment's recent declaration of a ``state of war'' with theUnited States ``may have been a license for harassment and threatsand in this case murder.''   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon Garcia, the Panamanian navy chief,said the two military forces were communicating by messenger aboutthe incidents. A U.S. military source said there had been no``negotiations.''   He said Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of the U.S. ArmySouth, had demanded an explanation of the American officer's deathand threatened to invade Panama.   A Southern Command spokesman declined to comment on Castrejon'sversion.   Panama's Defense Forces sent U.S. military officials a letterthat did not explain the shooting but demanded that U.S. forces``exercise maximum prudence to avoid unfortunate incidents.''   Castrejon also denied that the U.S. Navy couple was mistreated,but confirmed they were arrested.   ``At no time any of our defense forces threaten, intimidate ormuch less torture any citizen, much less if he is a foreigner or anAmerican,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
