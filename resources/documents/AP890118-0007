Following Tuesday's announcement by the Defense Ministry, theFree Democrats, a minority party in Chancellor Helmut Kohl'scoalition government, also expressed reservations and asked that themove be delayed.   Given that about 400,000 more draft-age men than needed are nowavailable, the opposition says extending service time is unnecessary.   The Social Democrats also point to a lessened threat from theEast bloc. The armed forces now have about 495,000 members. Men aged18 through 28 are subject to be drafted and about half of those inservice are draftees.</TEXT></DOC>
