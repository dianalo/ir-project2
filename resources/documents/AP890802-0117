(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury today ruled that Home ShoppingNetwork libeled GTE Corp. in blaming the telephone equipmentcompany for lost sales, and it awarded GTE $100 million.   HSN had charged that GTE didn't give it adequate equipment tohandle a large volume of calls in 1986 and 1987 as the TV networkexpanded into 11 new markets. But the six-member Circuit Court jurydisagreed.   The jury awarded $50 million each to GTE Florida and GTECommunications after five hours of deliberations. The jury said $20million should by paid by HSN and $40 million apiece by itschairman and its president.   HSN, which offers items for sale to TV viewers, had sued in1987, claiming it lost millions of telephone calls and about $500million in potential sales because its GTE equipment wasinsufficient for the volume of calls.   GETE, based in Stamford, Conn., countered with a slander andlibel suit blaming HSN's troubles on its own mismanagement.   GTE lawyer Roy Reardon said HSN had failed to mention its plansto buy 11 UHF stations in 1986, which, combined with its entry intothe cable TV market, caused subscribers to soar from 9 million to46.5 million in one year.   Competition from similar retailers also hurt HSN, Reardon said.</TEXT></DOC>
