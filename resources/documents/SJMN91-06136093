But unlike the governor'splan, it calls for an increase from 9.3 percent to 10.8 percent in the topincome tax rate, on those making $100,000 or more.;    The proposal, craftedby Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose, would generate $475 million bytrimming the amount companies can claim for business lunches. It does notfollow Wilson's plan to suspend Proposition 98's schools funding formula orthe governor's bid to eliminate the homeless assistance program.;    &quot;Franklythe (Democratic) tax proposals are not serious,&quot; Wilson told reporters afterhis late-morning budget summit with lawmakers. &quot;Instead of half (spendingcuts) and half (taxes), they have now gone to 2 to 1 -- $8 billion in taxincreases, including tax increases that they know they can't get througheither house.&quot;;    Vasconcellos, the Assembly Ways and Means Committeechairman, said he is disappointed Wilson is rejecting a plan he called arational middle ground.;    &quot;I can't figure out why the rich shouldn't give,&quot;said Vasconcellos. &quot;I don't know who it is that he's protecting or why. That'sthe one question that baffles me.&quot;;    While both Wilson and top Democratsdescribed the meeting in the governor's office as cordial, it is clear theveneer of cooperation on how best to close the worst budget crisis ever facedby a state is nearing its end.;    &quot;The whole package has to look fair to allincome groups in the state,&quot; said Roberti, who has persistently pushed forhigher income taxes on the rich.;    Wilson said a statewide televisionaddress to sell his version of the budget is a &quot;distinct probability&quot; if moreprogress isn't made quickly.;    The governor said he will withdraw supportfor the $6.7 billion worth of taxes he's already proposed unless lawmakersback accompanying plans to wipe out automatic cost of living increases, and totrim the state's welfare grants to the lowest level allowed under federallaw.;    &quot;No spending reforms, no tax increases,&quot; he said.;    Emerging fromtheir conference with Wilson, lawmakers set aside comparisons to this year'sbudget battle and last year's debacle that dragged on into the summer andjeopardized state workers' paychecks.;    &quot;We were circling the wagons (lastyear),&quot; said Roberti. &quot;Now we're all meeting in the same wagon. It's a bigdifference.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  THOMAS FARRAGHER, Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910515  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  612  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 15, 199100136093,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
