PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The movement to reform the Soviet legal system hasnot led to necessary changes in laws regarding Jewish emigration,attorneys from the International Bar Association said on Wednesday.   One attorney, Joseph Smukler of Philadelphia, said Soviet ideason Jewish emigration amount to ``empty words and empty promises.''He made the comment Wednesday at a news conference with Jewishrefuseniks at a Moscow apartment.   Smukler was one of 250 lawyers _ including Soviet delegates _who attended a two-day meeting held Monday and Tuesday in Moscow.   Soviet lawyers appear to be sincere about reforming the legalsystem, yet the emigration problem is not being solved, said IrwinCotler, a lawyer from Montreal. ``There is a legal revolution goingon,'' Cotler said, ``but the problem is that the revolution doesnot embrace the right of emigration.''   He proposed sustained emigration of at least 25,000 Jews a year,a policy of allowing complete reunification of families, andprotection of religious and cultural rights.   New Soviet emigration laws require an invitation from a closerelative, something that international law lists only as a possibleadditional reason to allow emigration, he said.   Emigration of Soviet Jews reached a peak of more than 51,000 in1979. It dropped to about 1,000 a year in 1984-86 before rising tomore than 8,000 last year. About 4,500 Jews were allowed toemigrate between January and May 1988.   Two of the main reasons for Soviet refusal to allow emigrationare alleged access to state secrets and refusal of relatives torenounce financial claims against those who wish to emigrate.   The international lawyers said one Soviet speaker, a lawyer fromthe Institute of State and Law they could identify only asKatishkin, said his institute was studying reforms that could easethose restrictions.   But the lawyers reported that Soviet officials also said theydid not want to allow Soviet citizens to emigrate to countries withfewer social services, or to allow mentally ill people or drugaddicts to emigrate.   Michael Freeman, a law professor at London University, said theSoviet delegates to the conference ``may as well have been robotsor automatons for all their capacity for independent thought.''   The lawyers said the Soviet speaker proposed that restrictionson emigration for reasons of access to state secrets be limited tofive years, and that financial claims against would-be emigres berestricted.   The Soviet news agency Tass reported Tuesday that RudolfKuznetsov, head of the Soviet visa office, told the conference thatSoviet emigration laws are based on international law and that thenumber of people being allowed to emigrate has been increasing.   He said 40,000 people emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1987and 29,000 people left during the first five months of 1988. Thosewho left this year are mostly Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans,he said.   The lawyers said about 20 Israeli lawyers attended theconference but that another 10 were refused visas.   A British lawyer, Jonathan Arkush, said eight other lawyers atfirst were denied visas and the International Bar Associationcanceled the conference until Soviet officials reversed theirdecision.   He said British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe intervenedto gain visas for him and several other British lawyers.</TEXT></DOC>
