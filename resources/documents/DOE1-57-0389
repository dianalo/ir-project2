The solid solutions LaCo/sub1-x/Cr/sub x/O{sub 3} with x {le} 0.7 have rhombohedral structure, andthose with x {ge} 0.8, orthorhombic. The presence of cobalt improvesthe sinterability of the original lanthanum chromite. The dependenceof the room-temperature resistivity on the chromium content passes througha maximum at x = 0.8. All the solid solutions are p-type semiconductors.The coefficients of linear thermal expansion decrease when x andgt; 0.7</TEXT></DOC>
