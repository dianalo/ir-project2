Fatigue cracking isattributed to delamination of the doubler, which results in knife-edgedholes. Failure to detect and repair cracks could lead to rapid decompressionof the airplane.The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 737-53-1078,Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986, which describes procedures for ultrasonicinspection for delamination and cracking of the fuselage window belt skinpanel, and repair procedures.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design, this AD requires ultrasonic inspection for crackingand delamination of the fuselage window belt skin panel, and repair, ifnecessary, in accordance with the service bulletin previously described.Since it is not known how widespread this condition is, reporting requirementsare included in this amendment. Based on the reports received, the FAAwill determine if additional inspections are required.Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days.Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assignedOMB Control Number 2120-0056.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately tocorrect an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If it is determinedthat this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation willbe prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluationis not required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the RulesDocket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:1. The authority citation for Part 39 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g)(Revised Pub.

Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:<ITAG tagnum="26"><T4>Boeing:</T4> Applies to Model 737 series airplanes, line numbers 001through 610, certificated in any category. Compliance required as indicated,unless previously accomplished.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To prevent rapid decompression of the airplane, accomplish the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Except as provided in paragraph B., below, within the next 60 daysafter the effective date of this AD, accomplish an ultrasonic inspectionfor delamination of the window belt skin doubler from the fuselage skin,in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737-53-1078, Revision 1, datedSeptember 25, 1986. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. For aircraft on which the delamination inspection has been accomplishedin accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737-53-1078, initial release,dated August 19, 1983, or Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986, withinthe last 6 years prior to the effective date of this AD, the inspectionsrequired by paragraph A., above, are not required. Report findings of thoseprevious inspections in accordance with paragraph D., below. If delaminationwas detected in the previous inspection and not repaired, within 3,000cycles after the inspection or within 60 days after the effective dateof this AD, whichever occurs later, reinspect for delamination in the affectedskin panel in accordance with paragraph A., above. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. If delamination is found as a result of the inspections requiredby paragraph A. or B., above, prior to further flight, conduct a high frequencyeddy current (HFEC) inspection for cracks of the skin around the countersunkfasteners in the area of delamination, in accordance with Boeing Model737 NDT Manual Document D6-37239, Part 6, Subject 53-30-05. If cracks aredetected, prior to further flight, repair cracking and delamination inaccordance with an FAA-approved method. If no cracks are detected, priorto the accumulation of 3,000 additional landings, reinspect for delaminationin the affected skin panel in accordance with paragraph A., above, andrepeat the HFEC inspection for cracks. Prior to further flight, repairall delamination and any cracks detected at that time in accordance withan FAA-approved method. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. Within 10 days after completion of any inspection required by thisAD, submit a report of findings, positive or negative, to the Manager,Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region.The report must include the line number of the airplane inspected, thenumber of cycles, and the inspection method used, in addition to the findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E.
