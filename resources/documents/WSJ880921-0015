The surprise $58.50-a-share bid, probably the most forceful single action in KKR's history, comes a day after the Haft family of Landover, Md., proposed a $4.36 billion, or $55-a-share, takeover of the Cincinnati-based supermarket chain. Analysts and arbitragers said the credibility and sheer size of KKR's bid would tend to push the financially weaker Hafts out of the picture, and could lead to negotiations between Kroger and KKR.    KKR's unsolicited proposal for Kroger is the closest KKR has ever come to making an outright hostile offer for a company; it is likely to send shivers through the corporate world that once viewed the leveraged buy-out industry as a refuge from hostile raiders.    The giant of the burgeoning LBO industry, KKR has an estimated $5 billion or more in equity available for buy-outs, and can borrow many times that amount from banks and other lenders. KKR's tactics are closely followed by other funds. By thrusting its bid unsolicited upon Kroger, KKR's proposal could become a milestone for the big firm and for other leveraged-buy-out specialists, helping to accelerate the industry's move toward more aggressive -- and even outright hostile -- transactions and away from its roots in strictly friendly buy-outs.    In a letter to Kroger executives from KKR principal George R. Roberts, the big New York-based fund offered to acquire Kroger for $50 a share in cash, $6.50 a share principal amount of subordinated debentures and a continuing equity interest, or &quot;stub,&quot; intended to have a trading value of $2 a share.    Mr. Roberts said the KKR proposal is subject to financing agreements, which are not considered a roadblock, and approval by a majority of Kroger's directors. But while seeking board approval underscores KKR's desire for a friendly transaction, Mr. Roberts added a statement that carried somewhat ominous undertones. &quot;We will do everything in our power,&quot; he wrote, &quot;to effect the acquisition (of Kroger) at the earliest possible date.&quot;    Reacting to the KKR letter, a Kroger spokesman again reaffirmed the company's desire to proceed with its own, previously announced restructuring, which analysts have valued at $53 to $58 a share. The company apparently told KKR the same thing privately; in his letter, Mr. Roberts noted that Kroger executives had spurned earlier requests to discuss a buyout of the company.    It's understood that the previous KKR overture was a recent phone call from a KKR representative to a Kroger adviser, in which the KKR representative pushed for a meeting to discuss a buy-out. Told that Kroger wasn't interested, the KKR representative insisted on &quot;keeping his options open,&quot; according to a person familiar with the conversation.    The KKR proposal boosted Kroger shares $3.625, to $56.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The Hafts declined to comment on the KKR bid.    The interest in Kroger, which has been a rumored takeover target for more than a year, reflects the view that the company's stock is significantly undervalued. Potential acquirers believe they could boost profits and earnings by lowering labor costs, selling low-performing operations and by simply running the company more efficiently.    Kroger, one of the nation's largest supermarket retailers, has an image of being old-fashioned in its marketing approach, especially when compared with other supermarket retailers. For example, some analysts say the company still relies heavily on private brands at a time when grocery shoppers favor name brands.    &quot;Kroger's margins and sales per square foot are less than industry average,&quot; says Gary Giblin, an analyst at Rotan Mosle Inc. in Houston.    KKR's Kroger proposal climaxes a trend toward more aggressive tactics by LBO funds, which are looking for outlets for billions of dollars they have raised from pension funds and other big investors. Earlier this year, for example, KKR silently accumulated a 5% stock position in embattled Texaco Inc. (which KKR later sold). Odyssey Partners, a New York investment firm, joined with a competing bidder to split up pieces of textile giant J.P. Stevens andamp; Co., after Odyssey first agreed to a friendly buy-out of Stevens.    KKR apparently laid the groundwork for its move on Kroger months ago, during discussions with its institutional backers prior to its Texaco investment. Big institutional investors prefer friendly transactions, but people who have worked with KKR say the fund convinced its backers of the necessity of more aggressive maneuvering.    Unsolicited LBO offers are rare, though not unprecedented. They tend to be made according to an unwritten gentleman's agreement in the merger world: If a company puts itself &quot;in play,&quot; as Kroger is perceived to have done with its anti-takeover restructuring, an expression of interest from an LBO firm is acceptable. Usually that overture takes the form of a vague, friendly letter offering a buy-out fund's services, rather than a formal takeover proposal. And such bids are almost never pressed without the willingness of the target company.    If Kroger rejects the KKR proposal, that would put KKR, and to an extent the entire leveraged buy-out industry, at a critical juncture in its evolution. KKR would have to decide whether to proceed with the natural alternative, a hostile tender offer; that would be an unprecedented move for a buy-out firm. Such an offer by the buy-out industry's largest player could ultimately alter the traditionally friendly nature of LBOs.    One investment banker close to KKR said the firm appears to be prepared to launch a hostile tender offer if rebuffed by Kroger. &quot;You don't make a move like this unless you're prepared to go hostile,&quot; the banker said.    However, many analysts don't believe it will come to that. KKR's $58.50-a-share proposal is rich enough that it is unlikely to be topped by the Hafts or any other suitor, they suggest, especially with KKR's reputation for paying top prices for its targets. Based on cash-flow analysis, &quot;this offer is already some 15% to 20% higher than previous (supermarket industry) transactions,&quot; said John B. Kosecoff, an analyst with First Manhattan Co.    Kroger may attempt to sweeten its restructuring, or it could attempt to block KKR by raising the specter of antitrust problems in a KKR takeover. KKR already owns two other major supermarket chains, Safeway Stores and Stop andamp; Shop Cos., but few analysts see any serious antitrust problems developing in the fragmented supermarket industry.    Several investment bankers and analysts said yesterday they believe the big supermarket chain is destined to enter talks with KKR. &quot;They really have no alternative,&quot; said Robert Raiff, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence Inc. &quot;They're kind of mandated toward going to some sort of going-private transaction.&quot;    Added a major arbitrager: &quot;The fact is, Kroger can't tell KKR to kiss off the way they told the Hafts to kiss off. And there probably isn't any white knight that wants to take on KKR at these levels. It's got to be KKR or no one.&quot;    The Kroger situation is reminiscent of the 1986 bid for another big supermarket chain, Safeway Stores, that briefly came under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of its investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. KKR approached Safeway to discuss a buy-out before the Hafts made their interest known publicly, but KKR was rejected. When the Hafts launched a surprise bid for the company, KKR used the threatening presence of the Hafts to press a reluctant Safeway into a buy-out.    ---   Constance Mitchell in Pittsburgh contributed to this article.    ---                   KKR's Biggest Deals                                                 PRICE    ACQUISITION                   DATE        (in billions)    Beatrice Cos.
