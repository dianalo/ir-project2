A cerificate holder is required by law (section 308 of the Act, 5 U.S.C.4018) to submit to the Department of Commerce annual reports that updatefinancial and other information relating to business activities coveredby its certificate. The annual report is due within 45 days after the anniversarydate of the issuance of the certificate of review (andSection;andSection;325.14(a) and (b) of the Regulations). Failure to submit a complete annual reportmay be the basis for revocation (andSection;andSection;325.10(a) and 325.14(c)of the Regulations). On May 19, 1988, the Department of Commerce sent to Watsand a letter containingannual report questions with a reminder that its annual report was dueon July 13, 1988. Additional reminders were sent on August 12 and on August29, 1988. The Department has received no written response to any of theseletters.  On September 13, 1988, and in accordance with andSection;325.10(c)(2) ofthe Regulations, a letter was sent by certified mail to notify Watsandthat the Department was formally initiating the process to revoke its certificate.The letter stated that this action is being taken for the certificate holder'sfailure to file an annual report.  In accordance with andSection;325.10(c)(2) of the Regulations, each certificateholder has thirty days from the day after its receipt of the notificationletter in which to respond. The certificate holder is deemed to have receivedthis letter as of the date on which this notice is published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>For good cause shown, the Deparment of Commercecan, at its discretion, grant a thirty-day extension for a response.  If the certificate holder decides to respond, it must specifically addressthe Department's statement in the notification letter that it has failedto file an annual report. It should state in detail why the facts, conduct,or circumstances described in the notification letter are not true, orif they are, why they do not warrant revoking the certificate. If the certificateholder does not respond within the specified period, it will be consideredan admission of the statements contained in the notification letter (andSection;325.10(c)(2)of the Regulations).   If the answer demonstrates that material facts are in dispute, the Departmentof Commerce and the Department of Justice shall, upon request, meet informallywith the certificate holder. Either Department may require the certificateholder to provide the documents or information that are necessary to supportits contentions (andSection; 325.10(c)(3) of the Regulations).
