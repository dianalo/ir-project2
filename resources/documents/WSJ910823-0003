Mikhail Moiseyev, whoseposition on the coup was ambivalent, to be new defenseminister. Mr. Bush later indicated he didn't have an opinionon the choice, saying that &quot;who's on first over there is upto them.&quot;   Taken together, the comments seemed to represent anattempt by the U.S. to gently nudge Mr. Gorbachev to takeadvantage of the opening represented by the collapse of hishard-line foes and move ahead quickly with reforms of theSoviet system.   Mr. Bush's decision to end the freeze on economic tieswith the Soviet Union had been expected, and its impact willbe limited. The administration had drawn up a long list ofcurrent areas of economic cooperation, all of which were puton hold when Mr. Gorbachev was ousted. But the coup was soshort-lived that the freeze on economic cooperation hadlittle impact on U.S. plans to provide technical aid to theSoviet economy, to ratify a trade treaty with the Soviets andto provide $1.5 billion of credits for purchases of U.S.grain. Those programs now will proceed as planned before thecoup.   The bigger question now facing the administration iswhether to offer any changes in the program of economiccooperation now that hard-line Communist forces in Moscowappear to have been quashed. While Mr. Bush and otherofficials insisted that no new aid is imminent, theypointedly declared that the failure of the coup could speedup the process of radical economic change inside the SovietUnion. If that happens, the administration is signaling thatit is prepared to consider accelerating the process ofproviding Western help.   &quot;I think one of the things you have to remember abouteconomic policy now is that it {the coup's failure} mayremove some of the constraints which Gorbachev felt he had onhim,&quot; a senior administration official told reporters here.The departure of the coup leaders, particularly PrimeMinister Valentin Pavlov, should make it easier for Mr.Gorbachev to move toward a market economy. Mr. Pavlov, theofficial said, was an &quot;architect&quot; of the go-slow approach tomarket changes that Mr. Gorbachev has been taking for months.   Moreover, Mr. Bush signaled that the enhanced stature ofRussian President Boris Yeltsin and other elected leadersfollowing the coup means that the U.S. needn't rely only onMr. Gorbachev. Asked if he now expects economic reform toproceed more swiftly, Mr. Bush replied, &quot;I haven't had anopportunity to discuss that with {Mr. Gorbachev}. I haven'thad an opportunity yet to discuss it with any of thepresidents of the republics. But I would like to think allelements in Moscow and all the parliaments would recognizethat the best way to get economic support from the West wouldbe to adopt a genuine and far-reaching economic reformprogram.&quot;   Mr. Bush's call for accelerating the independence of theBaltic republics were his most pointed comments yet on theissue. He said that &quot;genuine negotiations&quot; toward that end&quot;would do more to enhance good will in the United States thanalmost any single thing that could be done.&quot;   Those comments also seemed to be a nod toward Mr.Yeltsin's enhanced power. The Russian president has advocatedsimply giving the Baltics their freedom, while Mr. Gorbachevhas advocated a more methodical process of allowing them togain more autonomy.   The fate of the Baltics is one of the touchiest issues yetto be resolved in the aftermath of the failed coup. Duringthe crisis, the Baltic republics of Latvia and Estoniadeclared their independence. The republic of Lithuania hadtaken that step previously, but Latvia and Estonia had optedfor a more gradual process of breaking away. Now, Mr. Bushcalled for &quot;genuine negotiations between the Baltic statesand the center to accomplish this end,&quot; adding: &quot;perhapsrecent events will speed the day.&quot;   The confusion and uncertainty following the failed coupwas reflected in the differing signals coming from theadministration about the choice of Gen. Moiseyev as the newdefense minister. A senior official initially questioned thechoice, saying it wasn't clear whether the general hadopposed the coup attempt and declaring that &quot;I wouldn't wantthat guy behind me in a dark hall now.&quot; Officials said thatsentiment was a personal view based on, among other things, awarning Secretary of State James Baker received from oneSoviet source that the general had participated in theconspiracy.   But later, President Bush, who officials said had beenassured by Mr. Gorbachev that Gen. Moiseyev was cooperative,said that the Soviet president &quot;appears to have put sometrust in Moiseyev . . . and he is a man that we've workedwith.&quot; Still, Mr. Bush said that the U.S. will &quot;hold back alittle on military-to-military contacts until we see thissort out.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
