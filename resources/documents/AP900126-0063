WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MINDELO, Cape Verde (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II today urged CapeVerde's Catholics to guard their Christian faith as the islandnation struggles to overcome poverty.   Speaking to 35,000 chanting islanders in Mindelo, the formerPortuguese colony's cultural and economic capital on Sao Vicenteisland, John Paul praised the islanders for their faith in the faceof ``adverse conditions.''   Cape Verde's 10 islands are part of West Africa's impoverishedSahel region, which for years had been plagued by drought, famineand encroaching deserts.   ``Without natural riches, your country is searching ... withsome success, for the paths to steady progress,'' the pope told thetown's packed sports stadium.   He said shortages of rainfall and food as well as storms in thearchipelago off the West African coast were a ``trial ofsuffering'' that had strengthened the islanders' faith.   To the delight of the crowd, a light drizzle marked the pope'sarrival on Sao Vicente.   ``Never hesitate to sacrifice everything to stay faithful toChrist,'' the pope implored the crowd in Portuguese.   The archipelago, colonized by the Portuguese in the 15thcentury, has Africa's highest concentration of Roman Catholics,over 90 percent of its 360,000 inhabitants.   While stressing that the church supported progress thatguaranteed human integrity and harmony, the pope urged: ``Don't letyourselves be chained by the myth of economic progress.''   ``Fight against religious indifference _ the dangeroustemptation of modern times...to abandon religious practices whenyou become too concerned with material interests, success, orprofessional and social advancement,'' he said.   The Polish-born pontiff received a clamorous welcome on Salisland and in the capital, Cidade da Praia, on Thursday after heurged rich countries not to abandon the needy Third World in favorof Eastern European countries emerging from years of Communist rule.   During John Paul's eight-day tour of the region, the sixthAfrican voyage of his pontificate, he will also visitGuinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.   Though Cape Verde is one of the more prosperous nations in theregion, many islanders have left in search of better livingconditions.   An estimated 400,000 Cape Verdians live and work abroad, mainlyin the United States, Portugal, France and the Netherlands.   The pope also mentioned emigrants' problems in his Mindeloaddress, advising them not to lose their cultural identity andChristian faith.</TEXT></DOC>
