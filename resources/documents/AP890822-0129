Hastingsimpeachment trial.   U.S. District Judge Thomas Pennfield Jackson found Borders incontempt of court and gave him until 10 a.m. Friday to put hisaffairs in order and surrender to federal marshals.   Jackson acted hours after Borders refused for the third time in amonth to answer questions posed by the Hastings impeachmentcommittee.   The committee is gathering evidence concerning charges thatHastings, a 52-year-old U.S. district judge from Florida, conspiredwith Borders to obtain a $150,000 payoff and lied about it before ajury that acquitted him in 1983.   Hastings, who was impeached by the House in August 1988, is alsoaccused of improperly disclosing information that governmentinvestigators obtained through a court-approved wiretap.   Once the committee finishes its report, the full Senate will voteon whether to remove Hastings from the federal bench and thus takeaway the $89,500 annual salary he continues to collect.   While Hastings was acquitted by a federal court jury, Borders wasconvicted of the payoff conspiracy charges in 1982. He wasdisbarred, sent to prison for 33 months and shorn of the politicalinfluence officials say he wielded in the Washington of the late1970s.   At the request of the Senate, Jackson held Borders in civilcontempt of court for refusing to testify after being grantedimmunity from prosecution for anything concerning the payoff plotthat he might say in the proceeding.   ``This court ... confines him to the custody of the U.S. marshaluntil he purges himself,'' Jackson said.   Jackson said Borders could win his release whenever he wished,simply by answering questions from the committee. If he remainssilent, however, he will remain behind bars until the Senate voteson whether to remove Hastings from the bench, most likely beforemid-October.   Borders on Tuesday refused to answer 10 questions posed by Sen.Arlen Specter, R-Pa. They ranged from whether Hastings received anypayoff money to the reported relationship between Borders and thelate Florida Mafia boss Santo Trafficante.   In reply to each of the questions, Borders cited a statement heread to the panel July 27, when he had remained similarly silent. Init, he refused to answer questions on grounds that they violated hisconstitutional rights, including his 5th Amendment right againstself-incrimination.   Borders was arrested in October 1981 when he drove out of asuburban Virginia motel with a garment bag containing $125,000 incash and accompanied by a retired FBI agent masquerading as aconvicted racketeer in quest of leniency from Hastings.</TEXT></DOC>
