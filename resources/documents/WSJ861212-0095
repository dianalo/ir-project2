Throughout town, unfinished bare-cement and brick houses, abandoned during construction, have gaping holes where windows should be. Roads are littered. Groups of idle, unshaven men loiter in the square near Patrizia Carvelli's cafe.    &quot;There's nothing here,&quot; says Ms. Carvelli as she steams the milk for a capuccino. &quot;All the kids who can, go away when they finish school. If they stay here, there's nothing to do. I have work. I'm one of the lucky ones.&quot;    Once, men from the village found work abroad and sent money back to their families to build homes. Then the oil shocks of the 1970s dried up the jobs and the flow of cash. The half-finished houses remain as empty monuments to the prosperity that might have been.    Petilia is an example of some of the most intractable problems of the Mezzogiorno, Italy's depressed South. After 40 years of state projects and billions of dollars in government funds, few lasting jobs have been created. Living standards have improved, but residents have become dependent on state handouts. The gap between North and South, always great, is getting worse.    &quot;The South will be the true great dramatic problem of Italy in the next 10 years,&quot; says Labor Minister Gianni De Michelis.&quot;    Per-capita income has stagnated at 62% of the level in the North for more than 12 years, and the South's 17.7% unemployment rate is more than double the North's. And while the North's population is declining, the South's baby boom continues. By the year 2000 the work force here will swell by 1.5 million people; the jobless rate could top 20% by 1990.    The region's schools graduate as many men and women as do those in the northern industrial and financial center of Milan, notes Mr. De Michelis. &quot;But it's a developing country in terms of economics. The job market can't absorb all these people.&quot;    The likely result, experts say, will be an exodus northward of a scope not seen in Italy for more than two decades. Such a population shift, some fear, could be a social time bomb for Italy. With companies in the North increasingly automated, the kinds of industrial jobs migrants once filled there are no longer plentiful.    Mass migration could also bleed the Mezzogiorno dry. &quot;Those who emigrate are usually the ones with the most entrepreneurial spirit,&quot; says Sergio De Julio, a computer-science professor at the University of Cosenza. &quot;The region will lose a whole generation of innovators.&quot;    Economists, government officials and residents of the South themselves often blame the lack of an innovative, risk-taking spirit as the root of their problems. Some point to reliance on public works, the outflow of the most enterprising and skilled southerners and the absence of local industrial centers to spur growth. Analysts also fault the government for providing aid instead of jobs and for squandering funds on often useless projects.    Politicians have been discussing the Mezzogiorno's problem since the area was conquered by Garibaldi in 1860. But it wasn't until after World War II that major infusions of government funds began.    Life improved, even in Calabria, a region so poor and underdeveloped that some call it &quot;the Mezzogiorno of the Mezzogiorno.&quot; Starvation and malaria are gone; illiteracy is rare; a new university serves the population; an autostrada now links Rome and Naples with Calabria's biggest cities.    But the gains were costly: A quarter of Calabria's population lives on government pensions, instead of salaries; the autostrada brought in mass-produced consumer products from the North, driving many small local manufacturers out of business.    &quot;We've created consumers, not producers,&quot; says Dominico Cersosimo, an offical at the state's Institute for Assistance in the Development of the Mezzogiorno in Cosenza. Today, the Mezzogiorno, which begins just a few miles south of Rome, accounts for 40% of Italy's territory and 35% of its population but just 10% of exports. Business development in many regions is stifled by local mafias, which breed on fat government contracts. As big companies in the North post record profits and overall Italian wealth grows, the South falls further behind.    In the 1950s and 1960s, the government tried industrialization. It built big steel, auto and chemical plants in the South, many of which are now in deep trouble, often because political pressures made closure of inefficient plants impossible.    Some analysts now propose focusing on the traditional southern industry, agriculture. But 24% of Calabria's population already works in cultivating olives, chestnuts and other produce on the 10% of the land that isn't untillable mountains.    Another hope, included in the new nine-year, $86 billion law for the Mezzogiorno passed by Parliament last summer, is to stimulate creation of firms through investment incentives and aid, an approach that already has succeeded in some parts of the Mezzogiorno.    A few miles outside Cosenza stands a factory that is a model of what the government is trying to achieve. Antonio Tenuta's Giat S.p.A. slices and quick-freezes local tomatoes and zucchini for sale to restaurant suppliers and frozen-food makers. Giat exports 75% of its $21.5 million in sales, has a licensee for its patented process in Japan and is looking for a partner in the U.S.    Despite the state funds, Mr. Tenuta says, operating here is a handicap. Simple things like phone service, electricity and export certificates, he says, take months instead of days to obtain. &quot;The Italian state pays civil servants to help its citizens,&quot; says Mr. Tenuta. &quot;But too often, unfortunately, they are an obstruction.&quot; Mr. Tenuta recently set up his own in-house marketing department because he couldn't find a local firm with the international expertise he needs.    &quot;Without the state help, I would have had fewer possibilities,&quot; he says. But he would have started his business anyway. &quot;The state can't create an entrepreneur.&quot;    Meanwhile, the government has drawn up half a dozen laws to create jobs for those under 30, who are hardest hit by unemployment. In 1985, 43% of those aged 20-24 were jobless in the South, vs. 23% in the North; for ages 25-29, the rate was 21% in the South and 9% in the North.    Some of the new laws will let southern industrial firms hire younger workers for lower pay, or for short, fixed-term contracts. There are plans for youth job training, and to form a new civil service, providing low-paying temporary work.    Many economists see another hope for the South: tourism. Calabria has hundreds of miles of beautiful beaches, mountains suited to skiing and some of Italy's prized ancient Greek archaeological heritage. </TEXT></DOC>
