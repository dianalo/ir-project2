Manfred Gerlach, the leader of the non-Communist LiberalDemocrat Party, announced on national television that he was namedthe new interim head of state and that he will serve untilParliament elects a permanant president.   His announcement came shortly after the official media said EgonKrenz, the former Communist Party chief, had resigned as head ofstate.   The state-run news agency ADN announced it had indications thatpeople were storming army installations, and it appealed for thepro-democracy movement to remain calm during the political crisis.   ``In the last few hours, there have been growing indications ofstormings of facilities and installations of the National People'sArmy,'' the government said in a statement distributed by ADN.   It did not specify where the assaults were taking place, or sayhow many people were involved. The government called for ``calm andrestraint.''   On Tuesday, angry citizens began surrounding and in some casesforcing their way into buildings housing the secret police in aneffort to stop the destruction of documents needed in prosecutionsof former Communist officials.   The Liberal Democrats were long allied with the Communist Partybut have since said that they will no longer run in a Communist-ledbloc.   Gerlach has been spearheading drives for reforms in East Germanyand has been taking on an increasingly prominent role since theouster of hard-line Communist Party leader Erich Honecker on Oct.18.   The political makeup of East Germany, which was founded in 1949,is being shaped by the pro-democracy movement on a day-by-day basis.   The country is now run by a 25-member committee of Communistswho took over when the Communist leadership resigned Sunday. Aspecial party congress will decide on a new party leadership Friday.   A non-Communist has never before held the post of president inEast Germany. Under previous Communist governments, the post hadbeen largely ceremonial, but it was unclear whether it would have amore important role in the current turmoil shaking the country.Reflecting the political crisis in the country, Gerlach said he was``not happy'' about taking on the new duties.   Also today, the Defense Council, which commands the armedforces, resigned. Krenz, who had led the council, came to power onOct. 18, but he was unpopular because of his ties to the previousleadership. He has now lost all his posts.   He resigned as Communist party chief on Sunday, along with theruling Politburo and the entire policy-making Central Commitee.   The embattled Communists, who had planned to hold the emergencycongress on Dec. 15, will now hold it Friday and totally revamp theparty structure.   Reform began in East Germany after Honecker was forced outfollowing 18 years in power. Since then, a popular uprising andexodus of thousands of people to the West have forced the Communistgovernment to open East Germany's borders and the Berlin Wall toallow citizens to travel freely.   The Communist Party also has given up its guaranteed monopoly onpower.   The swift and wholly unexpected changes have left what manypeople in this country regard as a dangerous power vaccuum in EastGermany.   The official ADN news agency said the emergency Communist Partycongress on Friday will propose a ``radical'' reformation of theparty into a ``modern socialist party committed to democraticsocialism.''   There already has been widespread talk of renaming the CommunistParty, while the leadership itself has warned it faces a possiblebreakup.   ``The congress must make a final break with the Stalinistsystem'' and put the party on an even footing with other politicalforces, ADN said. It said the Communists want to elect a leadershipthat will be able to ``guarantee its full authority as a party withequal rights in the reform of society.''   No reason was given today for Krenz's resignation as president.The announcement came three days after he quit as Communist Partychief because his ties to former party leaders made himunacceptable to the reform movement.   Krenz has been virtually without power since stepping down asCommunist Party general secretary on Sunday.   His ties with past leaders had made him the target of growingcriticism, within the party and among opposition groups. He waspresident since Oct. 24. </TEXT></DOC>
