The bulk etch rate Vsub(G),the track etch rate Vsub(T) and the sensitivity of the track detectorVsub(T)/Vsub(G) were measured for different etchant temperatures andion energies. The maximum etched track lengths of the /sup 238/U ionswere experimentally measured, and surface etching and overetching correctionswere applied to the observed track lengths in order to obtain the truetrack lengths. The results were compared with the theoretical energyrange calculations.</TEXT></DOC>
