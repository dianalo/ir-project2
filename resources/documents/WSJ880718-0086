Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Paul Kirk planned this Democratic National Convention, and the last thing he wants to emerge from it is news.    The 50-year-old Mr. Kirk, a spare, laconic, friendly man, is chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and he has quietly, sometimes courageously, tried to put the world's oldest political party back together.    He has curtailed the role of special-interest groups, pulled together a smooth political operation and put the party in its best financial shape in decades.    This week, more than anything else, he seeks a sprightly, well-organized convention in which almost nothing unpredictable happens. Real news from Atlanta, he figures, is bad news.    Mr. Kirk's greatest wish, then, is that an unpredictable Jesse Jackson and a stubborn Michael Dukakis reach an accommodation that will allow the convention, starting today, to get about its carefully scripted business without interruption.    But after four years of struggle to bring unity and comity to a fractious party, Chairman Kirk may be disappointed. The Rev. Jackson and many of his delegates and supporters are unhappy, and some of their ire is directed at Mr. Kirk. If this anger isn't contained, it will spill over to the convention floor, in prime television time.    Willie Brown, speaker of the California Assembly and chairman of Mr. Jackson's campaign, has called Mr. Kirk &quot;a jerk&quot; and he says he hasn't any reason to change that opinion. &quot;From our standpoint,&quot; he says, &quot;he has not been a successful chairman. Here in Atlanta, he is stifling debate, and he has even put us in non-union hotels. It is appalling.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis has said he would retain Mr. Kirk as party chairman through the general election. But if an early accommodation isn't reached, it is conceivable Mr. Kirk might end up on the sacrificial altar -- replaced for the fall campaign as a sop by the Dukakis forces to the Jackson people.    That would be ironic, for Mr. Kirk was elected as the candidate of party liberals and over the intense opposition of conservative white Southerners. He was a Kennedy man -- national political director of Sen. Edward Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign -- and conservatives feared his election would signal a Kennedy takeover of the national political apparatus.    Almost everyone misjudged the new chairman.    &quot;I decided from the start,&quot; says Mr. Kirk, running this convention from his office on the 47th floor of the Marriott Marquis Hotel, &quot;that I wasn't going to be a caretaker chairman.&quot;    Massachusetts-born and Harvard-educated, Mr. Kirk took over as national chairman in 1985. It wasn't the best of times for Democrats. Walter Mondale had just lost 49 of the 50 states in running for president. The national party was deeply in debt and widely perceived as being in hock to all kinds of contentious special interests.    What Mr. Kirk did, straight off, was make almost everyone angry. &quot;It was a punishing first year,&quot; he says.    Mr. Kirk outraged the party's noisiest liberals by canceling a midterm conference scheduled for 1986, closing down all the special-interest caucuses attached to the national committee, telling organized labor it shouldn't give an early endorsement to a presidential candidate, firing dozens of staffers and stripping the vice chairmen of most of their staff and almost all of their travel budgets.    He said the next party platform would be short and sweet, instead of the usual long-winded grab bag of favors for the various interest groups that had come to be seen as part of the national party.    &quot;When Bob Strauss was chairman,&quot; says Mark Siegel, a member of the Democratic National Committee and its executive director a dozen years ago, &quot;he could never have even have contemplated taking steps like these.&quot; He says: &quot;It was a little like Nixon going to China. Only a Massachusetts liberal could have turned the Democratic Party around.&quot;    The falling-out with Mr. Jackson goes back to the dispute over choosing a black vice chairman. The Congressional Black Caucus, with the support of Mr. Jackson, said Mayor Richard Hatcher of Gary, Ind., should remain in office as a vice chairman. Mr. Kirk, a quietly stubborn man, said the choice should go before the full national committee. Mr. Hatcher, who now is the vice chairman of the Jackson campaign, was defeated by Roland Burris, the Illinois state comptroller. That planted the seeds of discontent between Mr. Kirk and the Jackson forces.    But if Mr. Kirk lost liberal friends, he picked up lots more among the more moderate Democrats.    &quot;I have been to confession,&quot; says John Henry Anderson, the Georgia party chairman, who opposed Mr. Kirk's election as national chairman. &quot;I am now Paul Kirk's No. 1 cheerleader. He's the best thing I've seen in Democratic politics in 26 years. He's put it together.&quot;    &quot;He's the most delightful surprise in my whole political life,&quot; says Charles Whitehead, the Florida party chairman. &quot;He's done the things that needed to be done. Florida's a tough state for Democratic presidential candidates, but our state officeholders will be proud to run with this ticket and on this platform.&quot;    Mr. Kirk first of all challenged the way the party had seemingly been taken over by the special interests. Out went those caucuses serving the interests of blacks, Hispanics, women, gays and lesbians, youth and Asian-Pacific Americans.    He then turned to the nuts and bolts. He paid off a $4 million debt left over from the Mondale campaign and reduced the party's other debts by $600,000. The party goes into the 1988 campaign in its strongest financial condition in modern history.    He fired most of the deadwood on the national committee's political staff and brought in new, energetic campaign workers. State parties were given all kinds of technical assistance. Computers came of age under Mr. Kirk. For the first time ever, voter information is available to the party in computers in every state in the country.    &quot;The state parties are in better shape than they've been in a very long time,&quot; says Joe Grandmaison, the New Hampshire party chairman, &quot;and Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are going to be the beneficiaries.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
