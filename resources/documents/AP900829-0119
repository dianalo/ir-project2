The complaint in Manhattan's federal court was filed lastSeptember by a former Helmsley company executive who said Mrs.Helmsley's actions had reduced the size of his commissions.   The suit had contended that Mrs. Helmsley, with the help of aformer personal aide, fraudulently transferred to her possessionthings like a $16 million apartment building, a corporate jet andmore than $90 million of bearer bonds.   The scheme was part of an effort to circumvent a prenuptialagreement between the Helmsleys, the suit claimed. It said thetransfers were accomplished ``by taking advantage of Mr. Helmsley'sdeclining mental facilities.''   U.S. District Judge Kenneth Conboy ruled that the lawsuit had nostanding under the civil racketeering law because the plaintiff,William R. Miller, was an ``indirect secondary victim of thesealleged frauds.''   Miller was president of a Helmsley real estate subsidiary, BrownHarris Stevens, until April.   The suit claimed that Miller lost out on commissions and bonusesfrom Brown Harris Stevens because the alleged scheme deprived thecompany of profits.   Miller also said Mrs. Helmsley had charged him with theft andforced his resignation from the company.   Calls to attorneys for Mrs. Helmsley and Miller were notimmediately returned.   Mrs. Helmsley, 70, who is president of Helmsley Hotels, wasconvicted in August 1989 of federal tax fraud charges and wassentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million. She isfree pending her appeal.   Her 81-year-old husband, Harry, also was charged in the criminalcase but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial.   The civil lawsuit had named Mrs. Helmsley, several top Helmsleyexecutives and Helmsley Enterprises and 11 subsidiaries.</TEXT></DOC>
