The tax has outraged many foreign business people here,who say it represents another in a series ofgovernment-imposed cost increases despite certain favorablechanges in China's tax laws. The issue could also find itsway into the intense bilateral talks that are expected toresult from last year's $10.4 billion U.S. deficit in tradewith China.</LP><TEXT>   The tax is focusing discontent on a state-run employmentsystem for offices of foreign companies. The government'sForeign Enterprise Service Co., known as Fesco, takes 75% to80% of the government-set official salaries that foreigncompanies pay for local employees. As a result, the companiesfind they must pay a second, unofficial salary directly tothe local employees to motivate them.   Fesco is a throwback to the late 1970s, when Chinareopened its doors to foreigners on a large scale. Thegovernment agency is supposed to provide trained employeesfor foreign companies' offices. But at least in the earlydays, Fesco's unspoken mission was to place security agentsin those offices to keep an eye on activities. Some companiesbelieve this is still the case, so they bring in Chineseworkers from Hong Kong to fill sensitive positions.   Fesco is also supposed to provide Chinese nationalsworking for foreign companies with state-subsidized housing,food coupons and other benefits that they would get inChinese state-run enterprises. But in reality, it fallsshort. Some who have been with Fesco for 10 years stillhaven't been given any subsidized housing.   Longtime dissatisfaction with Fesco welled up in Februarywhen Beijing announced that the city would begin enforcing awidely ignored 1986 law requiring Chinese nationals who earnmore than 400 yuan ($77) a month to pay income tax. Under anew city directive, foreign employers are liable forpenalties of as much as 5,000 yuan for each instance offailing to withhold and pay local employees' taxes.   So far, the tax is being imposed only in Beijing. TheChinese capital is home for about 1,500 offices of foreigncompanies, about 80% of the total in China. These offices,which employ about 3,500 Chinese nationals, represent suchentities as foreign banks, law firms, trading companies,consulting firms and multinational corporations. The taxdirective doesn't apply to factories that have foreigninvestors.   City tax authorities set a deadline of tomorrow for theseoffices to file employee tax-withholding statements. Taxauthorities have set May 10 as the final day for payment ofthe taxes, which are retroactive to Jan. 1.   For a high-paid employee, the bite is severe. Foreignconcerns currently pay Fesco about 3,500 yuan a month for atrained office manager, and Fesco then gives theadministrator about 750 yuan a month. In such a case, he orshe would also get about 2,000 yuan a month directly from theforeign employer. This money is designated as clothing, food,transportation and housing allowances but is in reality a&quot;secondary salary.&quot;   Smaller trading offices are expected to increase secondarysalaries to make up for their employees' losses. But the costfor large companies would be high. International BusinessMachines Corp.'s IBM China, for example, has around 150 localemployees in Beijing, and American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo.'s ATandamp;T China unit has 60.   &quot;Employees expect the companies to eat their loss,&quot; saysone director of a foreign office. &quot;If companies can'tcompensate their employees, the employees will find a way tohurt you through inefficiency.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
