Safra.   ``There is a second $4 million,'' the company said in astatement released after the New York Times reported in Tuesday'seditions about the higher total.   The second $4 million _ intended to reimburse expenses Safraincurred _ was not disclosed last week because ``we didn't view itas part of the apology'' to Safra, said American Express spokesmanLarry Armour.   In a letter dated July 24, American Express Chairman James D.Robinson III apologized to Safra for ``an unauthorized and shamefuleffort'' by people acting on American Express' behalf to encouragefalse media reports that Safra's banks had been involved with moneylaundering.   In the letter, he said American Express would donate $4 millionto charities of Safra's choice.   The Times reported that American Express actually had agreed topay $8 million, including the $4 million in donations mentioned inan exchange of letters that the two sides released Friday indisclosing their settlement.   ``We regarded the $4 million mentioned in Friday's exchange ofletters as a clear and simple apology for conduct we regretted,''American Express said in its statement Tuesday on the matter.   Safra, an international banker who lives in Geneva, Switzerland,made a career out of providing banking services to the very rich. Aformer American Express executive, he controls Safra RepublicHoldings SA and holds a large stake in Republic National Bank ofNew York.   American Express said Tuesday that it had ``made no attempt tohide'' the second $4 million, but added, ``we didn't discuss iteither because we didn't regard it as part of the apology.''   American Express said ``the Safra people had wanted us toreimburse them for expenses which they said were in the $4 millionrange.''   ``We felt that was an inappropriate request but rather than dragout what had already become a long and difficult negotiation and inan effort to resolve matters, we were willing to make theadditional $4 million contribution to charity as a further gestureof goodwill,'' the statement read.   Asked if there were any other undisclosed payments or otherfeatures of the settlement with Safra that American Express had notdisclosed on its own, Armour said there were none ``to the best ofmy knowledge.''</TEXT></DOC>
