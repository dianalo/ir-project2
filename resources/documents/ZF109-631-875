(portrait)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Simplifying land management with GISandM;Gulf States Paper is a privately held paper company that presides over morethan 400,000 acres of woodlands, mostly in Alabama.andP;  The company uses itsvast geographic resources for a variety of purposes, including logging,mineral mining, leasing of specific areas to private hunting clubs, andcommercial and residential development.andM;Until 1982, all of Gulf States Paper's land and the various activitiesconducted on it were managed entirely without computer assistance.andP;  Howefficiently--or chaotically--the woodlands were managed depended on theskills and idiosyncrasies of the various managers involved.andM;&quot;The guy who managed timber just did his own thing,&quot; said Ron Frebis, managerof land information services for Gulf States.andP;  &quot;He didn't know anything aboutwhat the recreation section or the development section was doing or planningto do.&quot;andM;&quot;Sometimes development would sell a tract that recreation had plans for,&quot;Frebis said.andP;  &quot;All the sections had their own maps.andP;  Sometimes they didn'teven agree with each other on what land we owned.&quot;andM;Gulf States Paper decided to purchase a geographic information system (GIS)from Intergraph of Huntsville, Ala., for its VAX-11/750.andP;  The company thenproceeded to digitize its store of more than 200 hand-drawn quadrant maps.andM;The VAX-11/750 functions as the GIS's central processor.andP;  Three Integraph LSIgraphics terminals, a diskless Intergraph InterView 68000 workstation and anIntegraph InterPro 120 Clipper RISC workstation are also connected to GulfStates Paper's VAX.andM;EAch workstation and graphics terminal is equipped with its own digitizingtable.andP;  The InterView 68000 includes 2MB of internal RAM; the InterPro 120has 826MB of disk storage.andP;  Gulf States Paper also acquired threeHewlett-Packard pen plotters (E-sized, D-sized and a desktop model) forgenerating hard-copy versions of its maps.andM;In addition, five VT100 terminals and 10 PCs running VT100 terminal emulationsoftware are connected directly to the VAX-11/750.andP;  The VAX, InterPro 120 andthe PC are linked via a fiber-optic backbone that was installed in 1987.andP;  Theremaining PCs, LSI terminals and the InterView 68000 are connected to the VAXvia coaxial cable.andM;For the GIS software, Gulf States Paper first employed Intergraph's GraphicPolygon Processing Utility, and later upgraded to Intergraph's Spatial Editorand Spatial Analyst.andM;Total hardware, software and user training costs for the GIS, not includingthe VAX-11/750, which the paper company already owned, came to $500,00.andP;  GulfStates Paper MIS managers justified purchasing the system by pointing to theanticipated improvement in communication between the company's variousdepartments, and by calling attention to the urgent need to providestandardized maps throughout the company.andM;According to Frebis, the GIS' annual operating expenses amout toapproximately $250,000 and maintenance adds an additional $65,000 per year.andO;In constructing a return on investment (ROI) scenario, Gulf States Paperamortized the GIS equipment over an eight-year period.andM;Because of the massive backlog of hand-drawn maps, customizing the GIS was anextensive process that required 18 man-months of programming labor.andP;  The workincluded linking the maps to the in-house database, creating user interfacesand setting up GIS operating parameters.andM;Although Gulf States Paper initially miscalculated a few GIS hardware needs,the company has managed to smooth over rough spots gracefully.andP;  &quot;Wedefinitely underestimated the amount of RAM [the GIS] needed,&quot; Frebis said.andO;&quot;We started out with 4MB of RAM [on the VAX] ane ended up with 14MB.&quot;andM;In addition, the VAX's disk storage had to be expanded from 600MB to morethan 2GB.andP;  Digitizing the company's hand-drawn quadrant maps alone required75MB of disk space.andM;gulf States Paper's largest GIS implementation cost, aside from hardware andsoftware expenses, was establishing the system's extensive database usingIntergraph's VAX-based Data Management Retrieval System (DMRS), Frebis said.andM;&quot;Most people fail to take into consideration the cost of establishing basedata,&quot; he said.&quot;andP;  Whether you buy [the database] or do it yourself, it'sgenerally equal to 100 percent of the cost of acquiring the system to beginwith.&quot;andM;Underscoring the point, Frebis said that digitizing Gulf State Paper'squadrant maps required three man-years' worth of effort and costapproximately $500,000--the system's original hardware and software price.andO;According to Frebis, digitizing each quadrant map for storage in the system'sdatabase consumed about two days.andM;The company is currently in the process of upgrading its GIS.andP;  One of thecompany's main goals in constructing a new system is to decentralize thestorage and management of geographic data, which takes place on the company'snatural resource department VAX.andP;  &quot;With the current system, all graphicqueries from other departments come to natural resources,&quot; Frebis said.andM;The new system will move the company's GIS from the VAX to a distributed GISenvironment based on Integraph's Series 6000 InterServe model 6105.andP;  All ofthe workstations, except for the InterView 68000, will be replaced withIntegraph InterPro 6280 workstations.andM;The InterServe model 6105 includes a 14-MIPS CPU, 32MB of dynamic RAMexpendable to 256MB), a 12-slot chassis and a 670MB disk drive.andP;  EachInterPro 6280 has a 50MHz RISC microprocessor, 16MB of main memory and a670MB disk drive.andM;Each workstation supports Intergraph's Edge II graphics capabilities.andP;  GulfStates Paper also will add a Versatech electrostatic plotter to the new GISconfiguration.andM;The GIS software will consist of Intergraph's Microstation GraphicsEnvironment as the basic query backbone and Microstation Graphics Analyst asthe spatial analysis component.andM;The replacement project will cost $433,000 ($282,000 for hardware, $138,000for software and $13,000 for user training to be conducted by Intergraph) andis slated for completion by late spring.andP;  Gulf States Paper is amortizing thenew equipment over five years.andM;Frebis estimated that the updated GIS' annual operating costs will remain atabout $250,000, but maintenance costs are expected to reach only $44,000 perannum.andP;  Frebis said the majority of the new system's savings will derive fromits lower annual maintenance costs.andP;  The previous system's replacement partswere costly, Frebis said, and the current GIS will offer better reliability.andM;Aside from managing graphics files, the old GIS' VAX DMRS database won't beused any longer.andP;  Gulf States Paper has opted to use the Oracle RDBMSinstead.andP;  Frebis said that because the DMRS system lacked an SQL interface,the command structure for accessing the database was &quot;extremely cryptic.&quot;andO;Gulf States Paper will transfer data they want to keep from the VAX to thenew Intergraph server.andP;  &quot;In the long run this will save money because ourdatabase will be better-defined, and users will be happier,&quot; Frebis said.andM;The new GIS is expected to increase productivity within the company's landinformation services department by 25 percent, which Frebis expects totranslate into an additional $30,000 per annum in gross revenues, mostly fromexternal business arrangements.andP;  Each week, the division performs nearly 300hours of outside digitizing work for other companies that have purchasedGISes.andM;Frebis expects the increased processing power of the new workstations toboost the department's productivity substantially.andP;  &quot;Each operator won't becompeting with others for resources,&quot; Frebis said.andP;  He added that thedepartment's updated GIS software should also cut overhead and increaseproductivity.andM;Frebis said the changeover will also make it easier to decentralize anddistribute data among the recreation, development and mineral departmentssometime in the future.andP;  &quot;The ultimate value of GIS is putting all of thedata in the hands of the actual users,&quot; Frebis said.andM;&quot;Spatial analysis will be easier with the new system because it will requirefewer manipulations,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We can say, 'Show me where any areas thatcontain more than 30 board feet of timber more than 20 years old within 500feet of a road are located.'&quot;andM;Frebis said the ultimate GIS implementation at Gulf States Paper, stillmerely a wish list item, would allow for greater data interchange.andM;For instance, it would let users in the recreation department access data andshow prime hunting areas to users in the development department.andM;But Frebis remains optimistic, noting that as soon as forestry personnel andwildlife biologists toiling in the paper company's vast acreage become morefamiliar with the beauties of spatial analysis, it will only be a matter oftime before the departments become fully interconnected.andM;ALASKAN GIS LINEandM;Dick Trager, a planning director for the Kenai Peninsula borough outside ofSoldotna, Alaska, purchased a turnkey GIS system from McDonnell-Douglas tocreate a base map for the borough's land planning and assessment needs.andM;&quot;[Kenai Peninsula] is an area that covers 256,000 square miles,&quot; Trager said.andO;&quot;You could put our borough on top of Boston and it would run out intoPennsylvania.&quot;andP;  The borough hasn't fully explored all potential uses for itsGIS system because programmers are still building the system's database, hesaid.andM;&quot;Our biggest challenge--converting the data--is dependent on our next biggestchallenge, which is obtaining [government] funding to keep the system alive,&quot;he said.andM;Software and related costs for the GIS system, including operating systemsoftware, a McDonnell-douglas GIS called the Graphic Design System, Oracle'sRDBMS, training, installation and consulting, initially came to $260,635.andM;For hardware, the borough initially installed three VAXstation 2000s, thenupgraded to VAXstation 3100s.andP;  The VAXstations are connected to a MicroVAX3500 file server equipped with two RA81 disk drives.andP;  The two drives arecurrently at 70 percent to 80 percent of their capacity: Trager has plans topurchase an RA90 to complete the project.andP;  The three VAXstations and theMicroVAX 3500 each have 16MB of memory.andM;Other hardware purchases included VT220 terminals for data input and aCalcomp electrostatic plotter.andP;  The total hardware outlay thus came to$211,627, Trager said.andP;  Maintenance costs will be approximately $80,000 for1990 for both hardware and software, he added.andM;Trager originally budgeted $607,000 for six programmers working in two shiftsfor three years to create the map database.andP;  Of that sum, $229,000 wasbudgeted for fiscal year 1990.andP;  Because labor costs were higher than Tragerhad anticipated, he spent $195,000 for three programmers in fiscal year 1990.andM;Although the GIS isn't completed, Trager said the borough administration isalready benefiting from its system.andM;&quot;Even though we haven't yet received a very big payoff because we don't haveall the data in there, we are managing our borough homelands much betterbecause of the information that's already in the computer,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;The biggest thing is to get the governing agency to commit to the programfrom inception until it's in final production mode,&quot; he added.andP;  Trager alsoadvised MIS managers not to underestimate the time and money it will take toconvert manually.andP;  &quot;and you need to have your organization in place,&quot; hesaid.andM;&quot;We though we'd bring in other departments later on, but we should have hadthe organizational structure up front.andP;  They could have helped pay forit--after the fact is kind of tough.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
