The Pentagon said the brief meeting between Cheney and WalterWallmann, minister president of the West German state of Hesse, wasa courtesy visit.   Wallmann's office said the session was the beginning of a roundof meetings dealing with possible reductions in U.S. militarystrength in Germany.   Wallmann's position as minister president of Hesse is similar tothat of governor of an American state. Hesse includes a number ofU.S. military installations, including V Corps headquarters atFrankfurt and large concentrations at the famous Fulda Gap leadinginto East Germany.   Wallmann planned to discuss the social effects of possible U.S.troop withdrawal, what happens to German civilians working for theU.S. military and the future of Wiesbaden-Erbenheim Army airfield,his office said.   The United States wants more combat helicopters and other Armyaircraft stationed at the field, but is meeting opposition fromlocal residents complaining of aircraft noise.   Frankfurt officials have suggested turning Erbenheim into acivilian expansion of Rhein-Main Airport, which is shared bycivilian airliners and the U.S. military.   Cheney was leaving Monday for a two-day meeting of the NATODefense Planning Committee in Brussels, Belgium.   Wallmann also was to meet with National Security Adviser BrentScowcroft. On Tuesday, aides said, he is scheduled to meet withLawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state.</TEXT></DOC>
