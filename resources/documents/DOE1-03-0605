EBR-II is a complete electricity-producingpower plant now in its twenty-fourth year of successful operation. Duringthis long history the reactor has had several concurrent missions, suchas demonstration of a closed Liquid-Metal Reactor (LMR) fuel cycle (1964-69);as a steady-state irradiation facility for fuels and materials (1970onwards); for investigating effects of operational transients on fuelelements (from 1981); for research into the inherent safety aspects ofmetal-fueled LMR's (from 1983); and, most recently, for demonstrationof the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) concept using U-Pu-Zr fuels. Thispaper describes experience gained at EBR-II in defining lifetime limitsfor LMR core components, particularly fuel elements.</TEXT></DOC>
