The Villain Who Deceived or Hero Who Obeyed?---By John WalcottStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST LATAMAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a recent survey, the readers of Washingtonian magazine named Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North the No. 1 villain of the year. They also named the former National Security Council aide the leading hero of 1987.    When President Reagan fired him last November, Col. North's major sin appeared to be an excess of patriotic zeal. But more than seven months of investigations have shredded his reputation, revealing a pattern of lies, deceit, and possible law-breaking and leaving his inquisitors wondering whether to believe anything he says. The rest of the country will have a chance to make up its mind today when Col. North begins four days of testimony before the House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair.    But it's not clear which Ollie North the skeptical public will see on their television screens.    There is the daring, defiant warrior who believed and still believes that extremism in the pursuit of President Reagan's foreign policy goals was no vice. That's the Col. North who refused to let the Congress, the bureaucracy -- and possibly the law -- stand in the way of his attempts to win the freedom of American hostages in Lebanon and to keep the Nicaraguan Contras alive.    But there also is a humble, sometimes contrite professional soldier who continues to insist that he has never acted without the approval of his superiors. When he has overstepped his orders, this Col. North will look his accusers straight in the eye and admit that he erred. He made a brief appearance before the House Foreign Affairs Committee last November and, biting his lip and swallowing his emotions, declared: &quot;No one in this country wants to tell his story as much as I do.&quot;    Members of the Iran-Contra committees expect the humble Col. North to return today. &quot;I doubt very much whether he's going to come in as a swashbuckling lieutenant colonel very much in charge and full of bravado,&quot; says Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine, a member of the Senate panel. &quot;My instinct tells me he'll come in very low-key, saying, 'Yes, sir' and 'No, sir.'&quot;    But if the contrite Col. North does appear, he'll have to explain why the swashbuckling Ollie bought snow tires and groceries with traveler's checks meant for the Contras, apparently forged letters to conceal a gift of a $16,000 security system at his suburban Virginia home, and allegedly allowed his private partners in the Iran-Contra affair to create a $200,000 trust fund for his wife and four children.    Oklahoma Democratic Sen. David Boren, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Iran-Contra panel, started out believing Col. North was a zealot who would lie only if telling the truth would endanger his cause. Now, after the mushrooming revelations about Col. North's personal finances and his efforts to doctor and destroy records of the administration's secret dealings, Sen. Boren says: &quot;In my own mind, I'm not sure who Oliver North was. . . . I certainly don't think people are going to accept what he says at face value.&quot;    GOP Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, a stalwart supporter of Contra aid and one of the administration's staunchest defenders on the House investigative committee, says he is &quot;very disappointed&quot; in Col. North. &quot;Why not go borrow the money for the security system? Why go into phony bills and phony letters? . . . I am making a special effort to hear his side of it, but some of these things appear to be indefensible.&quot;    Those who don't know Col. North wonder how a lieutenant colonel in a mid-level White House job could manipulate ambassadors, generals and cabinet officers. But those who know him and dealt with him understand, at least partially, his power. Col. North was a 19th century romantic, a throwback to a time when Americans damned the torpedos and did what had to be done, untroubled by what Congress, the media or anyone else said.    If things went wrong, he told his colleagues at the NSC, he would &quot;take the pipe&quot; for Ronald Reagan. His crusades against terrorism and the Sandinistas attracted a small legion of acolytes, including his secretary, Fawn Hall, who remarked that &quot;sometimes you have to go above the written law.&quot;    But Col. North also was a talented manipulator who knew how to play bureaucrats and reporters off against one another and who could turn on either a sharp self-deprecating wit or a kind of naughty-boy charm. He was the Eagle Scout who walked his grandmother across the street, then dared you to dash through the railroad tunnel with him. To say no to Ollie was to chicken out.    Like others involved in the Iran-Contra scandal, he also lied. He exaggerated his closeness to the president and he tried to plant &quot;pre-emptive leaks&quot; of false or misleading information. He apparently concocted one especially colorful tale -- that members of the Polish trade union Solidarity had hijacked Soviet weapons and passed them to the Contras -- to conceal the fact that his secret aid network was buying arms for the Contras in Poland.    At one point, he congratulated an aide for peddling a bogus report that the April 1986 bombing raid on Libya had been canceled. &quot;Ollie made up so many stories that I think he lost the ability to tell where fact ends and fantasy begins,&quot; says one former colleague. &quot;Ollie is starring in his own movie,&quot; former White House spokesman Larry Speakes once observed.    Col. North's cynicism about government was fired by the succession of national debacles that began in Vietnam and continued through the humiliating attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran, the Marines' tragic stay in Lebanon, the erratic support for the Contras, the botched invasion of Grenada, and the internal wrangling that paralyzed the administration's self-proclaimed war against terrorism.    &quot;The Army can't shoot, the Navy can't sail, and the Air Force can't fly,&quot; Col. North frequently said.    &quot;The guy does have a point,&quot; argues Noel Koch, who resigned as the Pentagon's top counterterrorism expert after banging his head against the same walls Col. North tried to climb over, sneak around, or tunnel under. &quot;The problems were real, and every time you had a new terrorist incident they got worse. Ollie simply was well-placed to act, and he acted.&quot;    For example, after a band of Armenian terrorists seized the Turkish Embassy in Lisbon in 1983, killing a diplomat's wife and a Portuguese policeman, President Reagan declared that &quot;this senseless violence must end.&quot; Mr. Koch, sensing an opportunity to force the bureaucracy to take terrorism more seriously, called Col. North. &quot;I'm already moving on it,&quot; the NSC aide said. Within a month, the first draft of a presidential directive ordering tough new measures to combat terrorism was circulating.    &quot;He knew how to cut through bureaucracy and get things done,&quot; says Sen. Cohen. &quot;You cannot put a person with those qualities in a position of authority and then say, 'We didn't know he was going to do these things.' . . . They cannot dump everything on Oliver North's back.&quot;    Col. North &quot;is the type of guy who comes up with something new every day,&quot; says Sen. Boren. &quot;He's the kind of guy who constantly needs to have the reins pulled in. . . . The difference between a loose cannon and a constructive employee is supervision.&quot;    Whatever little supervision Col. North had began to disintegrate after his friend and mentor, Robert McFarlane, resigned as national security adviser near the end of 1985. Mr. McFarlane's successor, Vice Adm. John Poindexter, made a half-hearted attempt at packing Col. North off to the Naval War College, but the investigations of the Iran-Contra affair to date haven't revealed a single instance of Adm. Poindexter vetoing a proposal from Col. North.    Nor is there any evidence that the other top official close to Col. North, the late Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey, sought to restrain him. Another top official who might have been able to rein him in, deputy national security adviser Donald Fortier, told friends early last year that some of Col. North's activities frightened him. But Mr. Fortier died of cancer last August.    Col. North had real power and he was surrounded by its perquisites, including a satellite beeper that once went off on the Eastern shuttle midway between New York and Washington. His traveling companions were no longer underpaid military officers or civil servants, but private businessmen who stood to make millions by opening doors in Iran.    &quot;The temptations became irresistible at that point,&quot; says Sen. Cohen. &quot;First you take a little for the tires and for food, then a $16,000 gate.&quot;    At the end, perhaps the officer and patriot may have sensed that the swashbuckler had gotten ends and means hopelessly confused. After President Reagan fired him on national television, a friend found Col. North sitting alone in his office. &quot;I'm sorry, Ollie,&quot; the friend said. &quot;Don't be,&quot; Col. North replied. &quot;I'm glad it's over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
