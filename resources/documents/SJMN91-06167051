They applied for an additional $104,000 mortgage so they couldbuild a &quot;chicken house&quot; to supply broiler chickens to a local chickenprocessor. David, a bank loan officer, orally informed the borrowers theirloan had been approved. Relying on this approval, they moved utility lines,graded a hay field for the new building, and tore down their old chickenhouse.;    But about two months later the borrowers received a letter from thebank informing them that their loan request had been rejected. Since theycould not obtain other financing, the chicken processor withdrew its contractto buy the chickens, the borrowers defaulted on their old mortgage becausethey used their own funds to start construction, Robert left the farm andLettie suffered migraine headaches. The borrowers sued the bank for damagesdue to negligent misrepresentation. But the bank replied it has no obligationto the borrowers since the Statute of Frauds requires that a contract to lendmoney be in writing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WHEN BANK SAYS 'YES' TO LOAN IT BETTER BEREADY TO DELIVER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Real EstateLawBased on the 1990 Texas Court of Appeals decision in Federal Land BankAssociation of Tyler vs. Sloane, 793 S.W. 2d 692.

Since theborrowers relied on David's oral loan approval, the bank's later rejectionmeans David made a negligent misrepresentation, the judge said.;    As aresult of the evidence presented, William, Lettie and Robert are entitled tobe paid $31,639.83 for mental anguish, monetary losses and prejudgmentinterest, the judge ruled.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ROBERT J.
