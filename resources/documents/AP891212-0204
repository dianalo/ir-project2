Analysts on Monday praised ATandamp;T's cost-slashing, which they saidshould help the company improve profitability.   ``It's really demonstrating that a very, very significantcultural change is going on within ATandamp;T. Bob Allen (the chairman)is recognizing that the ultimate boss is the shareholder,'' saidCharles Nichols, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst.   The cuts were less popular with ATandamp;T's largest union, theCommunications Workers of America, which said customer service wasbound to suffer. It said ATandamp;T was being short-sighted by cuttingskilled employees at a time when labor shortages are developing.   ``We can only conclude that ATandamp;T cares more about cutting costsin the short run than about building revenue for the long run,''said Gaye Williams Mack, a union spokeswoman.   ATandamp;T stock rose 75 cents to $44.37{ a share on the New YorkStock Exchange.   ATandamp;T has been eliminating jobs steadily since the Bell Systembreakup of Jan. 1, 1984, when the local phone companies were splitoff into seven regional companies known as the Baby Bells.Employment fell from 373,000 then to 297,000 by the end of October1989.   About half the cuts have come through layoffs and half throughretirements and other voluntary separations, spokesman BurkeStinson said.   Stinson said he estimates the total reduction in 1989 will endup at about 22,000 to 23,000 jobs and said the drop could range ashigh as 25,000 depending on the number of voluntary separations.   Modernization is one big reason for the cuts. Automatedswitching technology has allowed ATandamp;T to cut its ranks of operatorsdrastically. Also, many employees who operated, installed andserviced phone equipment are being phased out as the companychanges to high-tech digital equipment.   Another reason for cuts is that ATandamp;T was overstaffed before thebreakup. It could afford extra layers of employees as long as itwas a monopoly, but rising competition since the breakup has forcedit to pare down.   ATandamp;T's aggressiveness in cutting costs is matched by a newdetermination to fight back in the long-distance business againstMCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., itsclosest rivals.   Nichols said he expects those companies to continue eating intoATandamp;T's share of the market, but far more slowly than in the pastfew years. The company also is battling rivals in sales of networkswitching equipment, office phone systems and computers.   A sign of ATandamp;T's tough-guy approach was its recent victoryagainst Asian makers of small-business phone systems. TheInternational Trade Commission ruled on a company complaint thatphone systems from Japan and Taiwan were being ``dumped'' in theUnited States at unfairly low prices and ordered special tariffs onthem.   ATandamp;T last week told analysts it planned to cut 6,000 jobs nextyear in the Network Services division, which runs the long-distancenetwork. It also plans to cut 700 in Business CommunicationsSystems, 1,400 in Material Management and Services, and 400 inGeneral Business Systems.   The largest portion of the 1989 cuts came from ATandamp;T's firstdrive to cut middle management through sweetened pension offeringsfor those who accepted early retirement. About 12,000 to 13,000managers have chosen early retirement under that program.   Two thousand other managers left before that incentive programbegan. The company also cut 5,000 operators and says it expects tocut other jobs through normal attrition, possibly as many as 6,000.</TEXT></DOC>
