The not-so-good news is thathe appears on the screen less than 10 minutes.   Yes, he looks bulky, resembling Raymond Burr in his courtroomrobe. Yes, he affects a British accent (how he loves props) thatdrew an initial titter from the preview audience. But no, theBrando magnetism has not diminished in his long layoff. He remainsa dominating force.   Like ``Cry Freedom'' and ``A World Apart,'' ``A Dry WhiteSeason'' was filmed in Zimbabwe and looks at South Africa'sapartheid from a white viewpoint. The central figure is DonaldSutherland, a teacher at an exclusive white boy's school. He isvaguely unsettled by the signs of oppression all around him and bythe tacit agreement with the government's policy by his family andfellow faculty members.   Apartheid strikes close to Sutherland when his son's playmateand the boy's father are kidnapped, tortured and murdered by theSpecial Police. He enlists the help of the shadowy Zakes Mokae, ataxi driver with good connections; Susan Sarandon, a liberalreporter; and a noted defense lawyer, played by Brando.   Sutherland's efforts to seek justice are thwarted, and he loseshis job, his wife, his standing in the white community and more.Even his own daughter betrays him. Only one element of hoperemains: He has inculcated his young son with a sense of outrage atthe vicious repression of the South African regime.   The sure-handed direction of Euzhan Palcy (``Sugar Cane Alley'')and her talent for drawing the best from actors infuse ``A DryWhite Season'' with suspense despite the inevitability of theoutcome. She is superb at the handling of action scenes such as themassacre of children at Soweto, focusing on individual humantragedy. Her only annoying technique is the use of extremecloseups, especially on minor characters.   Sutherland is perfect as the rational man whose growing fury atthe regime's atrocities forces him to take action. Equallyeffective are Janet Suzman as his icy, unsupportive wife; SusanSarandon as the fearless reporter; and Jurgen Prochnow (``DasBoot''), as the embodiment of evil as the Special Police officer.   The African actors bring substance and authenticity to the film,especially Zakes Mokae as Sutherland's underground source, andWinston Ntshona as the murdered boy's father. Both are SouthAfrican exiles who have brought the anti-apartheid message to theLondon and New York theaters.   In Brando's two scenes, he re-emphasizes his position as themost exciting film actor of his time. Let's hope that his recentannouncement of another retirement was another Brando prank.   The MGM-UA release was produced by Paula Weinstein and is ratedR for language and brutal action. Running time: 106 minutes.</TEXT><TEXT>   Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:   G _ General audiences. All ages admitted.   PG _ Parental guidance suggested.
