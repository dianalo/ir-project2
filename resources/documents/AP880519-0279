Southwest Savings Association, the state's 18th largest thrift,agreed to acquire 78 offices and branches of the four troubled Sandamp;Ls.   The plan, announced Wednesday, may be the largest merger in thefederal Southwest Plan designed to rescue the state's ailingthrifts, officials said.   The four thrifts to be acquired within the next year areStockton Savings Association of Addison, Lamar Savings Associationof Austin, the state's 11th largest Sandamp;L, City Savings and LoanAssociation of San Angelo and Briercroft Savings Association ofAustin, said George M. Barclay, president of the Federal Home LoanBank of Dallas.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will spend a record$2 billion on the deal over a 10-year period, Barclay said.   Southwest is contributing $25 million of subordinated debt tothe consolidated company as equity, but no outside capital will beused.   The thrifts have combined assets of more than $4 billion, 75percent of which are in commercial and ``non-conventional'' realestate, and combined deposits of more than $4.4 billion, Barclaysaid.   ``There's no desire to create mega-thrifts,'' Barclay said.``But when you absorb four institutions, you've got a lot of workin front of you. We don't have much larger institutions so we don'tanticipate much larger transactions.''   Barclay said even though the merger will begin with a large,116-branch outfit, Southwest will quickly begin shutting down itsduplicated services.   ``Within six months of the transaction, Southwest will make asubstantial reduction in branches, especially where there isduplication,'' he said.   C. Todd Miller, chairman and chief executive of SouthwestSavings, said the company planned to substantially reduce thenumber of branches.   ``We don't know how many branches we will close,'' Miller said.But he said customers of all the thrifts will be notified of branchclosings by mail.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has now resolved the problemsof eight Texas thrifts under the Southwest Plan, which wasannounced by the board in February and initiated last week.   The Southwest Plan goal is to fold 109 or more insolvent Sandamp;Lsinto 25 to 30 surviving institutions. Last year, Congress grantedthe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. authority to raise upto $10.8 billion from the industry to fund recapitalization ofsurviving thrifts.   The merger of four ailing thrifts into Houston-based CoastalBanc Savings was the first consolidation under the Southwest planin a transaction that involved a $138 million contribution from theFSLIC. That transaction included $3.5 million from a privateinvestment group.   ``All of these transactions will be unique,'' Barclay said.``This one doesn't include outside capital. Some transactions inthe future will have significant outside capital.''   As part of its assistance in the deal, the FSLIC will provideSouthwest Savings with a 10-year note worth about $483 million.   In exchange, the FSLIC will receive warrants to purchase 50percent of Southwest's common stock. The FSLIC will receive 90percent of Southwest Savings' first $60 million in profits.   David Colgren, a spokesman for the FHLB, said officials believeSouthwest Savings will show a profit within two years.   Stockton Savings had total assets as of March 31 of $543 millionwith a net worth of negative $347.7 million and deposits of $784million.   Lamar Savings Association, the object of a lawsuit filed by theFSLIC for regulatory violations, has total assets of $1.9 billion,a net worth of negative $331.9 million and deposits of $2.1 billion.   City Savings and Loan Association has assets of $687.3 million,a net worth of negative $221.9 million and deposits of $866.2million. Briercroft has total assets of $868.1 million, a net worthof negative $22.7 million and deposits of $658 million.   Before Wednesday's purchase, Southwest Savings had total assetsof $1.48 billion, a net worth of $27.6 million and deposits of $998million.
