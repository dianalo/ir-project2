But instead of being an earnest effort to end theoften-violent walkout that began March 2, Amalgamated TransitUnion officials acknowledged that the action was a legaltactic aimed at setting the stage for a potentially hugeback-pay claim against the struggling unit of GLI Holding Co.</LP><TEXT>   The offer, made in a letter to the company, comes one weekafter the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaintalleging that Greyhound had engaged in an unfair laborpractice in contract negotiations with the ATU.   Greyhound has promised to fight that complaint through thefederal courts if necessary, but if unfair bargainingpractices and not economic issues are ultimately found tohave caused the strike, the company could be forced to rehirestriking drivers and pay them for time lost during thestrike.   &quot;In order to start the clock on back pay running, we haveto make an unconditional offer to return to work,&quot; said EarlePutnam, ATU general counsel. &quot;That is what the (union) hasdone.&quot;   &quot;They have done what was smart and that's a first,&quot; saidP. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound executive vice president andchief labor negotiator. He estimated the company's back payliability at about $13.6 million a month.   Mr. Lannie said Greyhound would offer its remaining jobopenings to striking union members under the terms of a May 5contract offer rejected by the union. &quot;But the bottom line isthat we just don't have many vacancies left,&quot; he said.   Since the strike by 9,400 ATU members began, Greyhound hasstruggled to operate a slightly smaller regular-route systemwith a work force that now includes 598 union drivers whocrossed picket lines and 3,177 newly hired replacementdrivers.   Although Greyhound could need as many as 500 additionaldrivers in the event of a busy summer travel season, companyspokesman George Gravley said Greyhound has openings for only108 full-time drivers now, and 98 of those positions are partof a local transit contract that expires July 1.   The union's offer comes a day after Greyhound said itwould offer to redeem about $191 million in face amount ofdebt for about $86 million. Some bond analysts said theunion's move could make it more difficult for debt-burdenedGreyhound, which has already suffered huge losses from thestrike, to finance the tender offer.   &quot;It does have a negative impact on the company's abilityto raise the financing,&quot; said Leigh Walzer, a bond analystwith R.D. Smith andamp; Co. &quot;Now, anyone who would put the newmoney into Greyhound, aside from the other economic risksthey face, has to worry about a back-pay claim that the unioncould win down the road.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
