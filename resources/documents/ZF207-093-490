'' Saal said of his conversations with the venturecapitalists.andM;But the last few years have brought networking into the public domain, andwith the increased attention has come a new interest on the part ofinvestors.andM;Saal is one of many entrepreneurs who have persisted in their conviction thatthe technology to connect disparate computer systems will become essential.andO;Lately, Saal has found himself turning away potential backers.andP;  Littlewonder: Though the first venture fumbled, his latest company, Network GeneralCorp., earlier this month realized every investor's dream -- the elusiveinitial public offering.andM;A few prescient investors have already reaped millions by backing theindustry's first successes, such as Ungermann-Bass Inc., Novell Inc. andBridge Communications Inc., now part of 3Com Corp.andM;Now they're expanding their commitments, and others are joining the fray.andM;Data and telecommunications firms claimed $390 million of the nearly $4billion invested by 627 U.S.andP;  venture-capital firms in 1987, according toVenture Economics Inc., a market researcher in Needham, Mass.andP;  Enterprisessuch as telecommunications-oriented Abacus Ventures have been createdspecifically to invest in the field.andM;''It's one of the few safe bets,'' said Jim Anderson, a general partner inMerrill, Pickard, Anderson andamp; Eyre, a leading venture-capital firm that hasbacked two of the industry's most successful start-ups, Bridge Communicationsand Network Equipment Technologies Inc.andM;These days, more and more of the industry's most celebrated names are joiningnew networking companies.andM;Among them are Ken Oshman, who founded Rolm Corp., Enzo Torresi, who presidedover Businessland Inc., and Torresi's new partner, A.C.andP;  Markkula, Jr., AppleComputer Inc.'s first chief executive officer.andM;''When you get names like Oshman and Markkula .andP;  .  .  you've got to thinkthat something is happening,'' said Richard Schaeffer, the editor ofTechnologic Computer Letter, which tracks investments in the computerindustry.andM;Among the networking technologies attracting the most attention, are thosedesigned specifically to serve larger work groups than are common today.andO;Fiber optics, for example, is popular because it permits transmission speedsthat will significantly increase the amount of data that can be transferredbetween different systems.andP;  Also regarded favorably are technologies thatexploit emerging standards, or protocols, such as Open SystemsInterconnection.andM;The last few years have brought significant advances in the physicalconnection of networks, particularly as international or de facto standardshave achieved a wider acceptance among major vendors, such as IBM and DigitalEquipment Corp.andM;Small firms are beginning to be able to assume that the major players willadhere to international standards.andP;  In addition, startups have the advantageof being able to develop products faster than their much larger competitors.andO;For venture capitalists, this combination augurs prosperity.andM;''There are more opportunities to build $100 million companies,'' saidAnderson, ''because the barriers are coming down.''andM;And, finally, the built-in demand for data communications is expected tosoar.andP;  That inspires confidence in venture capitalists, who've grownaccustomed to forecasts of slackening demand in the computer market.andM;''The units of PCs sold can fall off,'' said Andy McLane, a partner with TAAssociates, a Boston-based venture-capital firm that invests about $20million annually in networking businesses.andP;  ''But there's this huge installedbase out there now that needs to be connected.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
