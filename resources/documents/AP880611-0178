Wilburn says he has led paying hunters on six lion safaris thisyear at his 400-acre island about 40 miles east of Houston. Hewon't say where he got the lions.   Government officials became involved when two lion carcasseswere found on government land across a roughly half-mile-wideshallow river from Wilburn's isolated island. The government landis intended for a reservoir and was being managed by the corps.   At least one lion was believed to have been released, hunted andskinned on government property, said Charles Craddock, a corpsranger who usually monitors compliance with grazing and oilfieldleases.   Federal officials were unnerved by the idea of lions roamingfree followed by hunters with high-powered weapons on land usuallyused by duck hunters and nature buffs.   ``I had a long talk with him,'' Craddock said. ``He indicated tome that he was not going to hunt any more lions down there.''   Opposition to such lion hunts has come from as far away as WestGermany, said Patricia Mercer, executive director of the Societyfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Houston.   ``People are appalled that something like this could happen,''she said. ``It's becoming a common problem across the U.S. with asurplus of lions, who breed well in captivity.''   In the absence of regulations specifically forbidding lion huntson private land, authorities fined Wilburn $125 for disposing of ananimal carcass on government land and conducting a business forprofit on government property, White said.   In addition, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ranger whoaccompanied Craddock to Wilburn's taxidermy shop April 29 finedWilburn $110 for not having a license to mount migratory wildfowl.   The lions Wilburn used probably were bred in the United States,said Jim Stinebaugh, senior resident U.S. Fish and Wildlifeenforcement agent for south Texas. He added, ``once they're here,they can be bought, sold, killed, whatever.''   Under state law, even African lions are not considered wildliferesources and therefore are not protected from hunters, said PhilEvans, a regulatory coordinator for the Texas Parks and WildlifeDepartment.   The lions were brought to the island in cages, released and thentracked across the private property in hunts lasting as little as20 minutes, Wilburn said. His price list for the hunts ranged from$2,500 to $3,000.   ``Once that lion is released, there is no catching him backagain,'' he said. ``I'm obligated to kill him. I can't have theliability of a lion running around.   ``They made it sound like we were releasing lions in that partof the country, hoping we'd find them,'' Wilburn said. ``When thecat was released, it never left our sight.''   Wilburn said his customers had no preconceived notions about thehunt on the island, which is covered by low vegetation.   ``They knew they weren't in Africa, they knew they weren'thunting for a free lion,'' he said. ``If they wanted that, theycould go to Africa.''</TEXT></DOC>
