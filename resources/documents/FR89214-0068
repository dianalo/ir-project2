Justification for the Proposed Survey</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">1. <T3>Reason Information is Needed</T3>Under a cooperative arrangement organized by the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) and as authorized in section 502 g Title V of the Housingand Urban Development Act of 1970,\1\<NOTE/> the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) hascoordinated periodic surveys of the mortgage lending and commitment activityof the principal groups of financial institutions actively involved inthe mortgage market. In addition to providing the Secretary, in his roleas the President's principal housing advisor, information on the currentstatus of the mortage lending activity, the data collected is used by:The Federal Reserve (flow of funds), Treasury (state ceilings for mortgagerevenue bonds), BEA (national income accounts), Congress, FHLBB, FNMA,and OMB itself.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ``The Secretary is authorized to request and receive suchinformation or data as he deems appropriate from private individuals andorganizations, and from public agencies. Any such inforamtion or data shallbe used only for the purposes for which it is supplied, and no publicationshall be made by the Secretary whereby the information or data furnishedby any particular person or establishment can be identified, except withthe consent of such person or establishment.''Congress declared an intention, in section 301, Title III of the NationalHousing Act to establish a secondary market for home mortgages. In order``to provide a degree of liquidity for mortgage investments, thereby improvingthe distribution of investment capital available for home mortgage financing''Congress, in section 302 of the above title created two corporations, theGNMA and the FNMA. Both of these corporations, subject to various restrictionsand overseen by the Secretary of HUD, were authorized to engage in thepurchase and sale of home mortgages. They were joined by the FHLMC, (establishedby FHLMC Act) in 1976.Since 1980 the extent and complexity of the secondary mortgage market hasincreased dramatically. The number and kind of securities have increasedfrom basic government-issued pass through mortgage pools to include privatepools, CMO's, REMICs and Stripped securities. Between 1980 and 1987 theannual volume of activity in this market has grown from $78 billion to$428 billion; an increase of 449 percent. Sales on the secondary marketaccounted for 64 percent of mortgage loans closed on all types of propertiesin 1987.With the integration of the mortgage market into the capital market, accurateinformation pertaining to the ultimate source of funds for Housing cannotbe obtained from examination of the traditional mortgage lenders. In recognitionof this HUD has initiated quarterly surveys (already approved by OMB) ofthe mortgage backed security and mortgage-oriented agency coupons of publicand private pension funds and life insurance companies. However two majorholders of mortgage backed securities are not being surveyed. Commercialand Savings Banks and Savings and Loans Associations.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Currently no plans exist to conduct a survey of Savingsand Loan institutions. Initially it was our understanding that the FHLBBwas going to undertake to gather such information. At present we have submittedseveral suggestions for additions to FHLBB `Thrift Financial Report ofCondition' Schedule SC which is currently under being modified. If oursuggestions are taken, the information obtained by the Bank Board willbe barely sufficient to compare with the date that we hope to have forall other institutions.Commercial and Savings Banks are major holders of mortgage backed securities.As of the March 1987 Call report, commercial bank holdings of mortgagepools had a book value of $83.8 billion and savings bank holdings of mortgagepools had a book value of $4.3 billion. The mortgage backed security holdingsof the banking industry are expected to increase over the next few yearsas the risk based capital holding requirements mandated by the three federalbank regulatory authorities \3\<NOTE/> are phased in.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The risk based capital holding requirements have beenjointly drafted and imposed by the Federal Reserve, the Computroller ofthe Currency, and the F.D.I.C.Currently banks have flat capital holding requirements. For each dollarof assets they must have a certain amount of capital. In general the bank'srisk of failure is thought to be inversely related to the capital/assetratio. Unfortunately, identical capital holding requirement on all assetsprovides banks with an incentive to hold more risky assets. Under the newrisk based requirements, each dollar of assets held is weighted accordingto which of five risk categories the asset is a member of. For every dollarof risk weighted dollar a set amount of capital must then be held. Theweighing is believed to be positively related with the level of risk.Mortgage related instruments are accorded very favorable treatment underthese new guidelines. GNMA securities, and all derivative instuments collateralizedby GNMA securities require no capital holdings whatsoever. FNMA and FHLMCsecurities, and all derivative instruments collateralized by them are assigneda 20% risk weight. Each dollar of such securities counts as only $.20 inthe determination of the capital holding requirements. Whole mortgages,and all privately issued mortgage conduit securities are assigned a 50%risk weight. Each dollar of such securities counts as only $.50 in thedetermination of the capital holding requirements. This favorable treatmentis expected to induce banks to increase their holdings of mortgage backedsecurities.\4\<NOTE/> By increasing the portion of such assets in its portfolioa bank moves toward meeting its capital requirements without additionalcapital.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ This statement is derived from a model in which banksmaximize their portfolio return (in which the costs of deposits entersnegatively), subject to the constraint imposed by capital holding requirements.Provided that mortgage backed assets are ``normal'' with respect to otherassets, than as the constraint cost of these assets declines relative toother assets, bank holdings of these assets will increase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">2. <T3>Use of Information by the Federal Government</T3>Section 501 Title V of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 authorizethe Secretary to undertake programs of research relating to the missionand programs of the Department that he deems necessary and appropriate.In section 301, Title III of the National Housing Act Congress declaresthat the ``purpose of the title is to establish a secondary market forhome mortgages.'' This market is thought to increase liquidity of homemortgages and therefore improve the distribution of investment capitalavailable for home mortgage financing. In order to evaluate the degreeof liquidity and evaluate the distribution of said capital, accurate informationon the mortgage security holding's of the major holders of these securitiesis necessary. In recognition of this, the Secretary requested that informationon the mortgage security holdings of banks, which are already large andare likely to become the largest, be obtained.As the principal Housing advisor to the President this information is importantin the evaluation of the state of the housing industry. Given this industry'ssensitivity to credit policies, and this industry's important role in overalleconomic performance such information will be useful in an economic macroeconomicpolicy perspective. Also the affordability of home-ownership and the problemof homelessness are currently emotionally charged issues. The likelihoodthat policy will be formulated to address these concerns is very high.Information that factually describes the availability and flow of fundsto housing industry will prove to be extremely valuable in crafting thesepolicies.This information will also be useful to the Secretary in his role as theAdministrator of GNMA and regulator of FNMA. Information regarding thebanking industry's demand for these securities is crucial in the determinationof the appropriate ceiling quantities of GNMA securities and the fees chargedon GNMA and FNMA securities. As FNMA needs the approval of the Secretaryof HUD and the Secretary of the Treasury for each REMIC issued, the informationprovided in the survey will be useful in the regulation of these securities.As bank demand for mortgage backed securities increase, it is likely thatGNMA, FNMA and FHLMC will aspire to craft securities that have attributesparticularly attractive to banks. The information acquired in this surveywill be useful in the construction of such financial instruments. In additionthis information will also aid the Secretary in his determination of whethersuch securities are congruent with the purposes and programs of the Department.Finally the information will prove useful to the Secretary in his evaluationof the growth of private mortgage conduits. Knowledge of the extent ofsuch issues and the identity of who holds such securities is crucial inthe determination of whether the federally sponsored mortgage conduit facilitiesare hindering the development of private mortgage conduit facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">4. andamp; 5. <T3>Duplication and Use of Existing Information</T3>The information that is being sought in this survey does not currentlyexist in another location. The Call Reports filed with the FDIC containssome of this information, but in too aggregate a form. All government mortgagepool securities (GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC) are aggregated together. Derivativeissues based on these pools are lumped with other government debt in general(Along with say Treasury securities). Similarly, private derivative instrumentsare aggregated with all private debt. Other securities issued by the threefederally sponsored secondary market facilities are distributed in aboutfive other possible categories throughout the call report.Neither FNMA, GNMA, nor FHLMC know who hold their securities, neither dothey know who hold the derivative securities based on their primary securities.However FHLMC has expressed great interest in knowing what the bank holdingsof their securities are.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">7. <T3>Reporting Frequency</T3>The quarterly frequency of this survey is chosen to coincide with the bank'spreparation of the call report. The coincidence of the collected data withthe call report will allow industry wide figures to be inferred on thebasis of the actual data contained in the call reports. Decreasing thefrequency of collected data would make it difficult to disentangle seasonalor other periodic cyclical fluctuation in the date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">9. <T3>Consultation With Persons Outside of the Agency</T3>Outside views were sought in the development of the survey with respectto the information to be collected and the clarity of instructions anddefinition of terms. A few potential respondents were consulted in orderto estimate the time it would require to complete the survey.The names of the individuals contacted were:<ITAG tagnum="15">Jack Goodman, Federal Reserve_452-2871.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Frank Nothaft, FHLMC_759-8019.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Richard Pickering, FHLBB_272-4957.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Norma Marshall, First Fidelity Bank_(201) 790-2280.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Jim Pratt, Hills Bank and Trust_(319) 679-2291.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">J.G.

It is assumed that theaverage compensation of the individual who will complete this survey isten dollars an hour. As there are four surveys a year the cost to eachfirm $6.60 per year. This amounts to a cost of $1102.20 per year to thebanking industry.Estimated quarterly cost to the government.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> I.

Change in Burden On April 13, 1988, OMB approved the continued use of Survey of PensionFunds, OMB No. 2052-0244, through August 31, 1989. This approval coveredan increase from 186 to 278 reporting burden hours so that the survey couldbe extended to cover state and local retirement systems. In our previoussubmission dated January 27, 1988, it was noted: ``In addition, the Secretaryof HUD has asked that a similar survey be conducted of commercial and mutualsavings banks.'' Plans for this additional effort have been finalized,including the sampling methodology, and drawing the actual sample. Thetotal number of responses has been increased to 586 for inclusion of commercialand mutual savings bank component, therefore the reporting burden has beenincreased by 113 hours. No change in the information collection is involvedother than the increase of the sample size.

Reporting Responses are expected to be received during the second month followingthe survey date (the survey date is the date forms are mailed on whichwill be the end of the quarter). The responses are edited, results tabulated,expanded to universe estimates during the third month, and the report written.The data is published four months following the survey date.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Collection of Information Employing Statistical Methods</ITAG>1. Statistical Universe The source of respondents for this survey is a data tape of the December1987 ``consolidated Reports of Condition and Income'' (hereafter referredto as the call report or ``the call''). This tape was obtained form theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This tape contains condition andincome records for 13,753 distinct commercial banks and 463 savings banks,i.e. the ``universe.''2. Sampling Methodology Examination of the condition reports reveal four variables which representmortgage backed security holdings of a bank. They are the book and marketvalue of holdings of government issues or guaranteed certificates of participationin pools of residential mortgages \6\<NOTE/> and the book and market values of holdings of certificatesof participation in pools of residential mortgages that are not governmentissued or guaranteed. These holdings will be referred to as public poolsand private pools, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Despite its current status as an independent corporationFNMA pools are considered government issued or guaranteed in the call report.The securities denoted by these holdings represent an actual ownershipinterest in the mortgages that comprise these pools. While these typesof securities represent a substantial portion of mortgage related securitiesthey are not inclusive. Lumped in with other U.S. debt and other privatedebt are the majority of the other mortgage related securities. These aresecurities that do not confer an ownership interest. Rather they are debtissues of another party who holds either the whole mortgage or a publicor private pool security. Such issues are represented by collateralizedmortgage obligations, (CMOs) and mortgage backed bonds. It is the non-explicitextent of these holdings in the call report which makes this survey necessaryto obtain precise information on the mortgage backed security holdingsof the banking system. It is assumed that a bank's propensity to hold mortgage pool holdings isa good indication of their propensity to hold other mortgage backed securities.\7\<NOTE/> Examination of the pool holdings across banks led to therejection of private pools as a possible guide in the sampling plan. Essentiallymost banks, 92% of commercial banks and 89% of savings banks, do not holdany private pools. Of the 1,035 commercial banks that hold some quantityof private pools 53% (555) hold under a million dollars worth and 44% (453)hold between one and fifty million dollars. Of the 51 savings banks thathold private pools 20% (10) hold under a million and 63% (31) hold betweenone and fifty million.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ As information will be gathered on the basis of book value,to avoid changes in portfolio value due to market swings, and to avoiddifferences in the calculation of market value it was decided to focuson book value rather than market value throughout this sampling exercise.The distribution of public pools, while skewed has considerably more bankswith positive holdings. Among commercial banks 48% (6,568) hold none, 20%(2,787) hold under a million dollars worth, 30% (4,243) hold between oneand fifty million, and 1% (155) hold over fifty million. Among savingsbanks 37% (173) do not hold any, 15% (71) hold under a million, 37% (175)hold between one and fifty million and 10% (46) hold over fifty million.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s100,r250,10,10</C> <H1>Strata No. </H1><H1>Definition </H1><H1>Number of case </H1><H1>Percent of total pools</H1>Strata for commercial banks:<ITAG tagnum="3">0</ITAG><D>No public pools</D><D>6,586</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">1</ITAG><D>1,000,000 to 10,000,000</D><D>4,786</D><D>19</D><ITAG tagnum="3">2</ITAG><D>10,000,000 to 100,000,000</D><D>652</D><D>22</D><ITAG tagnum="3">3</ITAG><D>100,000,000 to 500,000,000</D><D>73</D><D>24</D><ITAG tagnum="3">4</ITAG><D>G.T. 500,000,000</D><D>20</D><D>35</D>Strata for savings banks:<ITAG tagnum="3">0</ITAG><D>No public pools</D><D>1,736</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">1</ITAG><D>1,000,000 to 200,000,000</D><D>218</D><D>22</D><ITAG tagnum="3">2</ITAG><D>200,000,000 to 1,000,000,000</D><D>13</D><D>24</D><ITAG tagnum="3">3</ITAG><D>G.T. 1,000,000,000</D><D>4</D><D>54</D></ITAG>As the distribution was so highly skewed it was decided to stratify thedata on the book value of public pools.\8\<NOTE/> Five strata were defined for commercial banks and four forsavings banks. Shown in the tables below are the stratum numbers, the stratumdefinitions, the number of cases in each stratum and the percentage oftotal pool holdings held by commercial banks and savings banks in thatstratum.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The extent of all holdings are rounded to the nearestmillion dollars.The goal of the sample selection process was to select a sample that willproduce estimates of the total magnitude of the banking system's holdingsof mortgage related securities with a 5% margin of error with 99% confidence.Following Cochran \9\<NOTE/> (1964, p. 97,105) a Neymen allocation (minimum variance)requires a sample size of 123 commercial banks and 17 savings banks toproduce this degree of precision.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Cochran, William, <T3>Sampling Techniques, </T3>John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York, 1964The Neymen allocation scheme for commercial banks suggests that 37% ofthe sample (45 cases) should be allocated to stratum 4, 18% (22 cases)to stratum 3, 23% (29 cases) to stratum 2, and 22% (27 cases) to stratum1. The Neymen allocation for savings banks suggests 46% of the sample (8cases) be allocated to stratum 3, 22% (4 cases) to stratum 2, and 32% (5cases) to stratum 1. As there are only 20 cases in stratum four of commercialbanks and four in stratum three for savings banks the differences (45 minus20 and 8 minus 4) are proportionally allocated to the stratum 1 through3 for commercial banks and 1 and 2 for savings banks.When the actual survey sample is recruited it is unlikely that 100% ofthose whose recruitment is attempted will agree to participate. To acquirethe desired number in each stratum, rates of acceptance were assumed andthe attempt was made to recruit the reciprocal of these acceptance rates.The acceptance rate for the largest stratum (4 for commercial banks, 3for savings banks), the one where all members are selected is assumed tobe 100%. All of these institutions are large, with over a billion dollarsin total assets. Such banks are known (from the office's past experiencein the performance of bank surveys) to be very cooperative with governmentdata collection exercises.The next largest stratum consists of commercial banks with total assetsbetween $100 million and $1 billion with 92% of them having assets overone billion dollars and savings banks with total assets over $500 million.While a larger portion will probably respond an acceptance rate of 50%is chosen here for safety. For the remaining stratum an acceptance rateof 25% is assumed. Finally, for completeness, the mean value of the allocationof stratum 1 through 4 and one through three are allocated to stratum zeroof commercial banks and savings banks respectively.These acceptance rates dictate a sample draw of 466 commercial banks and68 savings banks to acquire the desired sample of 146 commercial banksand 23 savings banks. The allocation of banks to their respective stratumfor this recruitment effort is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <T4>Recruitment Draw</T4><H1>Stratum No.</H1><H1>No. cases commercial</H1><H1>No. cases saving</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">0<D>93</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>142</D><D>32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>152</D><D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>59</D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>20</D><D>_</D></ITAG></ITAG>This allocation should produce the following sample.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ When the actual recruitment was undertaken it was decidedto systematically sample every other bank in the selected sample of stratum0, 1 and 2 for commercial banks and 0 and 1 for savings banks. This amountsto a practical assumption that the response for recruitment in these stratawill be 50%. The actual recruitment process vindicated this assumption,producing a margin of approximately 10% in each strata.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s30,10,10</C> <T4>Expected Response</T4><H1>Stratum No.</H1><H1>No. cases commercial</H1><H1>No. cases saving</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">0<D>23</D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>36</D><D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>38</D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>29</D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>20</D><D>_</D></ITAG></ITAG>Such a sample of commercial banks was actually drawn using the pseudo-randomnumber generator in SPSS-X. This sample produced an estimated total ofpublic pools of $73,341.9 million (true value is $71,802 million). Thisrepresents an error of 2%, well within the desired 5%. The 95% confidenceband about this estimate is $67,541.08 million to $79,142.71 million.As a further test of the sample the private pool holdings of the bankingsystem were estimated from this sample. The estimated total was $8,085.34million (true value $10,094 million). Though the percentage error of 19%is considerably larger, the 95% confidence interval of this estimate, $4,216.84million to $11,953.84 million, includes the true value. As the variabilityof private pool holdings is known to be considerably greater than the variabilityof public pool holdings the larger percentage error in this case is notviewed as a problem.3. Method to Maximize ResponseIn order to maximize the response rate every bank in the sample is recruitedprior to any actual collection of data. This recruitment effort is mademost effective by personalizing each recruitment package. The name of thechief executive officer of every potential respondent bank was determined.Then a letter, signed by The Secretary, was sent to this named individual.The letter requests the bank's participation in the survey. In additiona sample survey form was sent so the extent of effort involved in participationcould be clearly evaluated.Those banks agreeing to participate are asked to return a response formin a provided envelope.
