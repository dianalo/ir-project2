Acting President F.W. de Klerk said police arrested nineguerrillas who planned violent disruptions of Wednesday'sparliamentary elections, which exclude blacks.   A bomb exploded Thursday night at a community center in amixed-race township outside Cape Town, police and witnesses said. Noone was seriously injured.   In Johannesburg, police banned a defiance rally at the Universityof the Witwatersrand, then fired repeated volleys of tear gas andrubber bullets at hundreds of students who reassembled each timethey were dispersed.   Police, who were seen charging through campus buildings in searchof protesters, said they arrested 10 blacks.   An estimated 5,000 mixed-race high school students in the cityboycotted classes to protest the elections.   Police raided the Johannesburg home and office of Jay Naidoo,general secretary of the militant Congress of South African TradeUnions, and later arrested about 10 members of the labor federationwho protested the action.   ``The raids ... were a blatant form of intimidation anddisruption of our legitimate activities,'' Naidoo said. ``At no timedid the police specify what offense they were investigating.''   The explosion near Cape Town rocked a community center housingoffices of an anti-apartheid organization in a mixed-race township,police and witnesses said. It occurred shortly after severalmeetings broke up in the building.   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which caused minordamage.   Also in Cape Town, 12 journalists protesting media regulationsunder the state of emergency were arrested. Nearby, about 25 blacksquatters were arrested outside a government office where they weredemanding improved services and an end to evictions.   In Durban, police detained five activists involved in planning aweekend protest by blacks on a whites-only beach. One of them,Curtick Ndlovu, is a senior official of the banned United DemocraticFront.   A police spokesman, Gen. Herman Stadler, said ``quite a number''of political activists had been detained without charge in the pasttwo days, but gave no details.   The UDF, the trade union congress and other major anti-apartheidorganizations said national protests of the elections would takeplace Tuesday and Wednesday.   Emergency regulations prohibit calls for general strikes, butprevious national protests have taken that form.   The groups also calls for a month-long consumer boycott startinga week after the elections.   De Klerk, in a speech at a police college, said nine guerrillasof the African National Congress and 10 collaborators had beenarrested in the past week.   He said police seized a ``big quantity'' of Soviet-made limpetmines, rifles and hand grenades which allegedly were to be used interrorist attacks to disrupt the election.   South Africa's Parliament includes segregated mixed-race andIndian chambers, as well as the dominant white chamber. Manyanti-apartheid leaders of all races oppose the elections because the28 million black majority is excluded.   Activists and police have clashed almost daily since the launchof a defiance campaign Aug. 2. The civil disobedience has includedprotests against whites-only schools, hospitals, beaches and buses.   Meanwhile, three blacks were killed in ongoing factional violencein Natal Province, police said. The conflict is between supportersof militant anti-apartheid groups and the more conservative Zulupolitical organization, Inkatha.</TEXT></DOC>
