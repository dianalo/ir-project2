The revised Part establishes policies andprocedures to implement the provisions of section 1401 of The Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub.

Section 306(A) of the RE Act dealswith the prepayment of certain loans held by the Federal Financing Bank(``FFB''), a wholly-owned government instrumentality under the supervisionof the Secretary of the Treasury, and guaranteed by REA. These revised regulations will implement section 1401 of OBRA and establishconditions under which REA guaranteed FFB loans may be prepaid by borrowerspursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 306(A) of the RE Act, onlyduring FY 1988, notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (c), (d),and (e) of section 306(A).The regulations also set forth procedures to prioritize prepayment applications.Priority will be given first to: (a) Those 8 borrowers that were determinedby the Administrator of REA, prior to December 22, 1987, to be eligibleto prepay, or prepaid an FFB loan pursuant to section 306(A); then to (b)other borrowers of loans made by the FFB and guaranteed by REA, on a firstcome-first served basis in the order in which borrowers are prepared todisburse funds to the FFB.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Interim Rule is effective January 27, 1988; written commentsmust be received by REA no later than (February 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Mr. Laurence V.

This regulation is issued in conformity with Executive Order 12291, FederalRegulations. It will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more; or (2) result in a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individuals, industries, Federal, state, or local governmentagencies or geographic regions; or (3) result in significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment or productivity, and has been determinednot to be ``major.'' This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this amended rule would notrepresent a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality ofthe human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969(42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment. This program is listedin the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance as 10.850, Rural ElectrificationLoans and Loan Guarantees and 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees.For the reasons set forth in the final rule related Notice to 7 CFR Part3015, Subpart V in 50 FR 47034, (November 14, 1985), this program is excludedfrom the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with state and local officials. <ITAG tagnum="84">Interim Rule With Request for Public Comment </ITAG>Pub. L. 100-203, The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 requiresthat implementing regulations be issued within 30 days after the date ofenactment, which was December 22, 1987. In order to meet the statutorydeadline for issuing implementing regulations and at the same time providethe public an opportunity to comment on the regulations, REA is issuingan interim rule with request for public comment. Since OBRA requires theseregulations to be issued within 30 days from December 22, 1987, and sincethe prepayment program under OBRA expires on September 30, 1988, REA findsthat good cause exists to make the interim rule effective upon publication,thereby enabling those borrowers having priority under OBRA to proceedwith a prepayment application during the 30 day public comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On January 14, 1987, REA published a Final Rule to add a new Part 1786to 7 CFR Chapter XVII. This rule set forth the REA policy and proceduresimplementing section 306(A) of the RE Act which permits an REA-financedelectric or telephone system to prepay an FFB loan (or any loan advancethere under) by paying the outstanding principal balance due on the loan(or advance), if: (a) The loan was outstanding on July 2, 1986; (b) Private capital, with the existing loan guarantee, is used to replacethe loan; and (c) The borrower certifies that any savings from such prepayment will bepassed on to its customers or used to improve the financial strength ofthe borrower in cases of financial hardship. Pursuant to subsection (c) of section 306(A) and the determination of theSecretary of the Treasury, that par prepayments of FFB loans have an adverseeffect on the operation of the FFB; the existing regulations limited prepaymentsduring FY 1987 to no more than $2.0175 billion. Furthermore, pursuant to subsection (d) of section 306(A), the existingregulations established eligibility criteria to ensure that the authorizedprepayments during FY 1987 were directed to the cooperative-type borrowersin the greatest need of the benefits associated with prepayment. The enactment of section 1401 of OBRA on December 22, 1987, permits a borrowerto prepay FFB pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 306(A), onlyduring FY 1988, notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (c), (d),and (e) of said section 306(A).   However section 1401(a) of OBRA provides that prepayments in excess of$2,000,000,000 during FY 1988 shall be subject solely to the approval ofthe Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury has determinedthat par prepayments in excess of $2,000,000,000 during FY 1988 will notbe approved. Par prepayment causes a measurable dollar loss to the Treasuryand thus to the U.S. taxpayer.  Section 1401(a) also allows rural electric and telephone borrowers to refinancetheir Federal Financing Bank loans in the private credit markets usingfull government guarantees. Refinancing in this manner: (1) Is contraryto the ongoing role and effectiveness of the FFB, an entity establishedto provide an efficient, least cost mechanism for financing a broad rangeof government programs; (2) interferes with the administration of Federalcredit policy; (3) competes with the Treasury financing of the nationaldebt; and (4) provides a further subsidy to borrowers. This subsidy wouldbe provided to borrowers that have already received the lowest availablerate at the time that they originally borrowed funds, and this subsidywould be provided outside of the normal budget/appropriations process,without the determination of the need of the borrower for the subsidy. Thus this determination by the Secretary prevents the U.S. taxpayer fromsuffering measurable dollar losses above and beyond those that will resultfrom the $2,000,000,000 of par prepayments mandated by the Congress duringFY 1988, as well as protecting the taxpayer from the unquantifiable coststhat result from the use of full government guarantees in the private creditmarkets.  Therefore, the revised regulations do not address payments in excess of$2.0 billion in FY 1988.  Section 1401 of OBRA also sets forth requirements for prioritizing prepaymentapplications. Priority will be given first to: (a) Those 8 borrowers thatwere determined by the Administrator of REA, prior to December 22, 1987,to be eligible to prepay, or prepaid an FFB loan pursuant to section 306(A);then to (b) other borrowers of loans made by the FFB and guaranteed byREA, on a first come_first served basis in the order in which borrowersare prepared to disburse funds to the FFB.  In order to both implement the provisions of section 1401 of OBRA and tomodify and clarify certain aspects of the existing regulations, 7 CFR Part1786 is being revised. The major revisions to the regulations summarizedas follows:  The eligibility criteria previously set forth in andSection;1786.5 have beendeleted. Procedures to prioritize prepayment applications and, if necessary,pro-rate applications have been established in a new andSection;1786.5. TheApplication Procedure, contained in andSection;1786.6, has been revised anda new subsection dealing with the submisson of applications has been added. As a result of the experience REA gained from previous prepayment transactions,the qualifications provisions relating to the Private Loan have been modifiedto permit more flexibility in developing a loan structure, provided thatthe term, conditions and structure of the Private Loan does not resultin an Increase in Loan Guarantee Risk as determined by REA. Additionally,the regulations have been revised to permit the prepayment of FFB advancesthat bear interest at rates below 10.0 percent.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1786  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Electric utilities, Telephony utilities,Guaranteed loan program_energy, Guaranteed loan program_telephone.
