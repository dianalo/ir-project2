Unless the market turn on Tuesday continues to gain momentum, officials said, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. could be hurt by less private money being available to buy failed institutions, meaning the insurance funds would have to shoulder more recapitalization costs. The funds also could find liquidating loans, real estate and other assets of failed banks and thrift institutions more costly, as values fall along with stock prices.    Should the market downturn prove to be temporary, the funds would have less to fear.    Meanwhile, the market's drop has halted a disasterous increase in interest rates that since April had caused billions of dollars of paper losses in the bond and mortgage-backed securities portfolios of banks and Sandamp;Ls.    The FDIC and FSLIC, which insure, respectively, bank and Sandamp;L deposits of as much as $100,000, have increasingly looked to private investors to help recapitalize failed institutions. Investors have done so, in part, on the belief that the strong stock market would allow them to turn around the institutions and then take them public or otherwise sell them at a profit.    One federal banking official said yesterday he was worried about the pending bailout of First City Bancorp. of Texas that hinges on an investment group raising $500 million of fresh capital. &quot;It's getting some discussion here,&quot; the official said. &quot;I'm glad we aren't closing today or tomorrow.&quot; The costly alternative would be a Continental Illinois Corp.-type bailout done solely with FDIC funds.    As previously reported, the investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. has agreed to raise the $500 million for First City. As of last week, the firm believed it had informal commitments from large investors for roughly that amount. Officials at the firm wouldn't comment yesterday on the offering, which was recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but hasn't become public. One person close to the money-raising effort said that as of midday yesterday, no investors had withdrawn their interest. &quot;It's almost impossible to predict,&quot; this person said. &quot;Who . . . knows what's going to happen?&quot;    A. Robert Abboud, however, the former Chicago banker who heads the group that has agreed to take over First City, said he sees no danger of the transaction falling apart. &quot;This deal's going to go,&quot; he said from First City's Houston headquarters. &quot;I'm finding it hard to see how . . . (the market's decline) affects us.&quot;    Bids for insolvent banks and savings and loans probably will decline as much as stock prices have -- 30% or more. &quot;The prices of private deals will mirror the (stock) prices of comparable public companies in the market,&quot; said Steve McLin, president of America First Financial Corp., a San Francisco concern that has raised about $120 million to bid for banks and Sandamp;Ls, including failed ones.    Such so-called vulture funds will now find it &quot;tough to raise money for deals,&quot; according to William Isaac, the former FDIC chairman who now represents investment groups bidding for banks and Sandamp;Ls.    Also, Mr. Isaac cautioned, &quot;if we go into a deep recession, you'd find the (bank) failure rate go up again.&quot; The FDIC expects about 200 banks to fail this year, but said recently that failures appeared to be peaking.    The FDIC currently has about $11 billion in assets under liquidation. In the midst of Monday's market plunge, according to Steven Seelig, an FDIC liquidation official, one bidder for the commercial finance unit of a recently failed bank withdrew his interest. Mr. Seelig said the market's decline could damp both the price investors are willing to pay for assets of failed banks and the FDIC's ability to quickly sell assets -- allowing the agency thus far to preserve its precious cash reserves.    FSLIC, which is itself insolvent, has more than 50 failed Sandamp;Ls it would like to sell. The recently authorized $10.8 billion recapitalization of the fund would give it money to recapitalize some of those institutions partially and to attract private funds to help in the recapitalizations. However, the big paper losses many Sandamp;Ls suffered from the interest-rate increases this year will make fixing these institutions more costly. And the stock market's decline could make investors less generous. &quot;The price is going to be a lot lower,&quot; said the head of one investment group. &quot;All bets are off.&quot;    James Barth, chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees FSLIC, said he thinks it is too early to say what the market's impact will be on efforts to sell off insolvent Sandamp;Ls. &quot;Right now, we've had a couple of days' news,&quot; he said. &quot;Acquisitions and mergers are long-term propositions.&quot;    The dip in interest rates this week, however, is a hopeful sign for thrifts and for FSLIC. Rates on fixed-rate home mortgages dropped nearly a full percentage point yesterday, as funds poured into government and agency securities. As a result, well-secured home mortgages, unlike other bank and thrift assets under liquidation, could become more valuable. &quot;The direct fallout on housing of Monday's meltdown in the stock market is negligible, as long as the thing doesn't spread to the bond market,&quot; said James W. Christian chief economist at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.    &quot;But if we saw the stock market just continue to go down, then you'd start to have effects on consumer confidence and probably as a consequence of that, you'd see some fall off in consumer spending, and all the numbers start to get worse then,&quot; Mr. Christian said.    The stampede into Treasury securities is likely to have some positive effects for homeowners who have adjustable-rate mortgages. Because the yields on Treasury securities have been dropping, so will the rates on the approximately 75% of existing adjustable-rate loans that are tied to Treasury rates.    If deposits continue to flood into thrift institutions, as they did at some institutions on Monday, then the thrifts' cost of funds also will drop. Such a drop would benefit homeowners who have adjustable-rate mortgages linked to the thrifts' cost-of-funds indexes. </TEXT></DOC>
