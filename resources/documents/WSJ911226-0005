A survey in Washington State found that the proportion ofbreast-cancer patients who are receiving surgery thatpreserves the breast is declining. The decline is occurringdespite recommendations that all women diagnosed in the earlystages of breast cancer be considered for treatment thatpreserves the breast.</LP><TEXT>   In the second study, a survey of hospitals in Illinoisfound indications that small urban hospitals are failing toproperly diagnose and treat breast cancer. In particular, thestudy reinforces evidence that lower-income people withoutadequate insurance coverage receive poorer care than thosewith private health insurance.   Both studies, published in this week's Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, suggest that while currenttreatment methods for breast cancer are far from ideal, eventhe limited advances of recent years aren't getting out topatients in a uniform manner.   Particularly surprising was the finding by researchers atSeattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and theUniversity of Washington. They found a percentage declinebetween 1985 and 1989 of breast-cancer patients undergoing asocalled lumpectomy, a procedure in which a surgeon excisesonly the tumor and some surrounding tissue instead ofperforming a mastectomy in which the entire breast isremoved.   This was true even though a major national study publishedin 1985 found that women with early forms of breast cancerdid equally well whether they were treated with a lumpectomyfollowed by radiation, or by the removal of the entirebreast. That study's results received much attention incancer treatment journals. Based on the study, a federalpanel concluded in 1990 that a combination of surgery andradiation that preserves the breast actually was preferablefor the majority of women with stage one and two of thedisease. Yet, according to the Seattle research, doctors andtheir patients are acting as if they are unaware of thisnews.   The researchers identified the percentage decline in theless radical procedure by surveying medical records of about8,000 women in western Washington state who, between 1983 and1989, were diagnosed with stage one or stage two breastcancer, early forms of the disease. The researchers foundthat in 1983 and 1984, about 36% of women diagnosed withstage one and 24.5% with stage two underwent a lumpectomy.   In 1985, when the study was released, the percentageundergoing the breast-preserving therapy jumped to 46% ofthose with stage one and 30% of those with stage two of thedisease. Surprisingly, however, the less severe proceduredeclined in use in the next few years, so that in 1988 and1989, only 43% of those with stage one and 24.4% of thosewith stage two underwent the breast-preserving procedure.   The researchers, led by DeAnn Lazovich and Roger E. Moe,said that 75% of the 170,000 American women each yeardiagnosed with cancer are eligible for less invasive therapy.They said the failure of most women to benefit from thistreatment strategy indicates a strong need for bettereducation among patients and their doctors, more vigilantmonitoring of care, easier access to medical centers withradiation therapy and policies requiring that insurers don'tend up promoting the more extensive surgery by making higherpayments to surgeons.   The second study, by researchers at the University ofIllinois in Chicago and Northwestern University School ofMedicine, found in a survey of 99 Illinois hospitals thatbreast-cancer patients at urban hospitals were more likely toreceive a diagnosis late in the disease, and were less likelyto receive radiation therapy, than patients treated at moreaffluent facilities. The survey of 5,766 patients in 1988,strongly suggested that the quality of care was tied to thekind of insurance benefits, as well as the geographiclocation, of the patients.</TEXT></DOC>
