It brings to eight the number of aircraft the insurgents claimto have destroyed at the Bagram base since April 21.   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said the latest attackoccurred Thursday, the 11th anniversary of the coup that broughtthe communists to power in Afghanistan. Guerrillas have beenfighting since then to topple the communists.   There was no independent confirmation of their claims.   Rebel sources reported heavy fighting north of Kabul in additionto the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, Paktia and Kandahar.   Al-Bunyan, a news service of fundamentalist guerrilla leaderAbdul Rasul Sayyaf, said guerrillas have killed 40 governmenttroops, destroyed four tanks and shot down one jet in Kandaharsince April 15.   Twenty-five guerrillas died and 32 were wounded during the sameperiod, Al-Bunyan said.   The guerrillas, who are based in Pakistan, have said Kandaharwill be their second major offensive. Their first offensive, on thecity of Jalalabad, is at a stalemate after several weeks offighting.   The Jalalabad assault began three weeks after the last Sovietforces left Afghanistan. The Red Army intervened militarily inDecember 1979 to help fight the guerrillas but agreed to pull outby Feb. 15 under a U.N.-moderated accord.   The Afghan News Agency said government forces at Jalalabad havebegun shifting their families to Kabul, 70 miles to the west, toescape the rebel onslaught.   The capture of Jalalabad would give the rebels a badly neededvictory in their struggle to establish an Islamic republic and acrucial urban foothold for an assault on Kabul.</TEXT></DOC>
