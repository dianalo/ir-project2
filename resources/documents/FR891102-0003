Section701.31 summarizes the prohibitions on discrimination in real estate lending.Section 701.31 was not in need of major revision. The Board's final amendmentssimplify and clarify the regulation by making several technical changesas proposed.

Only minor changes to the regulation were proposed.The NCUA last amended andSection; 701.31 on August 31, 1979 (<T3>See</T3> 44 FR 51191). Section 701.31 is designed to summarize in oneplace the prohibitions on discrimination in real estate lending activitiescontained in: (1) The Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.)and Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations issued thereunder;and (2) the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691) and the FederalReserve Board's Regulation B (12 CFR Part 202) issued thereunder. NCUAis not required by either the Fair Housing Act or the Equal Credit OpportunityAct to promulgate regulations. However, the Board believes it helpful toFederal credit unions to have the nondiscrimination regulation in place.Comments were due on August 21, 1989. Five comment letters were received.Two national credit union trade associations, one state credit union league,one Federal credit union, and one savings and loan interest group commented.All five commenters agreed with the proposed changes. In the interest of keeping this section simple to use and understand, theNCUA Board is making only minor technical changes and changes requiredby the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (``the Amendments Act'') asproposed. The substantive changes required by the Amendments Act expandprohibited housing practices to include handicap and familial status (havingchildren under the age of 18). These two classes have been added to paragraphs(b)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(2) and (e)(1). The NCUA's Equal Housing Lenderposter has also been revised to include these changes. (<T3>See</T3> paragraph (d)(3).) Lastly, current paragraph (e)(1) referencestwo Supreme Court cases concerning discrimination. The Board believes thecited cases do not clarify nondiscrimination requirements for Federal creditunions and, as proposed, has deleted the references. The rest of the regulationremains unchanged. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>This final rule makes no substantive changes to the current rule. Neithera Regulatory Flexibility Analysis nor Paperwork Reduction Act analysisare required. Executive Order 12612 This regulation explains the law and sets forth previously establishedguidelines for Federal credit unions; it adds no new obligations. AlthoughFederal statutes prohibiting discrimination (Fair Housing Act and EqualOpportunity Act) apply to state-chartered credit unions as well, this regulationdoes not apply to them. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701 </ITAG>Credit unions, Discrimination in real estate lending.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on October 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board. </ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA amends its regulation as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS </ITAG>1.

(b) <T3>Nondiscrimination in Lending. </T3>(1) A Federal credit union may notdeny a real estate-related loan, nor may it discriminate in setting orexercising its rights pursuant to the terms or conditions of such a loan,nor may it discourage an application for such a loan, on the basis of therace, color, national origin, religion, sex, handicap, or familial status(having children under the age of 18) of: (i) Any applicant or joint applicant; (ii) Any person associated, in connection with a real estate-related loanapplication, with an applicant or joint applicant; (iii) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof the dwelling for which a real estate-related loan is requested; (iv) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof other dwellings in the vicinity of the dwelling for which a real estate-relatedloan is requested. (2) With regard to a real estate-related loan, a Federal credit union maynot consider a lending criterion or exercise a lending policy which hasthe effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin,religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children under theage of 18). Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this provisionappear in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. (3) Consideration of any of the following factors in connection with areal estate-related loan is not necessary to a Federal credit union's business,generally has a discriminatory effect, and is therefore prohibited: (i) The age or location of the dwelling; (ii) Zip code of the applicant's current residence; (iii) Previous home ownership; (iv) The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the dwelling;(v) The income level of residents in the neighborhood of the dwelling.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this provision appearin paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (c) <T3>Nondiscrimination in appraisals. </T3>(1) A Federal credit union maynot rely upon an appraisal of a dwelling if it knows or should know thatthe appraisal is based upon consideration of the race, color, nationalorigin, religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children underthe age of 18) of: (i) Any applicant or joint applicant; (ii) Any person associated, in connection with a real estate-related loanapplication, with an applicant or joint applicant; (iii) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof the dwelling for which a real estate-related loan is requested; (iv) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof other dwellings in the vicinity of the dwelling for which a real estate-relatedloan is requested. (2) With respect to a real-estate related loan, a Federal credit unionmay not rely upon an appraisal of a dwelling if it knows or should knowthat the appraisal is based upon consideration of a criterion which hasthe effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin,religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children under theage of 18). Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this provisionappear in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. (3) A Federal credit union may not rely upon an appraisal that it knowsor should know is based upon consideration of any of the following criteria,for such criteria generally have a discriminatory effect, and are not necessaryto a Federal credit union's business: (i) The age or location of the dwelling; (ii) The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the dwelling;(iii) The income level of the residents in the neighborhood of the dwelling.(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is recognizedthat there may be factors concerning location of the dwelling which canbe properly considered in an appraisal. If any such factor(s) is reliedupon, it must be specifically documented in the appraisal, accompaniedby a brief statement demonstrating the necessity of using such factor(s).Guidelines concerning the consideration of location factors appear in paragraph(e)(3) of this section. (5) Each Federal credit union shall make available, to any requesting member/applicant,a copy of the appraisal used in connection with that member's real estate-relatedloan application. The appraisal shall be available for a period of 25 monthsafter the applicant has received notice from the Federal credit union ofthe action taken by the Federal credit union on the real estate-relatedloan application.

Posters containing this notice and logotype maybe obtained from the Regional Offices of the National Credit Union Administration.(3) <T3>Logotype and notice of nondiscrimination compliance.</T3> The logotypeand text of the notice required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shallbe as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 0 012 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-C   </ITAG>(e) <T3>Guidelines.</T3> (1) Compliance with the Fair Housing Act is achievedwhen each loan applicant's creditworthiness is evaluated on an individualbasis, without presuming that the applicant has certain characteristicsof a group. If certain lending policies or procedures do presume groupcharacteristics, they may violate the Fair Housing Act, even though thecharacteristics are not based upon race, color, sex, national origin, religion,handicap, or familial status. Such a violation occurs when otherwise faciallynondiscriminatory lending procedures (either general lending policies orspecific criteria used in reviewing loan applications) have the effectof making real estate-related loans unavailable or less available on thebasis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, handicap, or familialstatus. Note, however, that a policy or criterion which has a discriminatoryeffect is not a violation of the Fair Housing Act if its use achieves alegitimate business necessity which cannot be achieved by using less discriminatorystandards. It is also important to note that the Equal Credit OpportunityAct and Regulation B prohibit discrimination, either per se or in effect,on the basis of the applicant's age, marital status, receipt of publicassistance, or the exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit ProtectionAct. (2) Paragraph (b)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of certainfactors because of their likely discriminatory effect and because theyare not necessary to make sound real estate-related loans. For purposesof clarification, the prohibited use of location factors in this sectionis intended to prevent abandonment of areas in which a Federal credit union'smembers live or want to live. It is not intended to require loans in thoseareas that are geographically remote from the FCU's main or branch officesor that contravene the parameters of a Federal credit union's charter.Further, this prohibition does not preclude requiring a borrower to obtainflood insurance protection pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Actand Part 760 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, nor does it preclude involvementwith Federal or state housing insurance programs which provide for lowerinterest rates for the purchase of homes in certain urban or rural areas.Also, the legitimate use of location factors in an appraisal does not constitutea violation of the provision of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, whichprohibits consideration of location of the dwelling. Finally, the prohibiteduse of prior home ownership does not preclude a Federal credit union fromconsidering an applicant's payment history on a loan which was made toobtain a home. Such action entails consideration of the payment recordon a previous loan in determining creditworthiness; it does not entailconsideration of prior home ownership. (3)(i) Paragraph (c)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of theage or location of a dwelling in a real estate-related loan appraisal.These restrictions are intended to prohibit the use of unfounded or unsubstantiatedassumptions regarding the effect upon loan risk of the age of a dwellingor the physical or economic characteristics of an area. Appraisals shouldbe based on the present market value of the property offered as security(including consideration of specific improvements to be made by the borrower)and the likelihood that the property will retain an adequate value overthe term of the loan. (ii) The term ``age of the dwelling'' does not encompass structural soundness.In addition, the age of the dwelling may be used by an appraiser as a basisfor conducting further inspections of certain structural aspects of thedwelling. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section does, however, prohibit an unsubstantiateddetermination that a house over X years in age is not structurally sound.(iii) With respect to location factors, paragraph (c)(4) of this sectionrecognizes that there may be location factors which may be considered inan appraisal, and requires that the use of any such factors be specificallydocumented in the appraisal. These factors will most often be those locationfactors which may negatively affect the short range future value (up to3-5 years) of a property. Factors which in some cases may cause the marketvalue of a property to decline are recent zoning changes or a significantnumber of abandoned homes in the immediate vicinity of the property. However,not all zoning changes will cause a decline in property values, and proximityto abandoned buildings may not affect the market value of a property becausethe cause of abandonment is unrelated to high risk. Proper considerationsinclude the condition and utility of the improvement and various physicalfactors such as street conditions, amenities such as parks and recreationareas, availability of public utilities and municipal services, and exposureto flooding and land faults.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-25035 Filed 11-1-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
