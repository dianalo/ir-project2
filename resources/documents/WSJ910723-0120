Keating Jr. to admit that hecommitted thrift-related crime.   Robin S. Symes, 38 years old, of Cincinnati, Ohio, pleadedguilty to a federal information that accused him ofparticipating in a scheme to mislead buyers of bonds inLincoln's former parent company, American Continental Corp.,based in Phoenix, Ariz. The scheme involved portraying thebonds as reliable to prospective purchasers, even though thecompany had told institutional investors that its financeswere troubled.</LP><TEXT>   Rudolph E. Loewenstein, a lawyer for Mr. Symes, couldn'timmediately be reached for comment.   The former Lincoln official is widely expected tocooperate with federal prosecutors in their investigation ofthe thrift and American Contintental. His plea to statecriminal charges also means that he will testify against Mr.Keating and a co-defendant, former American Continentalpresident Judy Wischer, in a state securities fraud trialscheduled to begin on Aug. 2.   Another former Lincoln president, Raymond Fidel, pleadedguilty to similar state and federal crimes last March. Alsothat month, former American Continental lawyer Mark Sauteradmitted to federal conspiracy and fraud charges. LastOctober, Arizona real estate developer Ernest C. Garciapleaded guilty to federal bank fraud charges in connectionwith Lincoln.   The series of guilty pleas seem to indicate that federalprosecutors are coming closer to bringing criminal chargesagainst Mr. Keating, the former chairman of AmericanContinental. A multi-agency task force has been investigatinghis activities for two years, in the wake of the federalgovernment's seizure of Lincoln.   American Continental has filed for protection fromcreditors under federal bankruptcy laws. The bailout of thethrift, seized in April, 1989, is expected to cost $2.6billion.</TEXT></DOC>
