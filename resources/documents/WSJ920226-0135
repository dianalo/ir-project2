Now comes the painful part: Calculating taxes.   Even seemingly routine transactions can often producethrobbing headaches as the tax-filing deadline draws near.&quot;This is a fairly complicated area even for experts,&quot; warnsPeter K. Scott, director for Internal Revenue Servicepolicies and practice at Coopers andamp; Lybrand.   For many people, the knottiest problem is how to calculatecapital gains and losses on fund shares they sold. Evenmeticulous record keepers who carefully save all their fundstatements often explode in frustration when trying to figureout which of the various methods is best to use.   &quot;It's a very difficult problem for the average investor,particularly when you have automatically reinvesteddividends,&quot; says A. Keith Brodkin, chairman and president ofMassachusetts Financial Services in Boston. Instead ofreceiving their dividends in cash, investors often tell theirfunds to reinvest those dividends in additional fund shares.   Here is a summary of the basic rules on mutual-funds andtaxes, and tips on how to avoid some common pitfalls.                                                                                                          What's Taxable. By now, shareholders should have receivedforms from their mutual funds with details of how much theyreceived in distributions last year. Look for Form 1099-DIVor a substitute.   Typically, holders receive money from their mutual fundsin the form of dividends and capital-gains distributions. Youhave to report any distributions as income even if you toldthe fund to reinvest the money automatically in additionalfund shares. Contrary to what may seem logical, the IRS saysdividends declared and made payable last October, November orDecember but not actually paid until January of this year arefully taxable for 1991.   Mutual fund investors also have to report any capitalgains or losses on fund shares they sold last year. Remember,you may incur a capital gain or loss every time you transfermoney from one fund to another, either by telephone or bywriting a check. Also keep in mind that the rules on capitalgains apply even with mutual funds that invest only intax-free municipal bonds.                                                                                                          How to Report. In general, if you didn't sell mutual fundshares last year, all you have to do is enter the informationfrom your funds on your tax return.   Ordinary dividends included on Form 1099-DIV are reportedon Form 1040, line 9. If the total of gross dividends andother distributions exceeded $400, report it on Schedule B.Ordinary dividends include not only dividends from stockfunds but also from taxable bond and money-market funds.   Exempt-interest dividends, such as those paid by tax-freemoney funds, aren't included on Form 1099-DIV but arereported to shareholders separately. Shareholders have toreport these dividends, along with any other tax-exemptinterest, on Form 1040, line 8b, even though they don't paytax on the money.   Capital-gains distributions reported on Form 1099-DIV aretreated as long-term capital gains regardless of how long theshareholder has owned the fund. Taxpayers who don't have anyother capital-gains transactions that require them to fillout Schedule D can enter such distributions directly on Form1040, line 14. If gross dividends and other distributions,including capital-gains distributions, exceed $400, reportthem on Schedule B. The IRS says upper-income taxpayers willfind it saves them money to report capital gainsdistributions on Schedule D and use Part IV of that scheduleto figure the tax. See IRS Publication 564 for more details.   Special rules apply for taxpayers who received a capitalgain distribution on fund shares held for six months or lessand sold at a loss. There also are special rules fortaxpayers who received exempt-interest dividends on fundshares held for six months or less and sold at a loss. Again,see IRS Publication 564 for details.                                                                                                          If You Sold Shares. Gains and losses realized when sellingmutual-fund shares have to be reported on Schedule D. This isby far the most complicated task for fund investors -- andthe area where it is easiest to make the most costly errors.   For investors who bought all of their fund shares on thesame date and at the same price, there should be no problem.But those who made additional investments along the way, orparticipated in an automatic reinvestment plan, have to takeinto account each full or fractional share received.   Many taxpayers wind up paying too much tax because theyforget the extra shares bought with reinvested dividends.Suppose, for example, you invested $1,000 in a fund manyyears ago and received another $800 in distributions thatwere plowed back into additional shares. Then you sold yourentire stake late last year for $2,000. What is your gain?   Some taxpayers mistakenly subtract their $1,000 originalpurchase from the $2,000 they received upon selling theirshares, leaving a $1,000 gain. Wrong. The correct answer isonly $200. Subtract $1,800 (the $1,000 original investmentplus $800 in reinvested dividends) from $2,000. It's &quot;veryimportant to keep track&quot; of all reinvested dividends andretain records, says Tricia K. Bonner, partner at the lawfirm of Thacher Proffitt andamp; Wood. If you haven't, ask the fundto send you the necessary records.                                                                                                          Foreign Taxes. This issue affects investors in mutualfunds that invest in international stocks, bonds and othersecurities. Mutual funds are supposed to notify shareholdersif they are entitled to claim a tax credit or deduction fortaxes that the fund paid to a foreign country or a U.S.possession.   Sidney Kess, a New York lawyer and accountant, says it isusually wise for taxpayers to take a tax credit, rather thana deduction. That is because a credit directly reduces yourtax bill on a dollar-for-dollar basis. But to do that, youmust fill out the IRS's user-unfriendly Form 1116, &quot;ForeignTax Credit.&quot;                                                                                                          Fees and Other Charges. Mutual-fund shareholders can'tdeduct any of the commissions, fees and other charges theypaid to buy shares. But they can usually add these fees andcharges to the cost of their shares.                                                                                                          Additional Information. The IRS has several freepublications that provide useful information for mutual-fundinvestors. These include Publication 17, &quot;Your Federal IncomeTax For Individuals&quot;; Publication 564, &quot;Mutual FundDistributions&quot;; Publication 590, &quot;Individual RetirementArrangements&quot;; Publication 550, &quot;Investment Income andExpenses&quot;; and Publication 514, &quot;Foreign Tax Credit forIndividuals.&quot;   Vanguard Group's 1991 Tax Guide, a 110-page paperback thatoffers helpful advice and handy worksheets, is available for$5 from The Vanguard Group; Attn.: Tax Guide; P.O.

There areessentially three basic approaches.   For many people, the best choice will be the &quot;specificidentification&quot; method, in which you specify exactly whichshares you sold. If you made a profit, you can minimize yourtax bill if you are able to show that you sold the sharesthat cost you the most. The IRS can be tough: You should beable to show that you told your broker or your fund theparticular shares to be sold at the time of the sale. The IRSalso says you should be able to show you received a writtenconfirmation of which shares were sold, though many fundsdon't do this.   If you can't identify which shares you sold, the IRS saysto assume that you sold those shares you acquired first. Thebig disadvantage of this &quot;first-in, first-out&quot; approach isthat the shares you bought first usually have the lowestcost, so selling them results in the highest tax. On theother hand, if the value of your fund plunged, this may bethe best approach because it would give you the biggestcapital loss.   An alternative for some fund investors is the&quot;average-cost,&quot; or &quot;average-basis&quot; method, which requirescalculating the average per-share price for all your sharesof the fund. Once you've used this method, you must continueto use it when you calculate gains and losses for that samefund in the future.                                                                                                                         THREE BASIC APPROACHES                                                                                                          Suppose you bought 1,000 shares of a mutual fund at $10each in January 1990. Then, through automatic reinvestment ofdividends, you received another 50 shares that July valued at$10 a share; 50 more shares in December, valued at $11 ashare; 50 shares in July also valued at $11 a share; and 50shares in December 1991 valued at $12 a share. Then you sold100 shares late last December at $12 a share, or a total of$1,200.                                                                                                          SPECIFIC-IDENTIFICATION                                                                                                          Sale proceeds:                              $1,200   Minus highest-cost shares:                  $1,150   (Based on 50 shares at $11 in July 1991   and 50 shares at $12 in December 1991)   Short-Term* Gain:                              $50                                                                                                          *The shares sold were held for less than one year.                                                                                                          AVERAGE-COST                                                                                                          Sale proceeds:                              $1,200   Minus average cost:                         $1,017   (Divide total purchase price   of $12,200 by 1,200 shares. That equals   $10.17 a share. Multiply by 100 shares.)   Long-Term Gain:                               $183                                                                                                                                                                                                                 FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT                                                                                                          Sale proceeds:                              $1,200   Minus cost of first 100 shares acquired:    $1,000   (Shares you bought in January 1990   at $10 a share.)   Long-Term Gain:                               $200                                                                                                       </TEXT></DOC>
