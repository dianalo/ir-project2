Chief Prosecutor Christoph Schaefer told reporters at a newsconference in Frankfurt that the names were obtained from the U.N.by West German officials who track suspected Nazi war criminals.   Schaefer said the U.N. records, which were not made avaiable fornearly 40 years to West German officials, contained names of peoplewho were not investigated previously by the West German government.   Jochen Schroers, a spokesman for Schaefer, said authorities firstwill determine ``among other things, how many of the people beinginvestigated are still alive.''   ``As you know, most of them are quite old by now, and many haveprobably died,'' Schroers said.   ``Until the investigations are complete and it is determinedthere is cause to file charges, I cannot release any of the names,''he said.   Schroers said the list included no prominent names.   He said he did not know when the investigations would becompleted.</TEXT></DOC>
