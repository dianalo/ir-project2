In addition, the department revised retail sales figuresupward for both December and November. It initially estimatedthat sales fell 0.4% in December and 0.5% in November, but itnow says sales gained 0.1% in December and were unchanged inNovember.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts said it is still too early to talk about asustained recovery in consumer demand, but they wereencouraged that, considering the revisions, spending hasmoved modestly upward since October. The January increase wasthe largest sales gain since last May.   &quot;These new figures suggest that consumer spending hasstabilized,&quot; said Norman Robertson, chief economist at MellonBank in Pittsburgh. &quot;But to generate a sustained recovery inretail sales, we have to have a significant recovery in thelabor market, which hasn't materialized yet.&quot;   Such a recovery could be on the horizon. Initial claimsfor jobless benefits fell a seasonally adjusted 13,000 in theweek ended Feb. 1, the Labor Department said. That was betterthan expected, although economists said it was too early totell whether the decline will be sustained.   In January, Americans on average worked shorter weeks andmade less per hour, indicating consumer spending may remain abit sluggish. Moreover, Federal Reserve Board Governor SusanPhillips said continuing low consumer confidence has thecentral bank so baffled that one of its seven governors hassuggested bringing in psychologists to advise it on how toimprove the nation's economic mood.   Speaking to a group of bankers here yesterday, Ms.Phillips said she believes improvements in the economy won'tbe long in coming, though. &quot;While growth may remain sluggishin the near term, the groundwork is being laid&quot; for a healthyeconomy, she suggested.   The sales figures by themselves aren't likely to affectany decision by the Fed about whether to ease interest ratesagain. The Fed has said it will wait to review a variety ofother January economic indicators -- including figures onindustrial production, capacity utilization and producerprices, all of which are due out today -- before decidingwhether to ease monetary policy further to help stimulate theeconomy.   The chief areas of sales strength in January were buildingmaterials and department stores, whose sales increased 5.4%and 2.1%, respectively. Auto, restaurant, grocery store andgas station sales also picked up during the month. Furniture,drugstore and specialty apparel store sales declined.   January's retail sales were a strong 3.9% above theirlevel of a year earlier, and restaurant sales were up nearly9%. That's not a surprising gain, considering that as thecountry became involved in the Persian Gulf War a year ago,Americans were glued to their television sets and consumerspending fell sharply.   Some retailers were encouraged by the numbers and by theirown sales volume in January but were hesitant to declare therecession over.   Furniture merchant Ikea, whose headquarters are in Sweden,said its business picked up considerably duringpost-Christmas sales in January. It also said traffic&quot;steadily progressed&quot; in November and December. &quot;But we don'tsee any sign that the economy is getting better,&quot; said Ikeaspokeswoman Pam Diaconis. &quot;We can't say things are reallychanging.&quot;   Timothy Finley, chairman of Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, basedin Hampstead, Md., said, &quot;Nothing has happened to make methink the economy has turned the corner.&quot; Sales at theclothing chain have &quot;been all over the place,&quot; with noconsistent pattern of growth, he said.   Clark Johnson, chairman of Pier 1 Imports Inc., FortWorth, Texas, is more optimistic. Pier 1, he said, has had an&quot;appreciable increase&quot; in sales in New England, a regionwhere the home furnishings retailer has been underconsiderable pressure the past two years. A year and a halfago, Pier 1 put some expansion plans on hold because theMideast crisis touched off by Iraq's occupation of Kuwait hadput a big damper on business. Now, Mr. Johnson said, Pier 1may boost its employment by 4% in the next few months becauseof increased business.   &quot;There is a better tone in the retail market,&quot; Mr. Johnsonsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
