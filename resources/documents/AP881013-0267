(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Today is seven hundredths of a secondlonger than a day in the year 1876 B.C., say scientists who studiedancient Chinese records of solar eclipses to learn how much Earth'srotation is slowing.   Just as a spinning ice skater slows down by extending her arms,Earth's rotation on its axis slows as tidal interactions make themoon orbit Earth more quickly and become more distant from theplanet, astronomer Kevin Pang, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,said Wednesday.   ``Four billion years ago, the moon was only one-third as faraway as it is now, and the day was only eight hours long at thetime,'' said Pang, whose study will be published soon in theBritish journal Vistas in Astronomy.   Pang and his co-authors determined that, compared to today, thelength of a day was 22 thousandths of second shorter in A.D. 532,42 thousandths of a second shorter in 899 B.C., and 70 thousandthsof a second shorter in 1876 B.C.</TEXT></DOC>
