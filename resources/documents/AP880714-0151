(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Billionaire John Kluge is known as ashrewd dealmaker.   Here's an example:   The 73-year-old owner of Metromedia Inc. could get $4 million byselling his waterfront house in Westchester County. But, bydividing the lot in two, he can get an additional $500,000.   On Tuesday night, the local zoning board unanimously approved avariance that will allow Kluge to divide the lot.   In 1972, Kluge paid $350,000 for an 18-room house located on alittle more than an acre. He later bought property next door,slightly less than an acre, for $2 million and razed an 11-roomhouse so he could add on to his home.   Kluge changed his mind about the addition, however, and decidedto sell.   Kluge could sell the entire property as one lot for about $4million, according to an appraisal submitted to the zoning board.But by selling two lots, Kluge should get at least an additional$500,000, the appraisal said.   Kluge, who is worth $3 billion, is the second-richest American,trailing Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart retailing chain,according to Forbes magazine.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   William Christopher, who played the chaplainon the television series ``M-A-S-H,'' and his wife, Barbara, saidthey sensed something was wrong with their son the first night hewas home.
