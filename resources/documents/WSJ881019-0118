MCI said profit rose to $99 million, or 38 cents a share, from $17 million, or six cents a share, the year before. Revenue grew to $1.36 billion from $994 million, with strong contributions from 800 service and international service.    Bert Roberts, president of the long-distance telephone company, said that sales exceeded the company's expectations &quot;in virtually every market segment&quot; and that traffic remained robust even through the summer, when volume normally slows. In recent months, MCI has aggressively advertised its 800 service and its international service and has beefed up its sales force for big corporate accounts.    Daniel Akerson, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said MCI's growth is being fueled by the trend among corporate customers to split their long-distance work among two or three carriers. &quot;Large and sophisticated customers are looking at both MCI and ATandamp;T,&quot; he said. &quot;By and large, they want to keep a competitive arrangement&quot; to hold down costs, he added.    Meanwhile, MCI has been careful to hold its expenses in check -- a task that isn't always easy during a period of explosive growth, Mr. Akerson said. &quot;We have some heated discussions around here on where to spend money,&quot; he said.    Mr. Akerson said MCI achieved positive cash flow during the quarter -- a quarter ahead of schedule -- and expects to remain cash positive in the future.    MCI shares closed yesterday at $22.125, up $1.125, in national over-the-counter trading.    Analysts said MCI's continued vigorous growth and a strong push by its smaller rival U.S. Sprint eventually will hurt American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which is expected to announce earnings later this week. &quot;Sooner or later, it has to show up in ATandamp;T's numbers,&quot; said Joel Gross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.    At this point, even such hotly contested regulatory initiatives as ATandamp;T's Tariff 15, which cuts prices for a big customer, Holiday Corp., or a shift to capping ATandamp;T prices rather than profits probably wouldn't hurt MCI's momentum, said Frank Governali, an analyst with First Boston Corp. &quot;MCI is winning customers not on price but on good customer service,&quot; he said.    The results for the latest quarter included a pretax gain of $11 million from antitrust settlements and a charge of $8 million on a contract settlement. A year ago, net income included pretax gains of $2 million and $9 million from antitrust settlements. The latest quarter's results also reflect accrual of $5 million for dividends on preferred shares issued to International Business Machines Corp. in August. </TEXT></DOC>
