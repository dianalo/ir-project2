Turner is calling its program CNN Newsroom and it will be carriedweekdays at 3:45 a.m. EDT on Cable News Network.   The pre-dawn telecast is designed to enable teachers to tape theprogram and review it to see if all or part could be used in classlater that day.   The program was launched well before the new school year beginsto give teachers and administrators a chance to determine if it fitswith their lesson plans. Turner also gets a jump of several monthson Whittle's ad-supported Channel One news program that beginsnationally in March.   With the notable exception of commercials, the first 15-minuteedition of CNN Newsroom resembled the 12-minute Channel One programsthat Whittle Communications tested over a seven-week period in sixschools last spring.   Both programs are anchored by a youthful and demographicallybalanced team. The CNN Newsroom anchors are Cassandra Henderson andBrian Todd, Turner Broadcasting employees selected from a group ofmore than 250 applicants.   The programs open with news headlines, contain filmed newsfootage, make liberal use of maps and carry several feature storieschosen and developed to appeal to teenagers.   CNN Newsroom had an expanded feature on the career of Rep. MickeyLeland, the Texas Democrat who was killed in an airplane crash inEthiopia.   It also had a feature on a Georgia high school teacher who giveshis students practical experience in using the English language byhaving them research, write and edit stories for a folklore magazinehe publishes.   And it had a feature on Chinese students who have found they mustsit through lessons taught by the army in the aftermath of thebloody suppression of a student uprising this summer in Beijing.   During its test run earlier this year, Channel One had featureson the life of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and seriesthat dealt with the environment and life in Russia for teenagers.   The services are delivered differently.   CNN Newsroom arrives by cable or is taped off television at home,while Channel One is delivered by satellite.   Atlanta-based Turner said it has endorsements or pledges ofsupport from cable operators representing nearly 50 percent of thecable television hosueholds in the United States to deliver theprogram to schools.   Turner is paying the entire bill for producing the show andproviding a teacher's guide by electronic mail to help in using theprogram in class.   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., is providing both the programand delivery by using advertising revenue.   Whittle said only a fraction of the nation's classrooms areindividually equipped with TV sets and that without them, teachersare unable to make the best use possible of the daily news serviceand other television programs.   Channel One schools get an average of $50,000 in video hardware,including TV sets, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes inexchange for allowing Whittle to sell two minutes of commercials ineach 12-minute news program to advertisers. During the test,companies pitched candy bars, deodorant and jeans to thetough-to-reach teen audience.   Several national education groups have blasted Whittle for takingunfair advantage of students who are required to be in school andmay find it difficult to avoid the commercials.   New York education officials have prohibited public schools inthat state from subscribing to Channel One and the top educationalofficer in California has said any school in his state that takes itrisks losing state aid.   Nonetheless, Whittle hopes to sign up 8,000 schools for ChannelOne by the start of the 1990-91 school year. Turner expects teachersin about 1,000 schools will use CNN Newsroom when school starts inthe next few weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
