(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL continued giving Jim Bakker fatbonuses even while it was losing money, the ministry's formerfinance director testified today.   ``We're spending as if there's no crisis,'' Peter Bailey, theformer finance director, said in a 1984 memo to Bakker and PTLexecutive vice president Richard Dortch, who was indicted withBakker and pleaded guilty.   In November 1983, Bailey testified, he told Bakker thatcontributions for that month totaled $4.7 million while expenditureswere $6.8 million. Two weeks later, prosecutor Deborah Smith said,the board voted a $150,000 bonus for Jim and Tammy Bakker.   Bailey, testifying at Bakker's fraud trial, said he wrote in aMarch 1984 memo that ``every day brings us into a deeper crisis''and that more than $700,000 was needed to meet the payroll. Lessthan two weeks later, records showed that Bakker got a $390,000bonus.   On Tuesday, a coal miner's wife who gave $1,000 of her husband'sblack-lung benefits for lodging at PTL said she was told there wasno room at the inn where Bakker luxuriated in a suite withgold-plated swan bathroom fixtures.   ``I expected this to get a vacation every year ... for the restof our lives. That was what was sold to us,'' Sarah Combs, who has13 children and whose family lives on $400 a month, testified atBakker's fraud trial.   Also Tuesday, two former Bakker advisers testified they warnedthe PTL founder he was risking legal troubles by taking too muchmoney from the ministry. High salaries taken by Bakker and hisrelatives threatened PTL's tax-exempt status, the former attorneyand former accountant said.   The attorney, John Yorke, said he sent a memo to his law firmboss citing concerns about 1983 wages earned by Bakker and his wife,Tammy.   ``Together, Jim and Tammy have a monthly income of more than$30,000,'' he wrote. ``Jim has already received one bonus this yeartotaling $390,000. He could possibly earn more than $1 million thisyear.''   Guy Forcucci, a certified public accountant who worked for PTL inthe early 1980s and prepared Bakker's tax returns, testified he hadwarned Bakker as early as 1982 about his high salary.   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million for hispersonal benefit from PTL, which kept its tax-exempt status as areligious organization until 1988, almost a year after Bakker quitin a sex and money scandal.   Prosecutors say Bakker used his TV show to sell fraudulent $1,000``lifetime partnerships'' promising free lodging for a lifetime thatPTL could not provide.   Asked about Bakker's decision to issue tens of thousands morepartnerships than the 25,000 he first announced, Yorke said hebelieves PTL was legally obliged ``to go back to the original 25,000and tell them they had changed the terms and give them anopportunity to get their money back.''   Bakker made no such disclosure or offer, according to previoustestimony in the federal court trial.   ``Jim didn't like to hear bad news,'' Yorke testified. ``Onseveral occasions when Eddie got stern with him, he turned aroundand wouldn't look at him.''   Prosecutor Jerry Miller asked how long Bakker would refuse tolook at Knox, Yorke said, ``Until he left.'' PTL hired new attorneysin 1986.   Combs, of Spanishburg, W.Va., testified that she and her husband,who has black lung disease, bought their partnership in 1984 fromher husband's $19,000 disability fund but were unable to get hotelreservations at Heritage USA.   ``Every time I called I got somebody different, and they'd giveus a different reason why we couldn't get a reservation,'' she said.   A glum Bakker listened and scribbled notes as the jury watched avideotape of a 1986 TV pitch he made describing a lifetimepartnership offer as ``magnificent,'' ``wonderful'' and``spectacular.''   Also testifying was interior decorator James Taggart, who wassentenced to 17 years in prison and fined $500,000 last week for taxevasion while at PTL.   Taggart described a videotape showing the 4,000-square-foot suiteoften used by Bakker and his family in the Heritage Grand Hotel atthe PTL ministry's Heritage USA theme park near Fort Mill, S.C.   The decorator described gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures,antique beds and mirrored walls in the bedroom. He said the suiteincluded a 10-by-60-foot closet for Mrs. Bakker.   If convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakkercould be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5million.</TEXT></DOC>
