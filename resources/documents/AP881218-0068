Mariotte pointed to campaign statements by Bush and his choice ofNew Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, an ardent supporter of nuclearpower, to serve as White House chief of staff.   ``With John Sununu in the White House, the nuclear industry hasits most powerful close friend ever,'' Mariotte said. ``It never hada president or someone who ranks as high as Sununu does who is soideologically compatible with the industry.''   Sununu has repeatedly locked horns with Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis over the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant.Dukakis refused to submit evacuation plans for Massachusetts townslocated within 10 miles of the stalled New Hampshire plant, whichSununu supports.   During the campaign, Bush issued a policy statement saying that``clearly our overriding concern on nuclear power issues must be toprotect the safety of the public. If nuclear power plants do notreach the highest safety standards, they should not be licensed.   ``But if they do meet these standards, I strongly believe we musthave nuclear power. We must protect ourselves from dependance onforeign oil. We must diversify our energy sources, and safe nuclearpower can help improve our energy security.''   The Republican Party platform also called for expansion ofnuclear power provided environmental and safety standards were met.   Bush also will have to deal with safety and environmentalproblems plaguing the Energy Department's nuclear weapons productionand research complex.   During his second debate with Dukakis, the Democraticpresidential candidate, Bush said the department's Savannah RiverPlant in South Carolina ``needs to be made more safe. Will he(Dukakis) join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the ... nuclear materialrequirements for our Defense Department?''   Much will depend on whom Bush names as his secretary of energy.Among the names repeatedly mentioned are Peter Johnson, former headof Oregon's Bonneville Power Administration, and former Rep. HensonMoore, R-La.   Craig Fuller, co-chairman of Bush's transition team, said in aninterview last week that the Bush forces are focusing the search onsomeone who has the expertise to handle the nuclear waste question.   Jacob Sherr, an attorney with the New York-based NaturalResources Defense Council, said: ``I have seen no evidence so farthat Bush is really going to roll up his sleeves and that(administration officials) are going to commit themselves todoubling or tripling the DOE's nuclear weapons budget to really getserious about cleaning up the mess.''   Bush is expected to retain Lando W. Zech Jr. as chairman of theNuclear Regulatory Commission until Zech's term expires in June. Hethen will have the opportunity to name a new commissioner and selectthe panel's next chairman.   ``My guess is that Bush will appoint somebody who's much in theZech mold _ somebody who's going to continue the efforts Zech hasstarted to set the stage, as far as the government is able, toenable a nuclear resurgence,'' Mariotte said.   Harold Finger, president of the U.S. Council for EnergyAwareness, a Washington-based nuclear industry group, said he hopedBush would demonstrate ``federal leadership'' in helping persuadestate regulators to lift some economic disincentives that havediscouraged utilities from investing in new nuclear power plants.   Edward M. Davis, president of the American Nuclear EnergyCouncil, the nuclear industry's chief lobbying arm, predicted thenew administration will find Congress supportive of measures tofurther the development of nuclear power.   Legislation expected to be introduced in the new Congress dealswith such issues as federal support for development of advancedreactor designs, reforming NRC licensing procedures and reorganizingthe five-member NRC as an agency headed by a single administrator.   The industry's rosy outlook for nuclear power, however, isdisputed by another Washington-based anti-nuclear group, the SafeEnergy Communication Council.   The council said a September national opinion poll itcommissioned found that 59 percent of those responding opposedfurther nuclear power development, 36 percent favored building morenuclear reactors and 5 percent didn't know. The poll had a 3 percentmargin of error.   ``In proposing to build new nuclear power plants, George Bush andother nuclear power cheerleaders are way out of touch with MainStreet, U.S.A.,'' said Scott Denman, the group's director.</TEXT></DOC>
