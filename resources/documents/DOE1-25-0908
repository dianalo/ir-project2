And thestudy is aimed at an improvement of efficiency and cost reduction ofan amorphous solar electric cell by decreasing resistance, increasingtransparency and texturalization, and increasing resistivity againstplasma while making mass-production feasible. On the membrane formation,by using a normal pressure CVD unit, a current conducting glass of stannicoxide was produced to study for the decrease of resistance, increaseof transparency and texturalization, and an optimum CVD condition wasexplored. After abrasion, a current conducting membrane of a good qualitywith a membrane thickness 5,600 A, sheet resistance 5.2{Omega}/sq. cm,specific resistance 3.2 X 10{sup -4} {Omega}/cm, was obtained. It wasfound that in case when the stannic oxide only was formed on the glassbase plate, and in case when a reflection prevention treatment was performad,within a region of 6,000 - 7,000 A, by means of the reflection preventiontreatment, the transparency goes up reaching 83 - 84%. On the explorationof an optimum texture, it was found that by an abrasion process it isdifficult to increase the ratio of the particle hight and particle diameter,and the abrasion cost will be too high, and on the plasma resistivity,the resistivity of stannic oxide was studied, and it was found that incase a-Si membrane is piled in layers, the deterioration by plasma ismarkedly alleviated.
