The decision by Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun, just hours afterhis inauguration yesterday, came after the private insurer,the Rhode Island Share andamp; Deposit Indemnity Corp., asked thestate to place it into conservatorship. Banks in Rhode Islandwith other deposit insurance aren't affected.</LP><TEXT>   Rhode Island Share andamp; Deposit, one of the few remainingprivate insurers in the nation, was drained of much of itsreserves after the failure of closely held Heritage Loan andamp;Investment Co. Heritage failed after its presidentdisappeared and millions of dollars were discovered missing.   The other 45 banks and credit unions, which have a totalof $1.7 billion on deposit in some 300,000 accounts, won'treopen until they obtain federal deposit insurance, Gov.Sundlun said. The governor closed the institutions because,by law, they can't operate without deposit insurance.   Most of the institutions have applied for depositinsurance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or theNational Credit Union Administration, but their applicationshaven't yet been approved. Sheldon Whitehouse, the governor'slegal counsel, said state officials have asked that theprocess be expedited. Some could receive federal depositinsurance and reopen by Monday, Mr. Whitehouse said. &quot;Somewill take longer, {but} I don't know how long the outsidepotential is,&quot; he added.   It's unclear whether all of the 45 banks and credit unionscan meet the more stringent requirements, such as capitalrequirements, needed to get federal deposit insurance, hesaid. Those that don't will have to find a way to meet therequirements or close, he said.   Asked if any state money would be needed for a bailoutbecause of the private insurer's problems, Mr. Whitehousesaid, &quot;That's obviously the $64 question.&quot; He said the stateisn't certain of the financial health of all of theinstitutions insured by Rhode Island Share andamp; Deposit.   &quot;The primary emphasis is to protect the depositors inthese institutions,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to a get a firm ideaon whether there is a financial problem and how big it is . .. It is possible that what is left in {Rhode Island Share andamp;Deposit} won't cover potential losses in other institutions,but we don't know whether there will be losses or how big thelosses might be.&quot;   Officials of Rhode Island Share andamp; Deposit have estimatedthat the failure of Heritage -- which had about $25 millionin deposits -- cost the insurer $13 million to $14.5 million.The insurer had to cover the shortfall in deposits after thedisappearance of Heritage President Joseph Mollicone Jr. lastfall. Mr. Mollicone has been charged in state and federalarrest warrants with embezzlement.   Mr. Whitehouse said state officials aren't sure how muchmoney Rhode Island Share andamp; Deposit has left. The insurer toldthem its reserves are about $8 million. But Peter A. Nevola,president of the insurer, said in a telephone interview withthe Associated Press that he believes reserves had beenincreased to $17 million to $18 million following anadditional assessment on its membership after the Heritagecollapse.   State-operated, or private insurers in other states,including Maryland and Ohio, also have had problems in recentyears after bank failures depleted the reserves of theinsurers. With fewer members than national deposit insurers,the smaller deposit insurers can have more trouble meetingobligations when a member institution fails.   As a result, only a handful of states still allow some oftheir smallest institutions to operate without federalinsurance, and even those states are steering banks andcredit unions away from private funds.</TEXT></DOC>
