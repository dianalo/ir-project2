INTRODUCTION</ITAG>A. Purpose and ScopeThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today is issuing one in a seriesof guidelines designed to encourage the use of products containing materialsrecovered from solid waste. Section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act,as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRAor the Act), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6962, states that if a procuring agencypurchases certain designated items, such items must be composed of thehighest percentage of recovered materials practicable. EPA is requiredto designate these items and to prepare guidelines to assist procuringagencies in complying with the requirements of section 6002.EPA issued the first of these guidelines, for cement and concrete containingfly ash, on January 28, 1983 (48 FR 4230; 40 CFR Part 249). After that,EPA issued a final guideline for paper and paper products containing recoveredmaterials on June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23546; 40 CFR Part 250), a final guidelinefor lubricating oils containing re-refined oil on June 30, 1988 (53 FR24699; 40 CFR Part 252), and a final guideline for retread tires on November17, 1988 (53 FR 46558; 40 CFR Part 253). A guideline for building insulationproducts was proposed on August 2, 1988 (53 FR 29165). Today, EPA is promulgatingthe final building insulation products guideline.This preamble describes the requirements of section 6002, explains thebasis for designating building insulation products as procurement itemssubject to section 6002, discusses EPA's recommendations for implementingsection 6002 with respect to procurement of building insulation products,and responds to comments on the proposed guideline. It also provides informationregarding the price, availability, and performance of building insulationproducts.B. Requirements of Section 6002Section 6002 of RCRA, ``Federal Procurement,'' directs all procuring agencieswhich use Federal funds to procure items composed of the highest percentageof recovered materials practicable, considering competition, availability,technical performance, and cost. Two factors trigger this requirement.First, EPA must designate the items to which this requirement applies.Second, the requirement only applies when the purchase price of the itemexceeds $10,000 or when the quantity of such items, or of functionallyequivalent items, purchased or acquired in the course of the precedingfiscal year was $10,000 or more.In addition, Federal agencies responsible for drafting or reviewing specificationsfor procurement items were required under section 6002(d)(1) to reviewand revise the specifications by May 8, 1986 in order to eliminate bothexclusions of recovered materials and requirements that items be manufacturedfrom virgin materials. Within one year after the date of publication ofa procurement guideline by EPA, the Federal agencies must revise theirspecifications to require the use of recovered materials in such itemsto the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intended end useof the item.Furthermore, section 6002(c) requires procuring agencies to obtain fromvendors an estimate of and certification regarding the percentage of recoveredmaterials contained in their products.Section 501 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L.98-616) (HSWA) then added paragraph (i) to section 6002 of RCRA. This provisionrequires procuring agencies to develop an affirmative procurement programfor procuring items designated by EPA. The program must assure that itemscomposed of recovered materials will be purchased to the maximum extentpracticable, be consistent with applicable provisions of Federal procurementlaw, and contain at least four elements:(1) A recovered materials preference program;(2) An agency promotion program;(3) A program for requiring estimates, certification, and verificationof recovered material content; and(4) Annual review and monitoring of the effectiveness of the procurementprogram.Under section 6002(e), EPA is required to issue guidelines for use by procuringagencies in complying with the requirements of section 6002. The EPA guidelinesmust designate those items which can be produced with recovered materialsand whose procurement by procuring agencies will fulfill the objectivesof section 6002. They also must provide recommendations for procurementpractices and information on availability, relative price, and performance.Section 6002 is designed to promote materials conservation and therebyto reduce the quantity of materials in the solid waste stream. By usingproducts containing recovered materials, Federal procurement can demonstratetheir technical and economic viability. In addition, Federal procurementguidelines can provide guidance to state and local governments interestedin procuring products containing recovered materials, and Federal procurementof such products is expected to result in increased procurement by theseagencies as well.C. Criteria for Selection of Procurement ItemsIn the preamble to the fly ash guideline, EPA established the followingfour criteria for the selection of procurement items for which guidelineswill be prepared (48 FR 4231-4232, January 28, 1983):(1) The waste material must constitute a significant solid waste managementproblem due either to volume, degree of hazard, or difficulties in disposal;(2) Economic methods of separation and recovery must exist;(3) The material must have technically proven uses; and(4) The Federal government's ability to affect purchasing or use of thefinal product or recovered material must be substantial.These criteria incorporate all of the factors which section 6002(e) requiresEPA to consider in designating items subject to the section 6002 procurementrequirements.Section III of this preamble demonstrates that building insulation productsmade with recovered materials meet the criteria for designation. Industrialbyproducts currently used to produce building insulation products are alsodiscussed in more detail.D. Background Information on Insulation Products Containing Recovered Materials<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction to Insulation</ITAG>There are many applications for insulation, including building insulationto provide human comfort, equipment insulation, pipe insulation, and refrigerationor cold storage insulation. Building insulation accounts for by far thelargest volume of insulation manufactured and is least likely to requirespecialty products or materials for special insulation purposes. Moreover,the building insulation market is dominated by products which can, andoften do, contain recovered materials.In this guideline, ``building insulation,'' ``building insulation products,''and ``insulation products'' all refer to the insulation uses and producttypes that follow.<T3>Building insulation</T3> refers to a material, primarily designed toresist heat flow, which is installed between the conditioned (heated and/ormechanically cooled) volume of a building and adjacent, unconditioned volumesor the outside. This term includes but is not limited to products suchas blanket, board, spray-in-place, and loose-fill insulation.Locations suitable for the installation of building insulation includebut are not limited to ceilings, floors, foundations, and walls. Ceilinginsulation is used between the conditioned area of a building and an unconditionedattic, in common ceiling floor assemblies between separately conditionedunits in multi-unit structures, and between the underside and uppersideof the roof where the conditioned area of a building extends to the roofs.Floor insulation is used between the first level conditioned area of abuilding and an unconditioned basement, a crawl space, or the outside beneathit; and around the perimeter of or on a ground level concrete slab wherethe first level conditioned area of a building is on a slab. Foundationinsulation is used at foundation walls between conditioned volumes andunconditioned volumes and the outside or surrounding earth, at the perimetersof concrete slab-on-grade foundations, and at common foundation wall assembliesbetween conditioned basement volumes. Wall insulation is used within oron the walls between conditioned areas of a building and unconditionedareas of a building or the outside, and in common wall assemblies betweenseparately conditioned units in multiple unit structures.The principal categories of insulating materials are fiberglass, plasticrigid foams (polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, glass fiber reinforced polyisocyanurate/polyurethane,polystyrene, and phenolic), rock wool, and cellulose. These materials aresometimes used in combination in composite products. Insulation productsmade from these materials dominate the insulation market and are the primaryfocus of this guideline.There also are specialty materials, principally calcium silicate, vermiculite,and perlite, used for insulation products. These materials are virgin mineralswhich are not recycled, and they represent a relatively small part of theinsulation market. These minerals, as well as other specialty materials,however, can also be mixed in composite products with other materials whichcan contain recovered materials (e.g., perlite composite board).The primary factors in the choice of insulating material are thermal resistance(R-value); performance standards; impacts on indoor air quality; price;availability; life-cycle cost considering the installed cost of insulationin relation to the estimated reduction in energy cost over the life ofthe product in use; flammability; corrosiveness of the insulating materialsto metallic building components; ease and cost of installation; durability;resistance to moisture absorption; strength; retention of insulating valuewith time; the dimensions of, and access to, the space to be insulated;and the thickness of the insulation desired.The process of selecting appropriate thermal insulation for buildings canbe broken down in steps as follows:1. The building type and function is first established, with a view tolocal, national or government codes and standards. Of particular importanceare fire safety and life safety considerations, which affect necessaryinsulation characteristics, such as insulation flamespread and potentialsmoke or off-gassing of ignited or smoldering insulation. Another considerationis off-gassing of installed materials which can affect indoor air quality.2. The preliminary design of the exterior building envelope is examined,in relation to the appropriate insulation form and the availability ofspace for the insulation, within the anticipated exterior building assemblies.At this point, a preliminary decision may be made as to whether loose fill,flexible blanket, or rigid materials (or combinations of these) will befinally selected. Thermal resistance (R-value) requirements are then finalized,coordinating these as necessary to dimensions and other considerationssuch as codes.3. Installation requirements are then considered. Does the insulation requireadditional support, installed by other skilled workers? Is some form offacing or covering material required for fire safety? Will the workersnormally installing the insulation be familiar with the material specifiedand how it should be placed? Will scheduling of other workers be affected?What level of supervision or inspection is necessary? Other installationconsiderations may apply, depending on the size and complexity of the building.4. The level of material and installation costs to be expected is estimated,both as a flat figure and in relation to anticipated building heating andcooling requirements. Installation costs should include all ancillary costsas outlined above.5. Material specification compliance with code or owner requirements arechecked, and provision of certificates of compliance, as appropriate, isadded as a specification clause.6. Specification sections, covering necessary inspections, clean-up andany other prepayment requirements are added, as desired.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Types of Recovered Materials Used</ITAG>At present, several of the major types of insulation are commercially availablewith recovered materials content, which is defined by RCRA section 1004(19)as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Waste material and byproducts which have been recovered or divertedfrom solid waste, but such term does not include those materials and byproductsgenerated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process.</ITAG>Some types of insulation are produced using postconsumer materials as feedstocks.An example of this is cellulose insulation, which is made from old newspaper.Others rely on recovered byproducts as feedstocks, such as rock wool insulation,which is primarily made from slags from smelting processes. Fiberglassmanufacturers use waste glass from other industries. Plastic foam insulationis made with chemical byproducts, such as dimethyl terephthalate (DMT),which would otherwise be discarded.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Insulation Industry</ITAG>The following information puts the insulation industry in perspective.The national energy conservation movement caused the insulation industryto grow substantially until 1984. From 1984 to the present, the insulationindustry has shown little or no growth. According to the estimated marketshare based on dollar volume, fiberglass is the predominant insulationmaterial (68 percent), followed by plastic rigid foams (21 percent), rockwool (3 percent), cellulose (3 percent), and all other types includingvermiculite, perlite and other specialties (5 percent). Recently, rockwool and fiberglass have lost the greatest share of the market, while plasticfoams have been growing most substantially.During the energy crunch of the late 70s, producers of fiberglass and mineralwool were not able to meet demand. From the mid-70s to the early 80s, fiberglassslipped from 85 percent of the market to around 70 percent, losing marketshare to cellulose and foam plastics. Neither fiberglass nor rock woolhave recovered their market positions.Cellulose fiber plants expanded from 98 in 1973 to 750 in l978, but theindustry contracted severely after 1977, losing 60 percent of productioncapacity by 1984.An estimate of the 1986 total dollar volume of building insulation at manufacturer'snet price is $2.9 billion as shown in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._1986 <T4>Sales of Insulation</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Commercial and industrial roofs<D>$1,150,000,000 </D></ITAG>Residential building: <ITAG tagnum="2">Attic<D>340,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Cavity<D>220,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Sheathing<D>165,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Slab andamp; basement<D>100,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Residential retrofit<D>666,090,000 </D></ITAG>Non-residential building: <ITAG tagnum="2">Cavity<D>225,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Slab andamp; foundation<D>35,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>$2,901,090,000 </D><F>Source: Hull andamp; Company and A.W.

Moreover, because government funds are used for alltypes of construction, distinctions between uses have not been considerednecessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Rationale for Designating Building Insulation Products </ITAG>This section of the preamble demonstrates that building insulation productssatisfy EPA's criteria for designating items subject to the procurementrequirements of RCRA section 6002. A. Significant Solid Waste Disposal Problem The first criterion is that the waste material constitutes a significantsolid waste management problem. The waste materials of immediate concernin the production of building insulation are postconsumer newspaper, containerglass, and plastics. Each material represents a significant fraction ofthe municipal solid waste stream as shown by the data in Table 2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s150,14,14,14,14</C><T4> Table </T4>2._<T4>Selected Items in the Municipal Solid Waste Stream </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In percent of total discards and thousands of tons]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Total discards</H1><H1>Newspaper</H1><H1>Glass containers</H1><H1>Plastic containers</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1980<D>125,700 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Percent of total</ITAG><D/><D>6.5%</D><D>10.5%</D><D>1.7% </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Tons per year</ITAG><D/><D>8,100</D><D>13,200</D><D>2,100 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">1982<D>124,900 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Percent of total</ITAG><D/><D>6.1%</D><D>10.2%</D><D>1.6% </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Tons per year</ITAG><D/><D>7,600</D><D>12,800</D><D>2,000 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>133,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Percent of total</ITAG><D/><D>6.7%</D><D>8.9%</D><D>1.8% </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Tons per year</ITAG><D/><D>9,000</D><D>11,800</D><D>2,400 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">1990<D>141,400 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Percent of total</ITAG><D/><D>6.7%</D><D>8.0%</D><D>2.1% </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Tons per year</ITAG><D/><D>9,700</D><D>11,300</D><D>2,900 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">1995<D>149,900 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Percent of total</ITAG><D/><D>7.0%</D><D>7.4%</D><D>2.3% </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Tons per year </ITAG><D/><D>10,500 </D><D>11,100 </D><D>3,400 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">2000 <D>158,800 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Percent of total</ITAG><D> </D><D>7.2% </D><D>6.8% </D><D>2.5% </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Tons per year </ITAG><D/><D>11,400 </D><D>10,800 </D><D>3,900 </D><F>Source: Franklin Associates, Ltd., 1986.</F></ITAG> In addition, metallurgical slags and certain chemicals are industrial byproductswhich would contribute to the industrial waste stream if they were notused in products like insulation. Some manufacturing wastes, such as plateglass and plastics, raise the same concerns. Although use of these byproductsand manufacturing wastes is already substantial, concerns remain aboutthe contribution of the unrecycled portion to the industrial waste streambecause of the large quantity of material involved. Each of the solid waste categories result from different industries andare used in different insulation materials. Therefore each category isdiscussed separately. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Newspaper </ITAG>Newspaper is the most easily recycled material in the residential wastestream and therefore is targeted for collection most frequently. Problemsof oversupply of recycled old newspaper have appeared in the Eastern states.The number of recycling programs mandated by municipal and State requirementsnationwide that are currently in place or in the planning stages suggeststhat the oversupply problem may become severe nationwide in the near future.The category ``old newspaper'' contains overissue newspapers (newspapersunsold to the public which do not always enter the municipal waste stream)and postconsumer newspaper. Old newspaper is primarily consumed by thepaper industry for a variety of recycled paper products and by the celluloseinsulation industry. Substantial quantities are also exported out of thecountry. In 1983, actual demand for old newspaper, including demand from the paperindustry, exporters, and the cellulose insulation industry was 3.67 millionshort tons. Estimated 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 demand was 3.93 million,3.96 million, 4.23 million, and 4.58 million short tons, respectively.The estimated growth in demand from 1983 to 1987 was therefore 915,700short tons or 24.9 percent.To compare demand with supply, total United States and Canadian productioncapacity for newsprint in 1985 was 16.58 million short tons, with consumptionof newsprint by United States publishers being 13.1 million short tonsin 1986. In 1987, the newsprint industry announced a production capacityexpansion of 1.63 million short tons to be in place by 1990, approximatelya 10 percent increase, with 338,000 tons of this new capacity to be producedfrom old newspaper.In 1986, unused old newspaper supply (total U.S. newsprint consumptionless demand for old newspaper) was 8.71 million short tons. Assuming newspaperquickly enters the waste flow, the 1986 national recovery efforts representedjust under 33 percent of available supplies. National recovery of a feasible50 percent of available supplies would recycle an additional 2.32 milliontons. Assuming all factors remain the same, this would require an increasein demand for old newspapers of 55 percent over 1986 levels. This is morethan twice the growth in demand for the past four years. The new NorthAmerican production capacity which is expected to be on line by late 1990would raise the necessary growth rate in old newspaper use to over 65 percentin order to achieve the same 50 percent recovery rate.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Glass</ITAG>The largest volume of waste glass in the solid waste stream comes fromcontainers. According to industry spokesmen, recycling of glass has increased,with glass container plants currently using an average of 20 to 30 percentof cullet in their mix. Some plants use considerably higher percentagesif the cullet is readily available.U.S. Department of Commerce data on container production shows that 309million gross containers with a net packed weight of 12.7 million tonswere produced in 1982. In 1985 and 1986, production was 273 million and283 million gross with net packed weight of 11.10 million and 11 milliontons, respectively. The increase in container quantities from 1985 to 1986may be due to the stronger economy or to increased use of glass in microwave,wine cooler and other specialty containers.According to 1982 Census of Manufacturers data, the glass container industryconsumed 1.66 million tons of glass cullet (in-plant, pre-, and post-consumer)and 13.82 million tons of other materials, including 8 million tons ofsand. This represents 11 percent cullet to the total feedstocks. If alldocumented 1982 cullet consumption in the container industry was postconsumerglass, an unlikely assumption, it would have represented only 13 percentof potential postconsumer cullet supplies, which as previously stated,were 12.7 million tons.Another use of postconsumer bottle cullet, as a substitute aggregate inasphalt paving, has been explored since the 1960s. Experimentation hasincreased in the 1980s, and this use appears to be very promising. However,no data exist for the quantities of cullet in current use nor for the potentialdemand if ``glassphalt'' becomes a common paving practice.As of January 1988, it was not difficult to find buyers for postconsumerbottle cullet within reasonable transportation radii. The container industry,using existing equipment, is capable and willing to double its consumption.The only limitation is lack of supplies that are consistent in quantityand quality. The market for postconsumer bottle cullet will also increaseas ``glassphalt'' is used more commonly.Published data on preconsumer or manufacturing waste glass (including flatand window glass, table and cookware and so on) which is brokered to otherusers is not available. The glass processing industry estimates that approximately500,000 tons per year changes hands. Such waste glass, with the exceptionof automotive windshield wastes which are very difficult to process, generallyenter the waste disposal system only when consumers of cullet are beyondeconomic transportation distances. However, both fluctuations in the businesscycle and periodic dislocations in supply or demand can cause inventoriesto be stockpiled and possibly discarded.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Plastic</ITAG>Plastics have increased steadily in the waste stream according to datapresented in the EPA waste characterization report. Plastic disposal grewfrom 0.5 million tons in 1960 to 9.6 million tons in 1984 or 7 percent(by weight) of total residential waste. Plastics are expected to increaseto 10 percent of the waste by the year 2000. Although many types of plasticare included in the general trend, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene(PS), and manufacturing wastes (DMT and phthalic anhydride bottoms) wereanalyzed for solid waste management impacts because they are the only recoveredplastics apt to be used in insulation products.Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Trade indicates thatPET use is growing faster than other plastic container resins. From 1985to 1986, PET use grew 37.5 percent compared with high density polyethylene(12.9 percent), low and medium density polyethylene (25.9 percent), polypropylene(4.8 percent), polyvinyl chloride (9.5 percent), polystyrene and others(29.4 percent). The quantity of PS in containers is small, and miscellaneousother resins are included in the data. The rapid growth in PET use is presentedin Table 3.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s125,15,15,r125</C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4> Consumption of PET in Plastic Bottle Materials</T4><H1>Year </H1><H1>Million lbs. </H1><H1>Tons </H1><H1>Percent growth</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1983 <D>420.5 </D><D>210,250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984 <D>452.0 </D><D>226,000 </D><D>7%.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985 <D>480.0 </D><D>240,000 </D><D>6% estimate.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986 <D>660.0 </D><D>330,000 </D><D>37.5% estimate.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987 <D>800.0 </D><D>400,000 </D><D>21% forecast.</D><F>Source: U.S. Department of Commerce.</F></ITAG></ITAG>There are two types of postconsumer PET easily available, containers andused film stock. Industry sources state that PET production for packagingis approaching 1 billion pounds per year with approximately 150 millionpounds (or 15 percent) currently recycled. The industry is targeting 2billion pounds of PET for packaging by 1990. All film stock, includingx-ray, photographic and micrographic, is extruded PET. According to industrysources, approximately 600 million pounds of PET film stock is producedannually. About one third, or 200 million pounds, is x-ray film. Whilespecific data on disposal of used x-ray film is not gathered, one sourcestated that approximately 200 million pounds of used x-ray film is disposedof annually, of which about 10 percent or 20 million pounds is recycled.In addition to postconsumer plastic bottles and film, an average of 5 percentof every type of plastic resin production becomes manufacturers' or industrialwaste plastic annually. Polyester resin production was 6.3 billion poundsin 1985. The amount of manufacturer's polyester waste generated in 1985was estimated to be 315 million pounds. Total supplies of recyclable PETfrom bottles, x-ray film, and industrial wastes can be roughly estimatedto be 1.25 billion pounds annually. The Society of the Plastics Industry reported 1986 production of PS resinto be 4.47 billion pounds. Approximately 1.36 billion pounds were producedfor packaging and 418 million pounds for building construction. Productioncapacity was reported to be 5.39 billion pounds. Recycling of postconsumer PS from the municipal waste stream is just beingattempted, and data on manufacturers' waste PS is not gathered. For 1986,industrial waste was estimated to be 5 percent of production or 223.5 millionpounds. Manufacturing waste PS is regularly brokered. EPA identified another industrial waste that is used to produce plasticrigid foam insulation, dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) bottoms. Bottoms arethe heavy fraction, or residue, of a production process, which may or maynot have recoverable materials. An EPA data base of plastic industry wasteproducts suggests that DMT wastes that potentially had value were not recoveredfor sale in 1981; this data base contained only a partial sample of 1981data, however. Those DMT wastes with value were recovered for internaluse or were burned to extract energy value. DMT wastes without apparentvalue (e.g., very dilute) did not appear to be recovered at all but weredisposed in a variety of ways. Another industrial waste, phthalic anhydride bottoms may also be used,but this has not been documented nor are quantity data and informationon phthalic anhydride wastes currently available from the EPA data base.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Slag </ITAG>Slag is a by-product from blast furnaces and other metal smelting processes.According to the National Slag Association, metallurgical slags from theproduction of iron and steel do not represent a significant solid wastemanagement problem. Stockpiles are said to be used efficiently in most,though not all, parts of the country. Iron-blast-furnace slag (the generalterm) sold or used totaled 15.4 million short tons in 1986, of which 88percent or 13.5 million tons were air-cooled iron blast furnace slag. Roadconstruction materials, such as road base and substitute aggregates inconcrete and asphalt, absorbed 81 percent of the total supply. Rock woolmanufacturers purchased 519,000 short tons, or 3.8 percent of the air-coolediron blast furnace slag. According to recent Bureau of Mines data, purchasesof slag for rock wool fell from 617,000 short tons in 1985 to 519,000 shorttons in 1986. Based on current data, EPA believes that the major volumes of metallurgicalslags are recycled and do not currently represent a nationwide solid wastemanagement problem. However, increased iron and steel production, increasingcompetition from other recovered materials in roadbuilding, and changesin the national economy could adversely affect the balance of supply anddemand for metallurgical slags in the future with a resulting impact onsolid waste disposal. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Spent Aluminum Potliner </ITAG>A commenter recommended that EPA add to the guideline mineral wool madewith spent aluminum potliner from primary aluminum reduction. Potlinerwas recently listed as a hazardous waste by EPA because it contains cyanide,so in this instance, toxicity as well as quantity are the management problemsof concern. Primary reduction of aluminum takes place in a ``pot,'' a strongly reinforcedsteel box lined with an insulating layer and carbon to resist corrosionand abrasion. The lining must be replaced approximately every five yearsand becomes ``spent potliner.'' The spent potliner is a dark, concrete-likematerial that contains fluoride, carbon, and cyanides. Approximately 130,000tons are produced each year by the primary aluminum industry. EPA listed ``spent potliner from primary aluminum reduction'' as a hazardouswaste on September 13, 1988 (53 FR 35412). The aluminum industry has alreadypursued recycling/reuse of spent potliner, however. The carbon is a goodsource of energy as a fuel supplement, while the fluoride values can beused to promote chemical reactions, as a fluxing agent or as part of achemical feedstock. The industry estimates the 1988 recycling rate to beabout 15 percent. Prior to the listing of spent potliner as a hazardouswaste, the aluminum industry projected a 1988 recycling rate of 35-40 percent.One of the viable recycling technologies is use as a fuel and fluoridefeedstock for mineral wool production. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Conclusions </ITAG>EPA concludes that newspaper and plastics (PET and PS) in the municipalwaste stream represent solid waste management problems based on quantity.Current supplies of postconsumer glass are used efficiently, and the containerindustry is capable of doubling its consumption of postconsumer cullet.Manufacturing wastes (such as plate glass and plastic scrap) as well asindustrial byproducts (such as metallurgical slags and chemical bottoms),which qualify under the RCRA definition of recovered materials, would alsopresent solid waste management problems based on quantity if current marketsare interrupted. Spent aluminum potliner represents both quantity and toxicityproblems, which will persist if efforts to recycle/reuse the material arecurtailed due to listing of the material as a hazardous waste. B. Feasible Methods of Recovery The second EPA criterion for selection of reclaimed materials for affirmativeprocurement under RCRA Section 6002 is the existence of economic methodsof separation and recovery. Source separation programs in operation and in the planning stages alltarget newspaper and container glass, and some target container plastics(particularly PET in bottle bill states). Materials are picked up throughcurb-side collection programs, drop-off centers, charity drives and soon. There is no national count of such recycling programs, but in somestates there are as many as 200 local programs. More programs are beingimplemented each year. Government-sponsored collection programs are beingsubsidized because state-sponsored economic analyses have indicated thatrecycling is less expensive than other disposal options. There also isa healthy system of brokers for materials collected by source separationprograms as well as all types of manufacturers' waste materials. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Newspaper </ITAG>Recycling programs mandated by municipal and State laws always target postconsumernewspaper. The waste paper brokerage system handles a large proportionof this postconsumer newspaper as well as the pre-consumer or overissuewaste newspaper.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Glass</ITAG>The Glass Packaging Institute reported in 1987 that seventeen non-bottlebill states and the District of Columbia have joined individual state orjoint state associations to foster collection of glass containers and publicizeredemption centers. For example, the Pennsylvania Glass Recycling Corporationpublishes a newsletter that listed forty-three ``glass for cash'' centerswithin the state in 1987. Beverage Industry Recycling Programs (BIRPs)serve some of the same non-bottle bill states as well as three others.In addition, ten bottle bill states have developed glass collection andprocessing systems. The EPA waste characterization report\1\<NOTE/> estimated that 1.25 million tons of glass were recycled in1986, just under ten percent of the available supply. This compares with368,000 tons, or barely three percent, ten years earlier.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States, 1960to 2000 (Update 1988)</T3> (Franklin Associates, Ltd., March 30, 1988).Processing centers have been established in both bottle bill and non-bottlebill states to crush and clean glass to market specifications. While nationaldata is not gathered on the numbers of these facilities nor the quantitiesof cullet they handle, new processing centers, both public and private,are opening in urban areas all around the country.Three markets for postconsumer glass are the container industry, ``glassphalt''producers, and fiberglass manufacturers. The container glass industry requiresbottle cullet to be color-sorted, a labor intensive process which eitherrequires citizens to do the color separating or requires hand sorting linesat the processing centers. Mixed-color cullet is suitable for an aggregatesubstitute in ``glassphalt''. The fiberglass industry has accepted color-mixedcullet in the past, although the industry claims that fiberglass furnacesare much more sensitive than container furnaces to contaminants such ascarbon,  plastics, and metals. Recycling programs are being proposed and implemented that stress quantityover color separation for glass. If sufficient demand develops for color-mixedcullet, it should become available because it is less expensive to collect.The technology has already been developed to prepare cullet for aggregatesubstitutes. Additional processing to remove contaminants and to preparecolor-mixed cullet to fiberglass industry specifications is more complexand therefore more expensive. This technology currently exists at largeprocessors. It is possible that additional processing lines will be developedif supplies of postconsumer cullet are greater than other markets can absorb.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Plastic</ITAG>Postconsumer PET containers are recovered primarily in the bottle billstates, although some additional state and local governments are planningcollection for PET and other plastic containers. According to the EPA wastecharacterization report referenced above, 63,000 tons of soft drink bottles(PET with high density polyethylene (HDPE) base cups) were recovered in1984 from bottle bill states. This represented 18 percent of national productionand 1 percent of gross plastic discards.Used x-ray film and other film stock is processed to recover silver nitrateand other metals, then is routed for further contaminant removal and saleor to disposal facilities. At least one company has been established todecontaminate x-ray plastics and market clean PET film scrap. In 1987,throughput at this mill was about 6 million pounds per year. The designcapacity for the mill is 48 million pounds (or 24,000 short tons) per year.This capacity represents approximately 25 percent of the estimated usedx-ray stock.Postconsumer PS was not being recovered for recycling as of December, 1987.During 1988, the industry began to develop pilot programs to collect foampolystyrene food service materials from fast food restaurants and institutions,but it is still too early to determine how effective these programs willbe. Although data is not gathered systematically for manufacturing wastePS, one broker roughly estimated that 200 million pounds of crystallineand foam PS are purchased and sold in some form to other users. If wastePS can be accumulated in 40,000 pound truckloads, and if these wastes meetspecifications for contamination, users can be found.The network of waste plastic brokers will handle any plastic waste forwhich it can find an economically feasible market. This entails a marketvalue high enough to cover the costs of processing and transportation.DMT bottoms are in commercial use and therefore are economically feasibleto recover. The use of phthalic anhydride bottoms has not yet been documented.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Slag</ITAG>Metallurgical slag is used as an aggregate substitute in road constructionand as the raw material for most rock wool insulation made in the UnitedStates. Collection and transportation of this industrial byproduct appearsto be well established.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Spent Aluminum Potliner</ITAG>The aluminum industry routinely removes spent potliner and stores it priorto disposal. Some purchasers exist for this material, and the aluminumindustry is actively exploring additional uses.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Conclusions</ITAG>EPA has concluded that feasible recovery methods exist for postconsumernewspaper, glass, and PET plastics. Postconsumer PS may be recoverablebut methods have not yet been proven. The industrial byproducts, slag,DMT bottoms, and spent aluminum potliner, as well as preconsumer (or manufacturingwaste) PET, PS and glass cullet, are also recovered efficiently.C. Technically Proven UsesThe third EPA criterion for selection of reclaimed materials for affirmativeprocurement under RCRA section 6002 is that the material has technicallyproven uses in the designated items. Recovered materials currently arecommercially acceptable feedstocks in four types of insulating materialcovered by the guideline issued today: cellulose, composites, the plasticrigid foams, and rock wool.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Cellulose</ITAG>For purposes of this guideline, cellulose is defined as vegetable fibersuch as paper, wood, or cane. There are two types of cellulose insulationproducts_cellulose loosefill and fiberboards made from cellulose.a.<T3> Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on insulation.</T3> Cellulose insulationis made from approximately 75 percent waste paper; the remaining portionconsists of chemicals to retard flammability and to deter insects and pests.While there is some spray-on cellulose insulation made from waste paper,the industry predominately makes loose-fill insulation which is blown intowalls and attics.Cellulose insulation comprises about 3 percent of the insulation marketaccording to a 1987 industry estimate. The cellulose insulation producedin 1984 consumed approximately 480,000 tons of recycled paper. More recentdata has not been obtained.The Department of Commerce listed 371 manufacturers of cellulose insulationin 1983. Four years later, in July 1987, the Cellulose Industry StandardsEnforcement Program (CISEP) identified 138 active firms. This indicatescontinued shrinkage in the cellulose insulation industry. Thirteen of thecompanies identified by CISEP produced approximately 20 percent of thecellulose insulation manufactured in 1987. Cellulose insulation manufacturersare located all across the country; consequently availability to procurementagencies should present no problems. b. <T3>Fiberboard made with cellulose. </T3>These fiberboards are made inpanels of varying thicknesses from wood, cane or paper fibers. They areoften called insulating boards, although they are frequently used for structuralreasons rather than for their insulation properties. The American Societyof Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) usesthe general term ``vegetable fiber board'' and includes within the category:sheathing, nail-base sheathing, shingle backer, sound deadening board,tile and lay-in boards, laminated paperboard, and homogenous board fromrepulped paper. The R-value, according to ASHRAE, is about 2. Fiberboard manufacturers no longer have a trade association, and data regardingmarket share is not available. The American Paper Institute groups dataabout ``insulating boards'' within the construction paper and board category.Estimated production of insulating board for 1986 to 1989 remained flatat 1,178,000 short tons. The entire construction paper and board categorywas estimated at 2.2 million short tons, with estimated consumption ofrecovered paper materials growing from 929,000 short tons in 1986 to justover 1 million short tons in 1989. The recovered paper feedstocks werepredominantly postconsumer newspaper, mixed paper, and corrugated. Thereis no estimate of recovered paper consumption for insulating boards alone.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Perlite Composite Board </ITAG>Some composite boards are made with expanded perlite aggregate (a virginmineral), small amounts of selected binders, and waste newspapers. Thematerials are mixed together and formed into rigid, flat, rectangular unitswhich may have facings on one or both sides according to the ASTM C-728-82standard specification. Perlite composite board is primarily used for commercial-and industrial-type roof insulation. Market growth follows growth in thegross national product and is expected to remain at 1987 levels for thenext few years. Approximately 0.2 pounds of newspaper is used per board foot of the finishedproduct. Approximately 500 million board feet were produced in 1987 bythe only two known manufacturers, consuming about 50,000 tons of wastenewspaper. The percentage  of newspaper to other ingredients varies from23 percent to 30 percent, with the average about 24 percent. The percentagevaries according to the technical requirements of different finished products.The paper provides strength while the perlite provides insulating properties.Product availability to government procuring agencies is limited only becauseit is manufactured by just two companies. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Fiberglass Insulation </ITAG>Fiberglass insulation is primarily made from sand, limestone, soda ash,and boron. There are other materials added to product mixes in small quantities.The materials are melted together and spun into filaments called ``batt.''Cullet is a substitute for sand, limestone, and soda ash. Boron, the mostexpensive primary ingredient, is not contained in bottle or plate glasscullet. Recovered materials used in fiberglass insulation products include pre-consumerwaste glass from other manufacturing processes, such as plate glass, containerglass, transition cullet (material from glass furnaces produced while mixesare being changed), as well as postconsumer bottle cullet in isolated instances.Home scrap produced in the manufacturing process is called re-feed by thefiberglass industry and is usually consumed by the generator. Two types of furnaces are used to melt ingredients for fiberglass insulation,electric and gas- or propane-fired. Although both types of furnaces aregenerally used by each company, a large portion of production uses electricmelt. The manufacturers state that the electric furnaces are especiallysensitive to organic contaminants. Even trace amounts can cause operationalproblems and may result in a production line shut down. Electric furnacesare said by the industry to have advantages in environmental emissionscontrol. The gas- or propane-fired furnaces are somewhat more tolerantof contaminants. The manufacturers state, however, that even these furnacescannot accept cullet as readily as bottle/container furnaces because: (1)The furnaces are smaller in size and refining area, (2) melting temperaturesare typically lower and therefore contaminants are not liquified as readily,(3) batch residence times are generally shorter, which results in lowertolerances for non-uniform cullet and, (4) the fiberizing process is verysensitive to variations in batch composition. The fiberglass industry states that mixed-color waste glass (pre- or postconsumer)can be used if the mixtures are consistent batch to batch. The industryfurther states however, that green and amber bottle cullet introduce tracemetals used to create the colors, which can cause difficulties in fiberglassfurnaces. Variations in quantities of the colors change the characteristicsof melt, and therefore require costly process adjustments.Some manufacturers have stated that there are production advantages inusing recycled glass. Melting cullet instead of melting virgin materialsprovides energy savings. In the proposed guideline, EPA stated the energysavings to be 10-15 percent. Commenters from the industry stated that thesavings are considerably lower. One producer estimated 0.3 percent pereach 1 percent of cullet in the batch; another found 1 percent of energysavings for each 10 percent of cullet used. Cullet use is also said tospeed up production lines, increasing the production rate. At least onefiberglass plant intermittently experimented with 40 percent or more cullet,including postconsumer bottle cullet, in 1986. However, this is not commonto the industry and was discontinued by the parent company when the plantwas closed. Another company, using a European fiberizing process, has beenexperimenting with using low percentages of cullet; according to the company,however, the expected production advantages have not resulted. Other manufacturers consider bottle cullet to be an unacceptable feedstockfor a number of reasons. First, and most important, it is not consistentlyavailable, which would interrupt long term contracts from feedstock suppliersof limestone, soda ash, and sand. Long term contracts for feedstocks tendto stabilize the costs of production and assure preferred customer statusin times of raw material scarcity. Second, as discussed above, batchesof postconsumer mixed-color bottle cullet do not consistently contain thesame percentages of individual colors, which causes processing disruptions.Third, price is a restraint on using bottle cullet. At 1986 costs of production,a price of $.02-.025 per pound ($40-$50 per ton) for green glass culletwas said to be acceptable. The fourth factor is contaminants. While culletdoes not have to be color sorted, even minor contamination with metal,plastics, ceramics, or carbon causes problems in fiberglass processinglines. Fiberglass industry commenters stated that specifications for pre- andpostconsumer cullet vary from company to company and plant to plant becausedifferent manufacturing processes are used. Size specifications can varyfrom the consistency of sand (minus andplusmin;16 mesh_plus andplusmin;100mesh) up to half inch chunks. The following contaminant specificationsoffer general guidance only: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,xs52 </C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Fiberglass Specifications </T4><H1>Contaminant </H1><H1>Content</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Moisture <D>Less than 2%. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Organic carbon (e.g., sugars, paper, plastic, milk, residues) <D>Less than 1%. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Coatings/oxides (e.g., silver, iron oxide, lead oxide, chrome oxide,cobalt oxide, tin oxide) <D>Less than 1% (usually). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Magnetic materials <D>0%. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Foreign materials (e.g., stones, ceramics, non-magnetic metals) <D>0%.</D></ITAG></ITAG> In Europe, a French company is said to use substantial proportions of plateand bottle cullet in some of its installations; the same company manufacturesthe bottles and the plate glass and therefore has the advantage of knowingexactly what is contained in the cullet it uses. According to the Europeantrade association, EURIMA, production of multiple products occurs at otherEuropean companies, but it is not common. Companies in Germany and Belgiumalso use purchased cullet (including bottle cullet) to improve furnaceefficiencies and to save energy. All European companies are said to beexploring the use of cullet but the material is not generally available.As in the United States, European furnaces cannot tolerate impurities incullet. American glass processors do sell postconsumer bottle cullet to fiberglassmanufacturers in some parts of the country, although not in great amounts.The broader category of preconsumer or manufacturing waste cullet is usedmore commonly. While data is not gathered, knowledgeable sources estimate175,000 tons of preconsumer cullet is sold to the fiberglass industry annually.Unlike the glass container industry, which favors bottle cullet partlybecause it contains the key ingredient soda ash, the fiberglass industryobtains much of the needed soda value from other raw materials containingalumina and boron. Therefore, neither soda ash costs nor scarcities havemuch impact on the costs of producing fiberglass. Some fiberglass manufacturers indicated interest in using postconsumercullet if it was available in consistent quantities and quality at competitiveprices. These companies believed that cullet processing technology wouldhave to be improved to meet their specifications for consistent color mixand low contaminant levels. With nearly 70 percent market share, fiberglass dominates the total insulationindustry. In 1987, there were six companies  producing fiberglass insulationat 26 locations. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Plastic Rigid Foams </ITAG>Plastic rigid foam insulation is made by expanding resins to create cells.Blowing agents are used to enhance the formation of cells and, in somecases, the blowing agent remains trapped within the cells to increase insulatingproperties. Rigid foam insulations have higher R-values than equivalentthicknesses of other insulations, although they tend to cost more. Thehigher the R-value, the better the insulating properties. There are several basic types of plastic rigid foam in general use, includingpolyurethane, polyisocyanurate, polystyrene, and phenolics. The use ofplastic rigid foam insulation appears to be growing the most rapidly ofall types of insulation, although data is not consistently published, andinformation from different sources rarely agrees. However, despite variationsin the data, it is established that polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, andpolystyrene foams have an important share of the total market, while phenolicsrepresent a very small though growing fraction of the total. An estimate of total rigid foam boardstock consumption in residential andcommercial applications was presented at a Society of the Plastics Industryconference in 1985. Polyurethane foam use was expected to grow from 230million pounds in 1984 to 249 million pounds and 280 million pounds in1986 and 1990, respectively. Projected polystyrene growth for the sameyears was from 285 to 315 to 375 million pounds. Phenolic growth, againfor 1984, 1986, and 1990, was estimated at 10 to 11 to 15 million pounds.a. <T3>Polyurethane and polyisocyanurate insulation. </T3>References to polyurethane(PU) and polyisocyanurate (PIR) insulations tend to be confusing. The termpolyurethane foam can also refer to the flexible foams used for cushioning.Data for PU and PIR feedstocks and insulation production quantities arefrequently grouped together under the term polyurethane and sometimes areincluded under the broader term urethane (U). The differences between PUand PIR rigid foam are slight and do not affect the use of recovered materials.For simplification in this guideline, the term polyisocyanurate/polyurethane(PIR/PU) will be used, although the original terms will be preserved incited data. PIR/PU insulation is primarily board and laminated board products usedto insulate walls, roofing, and doors in residential and commercial buildings.The physical blowing agent is trapped in the cells of PIR/PU rigid foamsand contributes to the high R-value. PIR/PU board insulation is made with various formulas depending on therequirements of the final product. Ingredients are used in the followingranges:andbullet; Isocyanate, 53-57% andbullet; Aromatic polyester polyol, 20-30% andbullet; Blowing agent, 15-20% andbullet; Surfactants and catalysts, 2-3%.PIR/PU foam-in-place insulation (with two sub-categories, spray-in-placeand pour-in-place) is a smaller segment of the market. It is used primarilyfor roofing insulation and injection into cavities, with some used in wallinsulation. PIR/PU foam-in-place ingredients are combined on site and injectedinto position where the mixture expands and hardens in place. An estimateof the size of the PIR/PU foam-in-place market was developed for the Departmentof Energy. In 1982, approximately 65 million pounds of foam were used,primarily in roofs, expanding to approximately 88 million pounds in 1986.The formulation percentages of PlR/PU foam-in-place are basically 40 percentisocyanate to 40 percent polyol to 20 percent blowing agent and other ingredients.Unlike boardstock, where the ingredients are mixed as they are used, PIR/PUfoam-in-place is premixed and sold to installers in drums. Shelf-life ofsix months is the industry standard. According to the industry, formulationswith more than 30 percent polyester in the polyol fraction break down inless than six months, and viscosity is seriously impaired. Polyol is the component in all types of PIR/PU rigid foam insulation thatcan contain recovered materials. ASTM defines polyol in cellular plasticusage to ``include compounds containing alcoholic hydroxyl groups suchas polyethers, glycols, polyesters, and castor oil used in urethane foam.''Industry sources have stated that the foam insulation market for polyolis approximately 100 million to 120 million pounds per year. Two typesof polyol are used by the PIR/PU industry, aromatic polyester polyol andpolyether polyol: <T3>Aromatic polyester polyol </T3>can be derived from recycled pre- andpostconsumer PET or from the chemicals DMT and phthalic anhydride. Thepolyol is made by reacting glycol with the other ingredients. In some cases,waste DMT bottoms are used; phthalic anhydride bottoms are possibly usedas well. Various manufacturers contacted between 1986 and 1988 suggestedthat DMT bottoms and possibly phthalic anhydride bottoms were commonlyrecovered to produce feedstock resins for plastic rigid foam insulationproducts. PET polyols are 45 percent PET to 55 percent glycol. DMT polyolsare 50 percent DMT to 50 percent glycol. <T3>Polyether polyol </T3>is derived from polypropylene oxide, a virginmaterial process. The insulation industry has switched almost entirelyfrom polyether polyols to the less expensive polyester polyols for boardstock.Premixed foam-in-place insulation uses about 70 percent polyether and 30percent polyester to avoid loss of viscosity in storage. At least one company is marketing polyols made from both postconsumer andmanufacturing waste PET bottles as well as x-ray and other films. Othercompanies are marketing polyols derived from chemical bottoms.Twenty manufacturers of PIR/PU board have been identified with productionfacilities in 36 locations. Distribution across the country is fairly goodin the northwest and mid-northern states. Although it was not determinedhow many of these insulation manufacturers use polyols derived from recoveredmaterials, nor exactly how many polyol producers are using recovered materialsrather than virgin feedstocks, one third of the polyols currently marketedfor PIR/PU rigid foam insulation are said to be derived from recoveredmaterials. b. <T3>Glass fiber reinforced PIR/PU foam. </T3>A special type of PIR/PU boardis reinforced with glass fibers and is designed to improve fire retardancy.The feedstocks are similar to the other types of PIR/PU foams but the formulationratio differs. More isocyanate is used in relation to aromatic polyesterpolyol. The formulation ratios are 15 percent polyol, 67 percent isocyanateand 18 percent fiberglass, blowing agents, surfactants and catalysts. Thisproduct is produced by only one company to date which may or may not limitavailability. c. <T3>Polystyrene insulation. </T3>Polystyrene insulation for building constructionis produced by two processes. Expanded polystyrene foams incorporate ablowing agent, usually pentane, with polystyrene beads which are expandedwith steam or hot air. The resulting ``prepuff'' is aged for six to twenty-fourhours before the final product is made in a heated mold. The product isthen cooled in the mold to assure uniformity and good quality. Extruded polystyrene is made by combining polystyrene base resin with ablowing agent in one extruder, feeding the melt through a cooling extruderthen through a die for the desired shape. Flame retardants are also addedto the product mix. Like the PIR/PU foams, blowing agents are generallyretained within the cellular structure to improve R-values. Representatives from several manufacturers of polystyrene insulation indicatedthat use of recovered material content is technically feasible. However,one source stated that polystyrene with flame retardants could not be reused,which would appear to restrict the use of home scrap in polystyrene insulationmanufacture. Despite indications that research and development effortsmay be underway, current use of recovered materials could not be documented.EPA identified 77 manufacturers of polystyrene insulation. These includeproducers of both extruded polystyrene and expanded polystyrene products.Numerous other small companies are said to be in business around the country.Geographically, the identified polystyrene insulation manufacturers arespread as widely as the producers of other types of insulation products.d. <T3>Phenolic insulation. </T3>Phenolic rigid foam insulation is said tohave very high R-values per inch, good fire retardation, and potentiallylow cost, among other characteristics. It is a fairly new product, butthe relative market share is expected to grow rapidly from its currentsmall base. Phenolic foam production is similar to PIR/PU foam, althoughthe ingredients differ. Aromatic polyester polyols are used in small quantitiesas a plasticizer. The product formulations vary according to the specificproduct. Product mixes are also guarded competitive secrets because theproduct is new. Therefore, the following list of ingredients do not addto 100 percent. andbullet; Phenolic resin_65%-85%. andbullet; Blowing agent_5%-15%. andbullet; Catalyst and surfactants_5.5%-21.5%. andbullet; Polyester polyol_3%-10%. Unlike the approximate 1 to 1 ratio of glycol to other ingredients in PIR/PUpolyols, aromatic polyester polyol in phenolic foam manufacture uses 10percent glycol to other ingredients. The 90 percent fraction of the polyolcontains the recovered material. However, one manufacturer stated thatlarger percentages of polyol used as a plasticizer produce an end productthat is too soft for commercial application with mechanized roofing equipment,and therefore a higher percentage of recovered material is technicallyimpracticable. Few manufacturers of phenolic foam were identified by EPA. A commenterinformed EPA that the phenolic foam also is available under four privatelabel and joint venture agreements with the principal manufacturer. Thisis the only limit on availability for government procurement. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Rock Wool </ITAG>Rock wool is used as loose-fill insulation and also is sold in batts andblankets, although production of batts and blankets is phasing out. Whilerock wool and fiberglass insulation manufacturers are not necessarily thesame companies, they all belong to the same trade associations and thetwo products are usually tracked together under the general  heading mineralfibers. Rock wool insulation is most frequently made from metallurgical slag, suchas slag from steel mills. Approximately 70 percent of the rock wool producedin 1980 was primarily made from blast furnace slag, the other 30 percentwas primarily made from steel and copper slag. Not all rock wool manufacturersdepend entirely on slag for their feedstock needs, however. Some use traprock or basaltic rock. Use of slag or alternatives depends on the availabilityand costs of the materials and their location to production facilities.The rock wool industry is shrinking, and data is no longer consistentlygathered. However, conversations with manufacturers in 1988 indicated thatmore companies are using higher percentages of natural rock than were in1980. Natural rock is said to have a lower comparative yield. Slag has a highermelting alumina silicate than natural rock, which makes slag-based insulationattractive in commercial and residential installations where fire protectionis important. For comparative purposes, fiberglass is affected by heatat 1,200-1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to rock wool, where temperaturesmust exceed 1,800-2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the wool is affected.There are no sources of postconsumer recovered material for rock wool insulation.The manufacture of this type of insulation is linked to the metal smeltingindustries, which provide the principal feedstocks. Smelting in the UnitedStates is decreasing, and there is strong demand for metallurgical slagsas aggregate substitutes in asphalt and concrete for road construction.Slag for rock wool must be of higher quality and contain fewer contaminantsthan slag for substitute aggregates. Although rock wool manufacturers aresaid to pay premium prices, some slag suppliers are said to prefer volumeto specialty customers. Some rock wool manufacturers have also begun to use spent aluminum potlineras a fuel substitute and fluoride source. The potliner replaces a portionof the more expensive coke used as fuel to melt the slag or rock. The proportionsare determined by chemical composition of the slag. The fluoride in thespent potliner serves as a flux and also improves the viscosity of themolten material which, in turn, improves the fiber spinning process. Inaddition, potliner has very low sulfur content which reduces sulfur instack emissions. Rock wool insulation's market share has been decreasing in recent years.One estimate based on data gathered in 1985 was 9-10 percent of the totalmarket; the percentage dropped to 3 percent in another estimate in 1987.Changes in the industry and in trade associations have made it difficultto make a more accurate assessment. The most recent data cited was for1982, when U.S. production of rock wool was estimated to be 1.0 billionpounds (453,500 metric tons). Ten manufacturers of rock wool insulationwere identified, with plants in 18 locations. Trade association representativesstated that a number of small companies do not belong to the associationsand therefore may not be included in this total. Rock wool insulation manufacturersare primarily located in the mid-west and the southern states, with a fewcompanies located in the northeast. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Conclusions </ITAG>EPA concludes that six of the principal insulation products used in theUnited States are commercially available with recovered materials content:Cellulose, fiberboard made with cellulose, perlite composite boards, PIR/PUrigid foam, phenolic rigid foam, and rock wool. A specialty product, glassfiber reinforced PIR/PU rigid foam, also uses recovered materials. Industrysources have suggested that polystyrene insulation containing recoveredmaterials is technically feasible; however, commercial use has not yetbegun. EPA further concludes that the technology exists to manufacture fiberglassinsulation using preconsumer cullet and possibly postconsumer bottle cullet.For a variety of reasons, however, no American fiberglass manufacturingplant routinely uses either pre- or postconsumer bottle cullet. Based on the evidence reviewed above, EPA notes that insulation meetinga wide range of construction design applications is available with recoveredmaterials content. EPA did not evaluate the potential for recovered materialsusage in specialty types of insulation made with virgin materials becausethey represent such a small portion of the insulation market. D. Federal Purchasing Power The fourth EPA criterion for selection of a procurement item for affirmativeprocurement under RCRA Section 6002 is that the Federal government's abilityto affect purchasing or use of the item, when it contains recovered materials,be substantial. The dollar volume of the building insulation industry was estimated byHull andamp; Company in 1986 to be $2.24 billion excluding retrofit of residentialbuildings. A.W. Johnson estimated the 1986 residential retrofit insulationmarket to be $6.7 million. The total 1986 building insulation market, atmanufacturer's net price is estimated to be $2.9 billion. Other industryspokesmen estimated the total market to be $3 billion in 1985. The samesources stated that the industry was holding even, with neither major growthnor shrinkage. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Federal Government </ITAG>Government agencies purchase, or finance purchases with appropriated Federalfunds, residential, industrial, and commercial types of insulation products.Expenditures for insulation purchased with appropriated Federal dollarsis conservatively estimated to be $148 million. This figure representsonly those expenditures that could be estimated based on assured insulationuse by an agency. Open market expenditures at the local level may be considerablebut could not be estimated because centralized records are not currentlymaintained. Based on 1986 estimates of market size and identified governmentpurchases, the Federal government accounts for approximately 5.1 percentof the insulation market. Procurements by individual agencies are summarizedin Table 5.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 5._<T4>Summary of Estimated Government Expenditures for Insulation</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><T3>Department of Energy </T3>(1985):<ITAG tagnum="3">Weatherization </ITAG><D>$38,000,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Institutional Conservation </ITAG><D>4,593,000</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="4">Total DOE <D>42,593,000</D><R/></ITAG><T3>Health andamp; Human Services </T3>(1985):<ITAG tagnum="3"> Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program </ITAG><D>45,750,000</D><R/><T3>Housing and Urban Development </T3>(1986):<ITAG tagnum="3">Public Housing Modernization Fund </ITAG><D>14,000,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Housing for Elderly and Handicapped </ITAG><D>3,800,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Community Development Block Grants </ITAG><D>5,700,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Indian Housing Program </ITAG><D>2,392,000</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="4">Total HUD <D>25,892,000</D><R/></ITAG><T3>General Services Administration </T3>(1986):<ITAG tagnum="3">Direct purchases </ITAG><D>487,300</D><ITAG tagnum="3"> New construction, repairs, and alterations </ITAG><D>12,344,600</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="4">Total GSA <D>12,831,900</D><R/></ITAG><T3>Department of Defense </T3>(1986):<ITAG tagnum="3">Direct purchases </ITAG><D>Nominal</D><ITAG tagnum="3">New construction and rehabilitation </ITAG><D>20,983,600</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="4"><T3>Total Estimated Government Purchases </T3><D>148,050,500</D></ITAG></ITAG>The value of Federal insulation purchases was estimated as conservativelyas possible, using lowest percentages or lowest range when there was achoice. It is probable that appropriated Federal dollars account for aconsiderably higher percentage of market share. Insulation is rarely trackedas a line item in any budget. In the one case that EPA knows of, the dataare not yet available.The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that 20 percent of its expendituresfor the Weatherization Program is spent for insulation. Funds are distributedthrough state agencies, which in turn use a variety of methods to distributemonies through local housing authorities and local grantees. The InstitutionalConservation program roughly estimated total insulation expenditures fromwhich an average annual expenditure was computed.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) distributes Low IncomeHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds. Under this program, statesare allowed to spend up to 15 percent of their allocation on weatherization.As these funds are distributed by the same state agencies as DOE funds,the same 20 percent estimate for insulation was used.Many Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs providefunds for building construction and/or rehabilitation. Insulation expendituresare not tracked at the national level. HUD funds are distributed many ways,for instance through the ten regional HUD offices, through local housingauthorities or through block grants to states where priorities are determinedlocally. Most HUD funds that are dispersed where they could be used topurchase insulation are considered loans. However, loans are repaid throughFederal funds and subsidies, not from the private sector. In addition,HUD mortgage insurance programs range from $30 to $100 billion per year,and energy efficiency remains a high priority. The insulation componentwould be $228 to $760 million. This estimate derived from mortgage insurancewas not included in the estimate of Federal purchases of insulation becauseit could not be established that direct or indirect expenditures of appropriatedFederal funds actually take place in insurance programs.At the General Services Administration (GSA), insulation is purchased directlyfor use by government agencies and is also purchased through constructioncontracts. The entire direct purchase program is being revised from warehousedpurchases to requirement contracts which allow agencies to buy what theyneed directly from suppliers under annual contract. Direct expenditureswere determined as available. All GSA expenditures for insulation are directuse of Federal funds.Divisions of the Department of Defense (DOD), the Army, Navy and the AirForce, do not track direct purchases of insulation. Construction projectswhich would include insulation were estimated from the general constructionbudget (which includes non-insulated items like bridges). All DOD expendituresfor insulation are direct use of Federal funds.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Impact on State and Local Governments</ITAG>A significant number of the Federal programs disperse their funds throughstate, local and non-profit agencies. Funds are not specifically earmarkedfor insulation purchases; rather monies are used for weatherization, buildingconstruction, rehabilitation and so on, usually through construction contracts.State and local agencies are required to comply with EPA procurement guidelinesunder the conditions described in Section IV.C. of this preamble. EPA believesthat once affirmative procurement programs are established by state andlocal agencies in compliance with their obligations when using Federalfunds, the same provisions that favor the use of recovered material contentwill be used for other insulation purchases.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Conclusions</ITAG>EPA concludes that the expenditure of Federal funds for insulation wouldhave a significant impact on the insulation market. EPA believes not onlythat direct Federal government agency purchases would have an impact, butalso that a considerable ripple effect would develop through state andlocal governments that use local funds as well as Federal funds for majorprograms.E. Other ConsiderationsThere is an additional factor affecting insulation which EPA included inits development of the guideline issued today. Both pre- and postconsumerwaste materials (e.g., newspaper, glass, plastic) and industrial byproducts(e.g., slag, chemical bottoms, potliner) are used in many different typesof building insulation products. All these products compete for the sameend use. Although most byproducts and some pre-consumer materials usedin building insulation are not currently a solid waste management problem,EPA is concerned that these materials could return to the waste streamif preferences were established for products made with only a few pre-and postconsumer materials. Therefore, EPA has intentionally included withinthe scope of the guideline insulation products made with all pre-consumermaterials and industrial byproducts that qualify as recovered materialsunder the RCRA definition.In the proposed guideline, EPA requested comments on including this rangeof recovered materials for insulation products in the scope. No commentschallenged the basic conclusion. In fact, only the use of glass culletin fiberglass insulation was addressed in the comments received. A fiberglass manufacturer recommended that EPA state unequivocally thatonly postconsumer cullet be addressed because preconsumer cullet is nota significant solid waste management problem. EPA disagrees. In some partsof the country where preconsumer plate glass cullet was previously soldto the glass container industry, it has become more difficult to find buyers.Therefore, there is a potential solid waste management problem. A fiberglass trade association commented that EPA should recognize thesuccessful use of internal scrap (``re-feed'') as ``a responsible activityin response to the spirit and intent of RCRA'' by including it as recycledcontent in fiberglass. EPA again disagrees. The RCRA definition of recoveredmaterials specifically excludes ``material and by-products generated from,and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process.'' Thus,while EPA encourages this type of recycling, ``re-feed'' materials usedin fiberglass manufacture do not qualify as recovered materials for purposesof RCRA. A recycling center commented that additional markets (such as fiberglass)are needed for mixed-color postconsumer cullet because prices in Californiadropped to $0 per ton in September 1988. EPA agrees in principal but cannotcurrently recommend a minimum content standard for fiberglass (as discussedin Section IV.G.1.d. of the preamble). EPA sought information from culletbrokers and recycling operations around the country regarding unsold suppliesof postconsumer cullet. Not one indicated a current or future concern withselling current and potential supplies of clean, color-sorted bottle cullet.F. Conclusions Regarding the Designation of Building Insulation ProductsBased on the analysis above and comments received on the proposed guideline,including economic and environmental considerations, EPA has determinedthat building insulation products containing ``recovered materials'' asdefined by RCRA meet the criteria for designation as a procurement itemunder the provisions of section 6002. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Contents of the Guideline </ITAG>This portion of the preamble explains each section of the final guideline,including EPA's response to comments. Of the comments EPA received on theproposed guideline, half simply expressed support based on the need formarkets for recyclable materials or primarily urged EPA to maximize theuse of recovered materials in insulation products. Although the remainingcomments recommended various improvements which are addressed in the relevantsections, no commenters advised against issuing the guideline. A. Purposes The purposes of this guideline are (1) to designate building insulationproducts, as described below, as items subject to the procurement requirementsof section 6002 of RCRA; and (2) to recommend procedures for complyingwith section 6002. Insulation products are not fungible items and consequently do not competein the marketplace on the basis of price alone. Technical performance considerationsmay dictate use of one type of insulation material rather than another.EPA believes that the intent of RCRA would best be served by identifyingand increasing the use of recovered materials content in as many differenttypes of insulation products as possible. Competition between product type(e.g., loose-fill, blanket, board, or spray-in-place) or material type(e.g., cellulose, fiberglass, rock wool, rigid plastic foam, and specialtymaterials) would therefore continue, while use of recovered materials wouldincrease. Consequently, EPA has sought to include all the major types ofinsulation in commercial use within the final guideline. EPA received severalfavorable comments and no negative comments on this approach. B. Scope This guideline applies to building insulation products. This term includesbut is not limited to insulation products used in residential, commercial,and industrial type applications and includes blanket, board, spray-in-place,and loose-fill insulations. As explained in section II.D. of this preamble,building insulation is used in four locations: ceilings, floors, foundations,and walls. The types of materials from which these products are made include,but are not limited to, cellulose fiber, fiberglass, rock wool, plasticrigid foams, and specialty materials. Composite products made from morethan one material are also included within the scope of this guideline.All of the predominant application types of building insulation are includedwithin the scope of the guideline, and all contain, or have the technicalpotential to contain, recovered materials. In addition, specialty materialsfor all types of building insulation or insulation ingredients where recoveredmaterial content use may not have been documented (e.g., vermiculite andpolystyrene) <T3>are </T3>included within the scope of this guideline. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Facers and Bindings </ITAG>In this guideline, recommendations for minimum content standards and anyreferences to recovered material content refer only to the core materialof an insulation product and do not include any facings, bindings, or othermaterials applied to the surfaces of the core materials. In the case ofcomposite products made from more than one material, proposed minimum contentstandards apply to the respective materials used in the core unless theproduct is specifically addressed. Several commenters questioned the decision to exclude facers, binders,and other materials applied to core materials on the basis that they couldcontain recovered materials. Examples include asphalt saturated felt, fibrousglass, aluminum foil and sheet, vinyl (various thicknesses, formulationsand reinforcements), cork, burlap, laminates of aluminum, paper and variouspolymers, kraft paper, vinyl reinforced kraft, woven mesh, woven and non-wovenorganic and non-organic mats, glass fiber mats, latex coatings, neoprenecoatings, and a wide variety of water base and hot-melt adhesives. Theseapplied materials can be and are used in a wide range of combinations;they are often laminated in four or more variations depending on the finalproduct specifications, and any or all of the applied materials can beused with all the different core materials. This diversity makes it difficult for EPA to recommend meaningful minimumcontent standards and could discourage purchasing officials from usingproducts containing recovered materials. Thus, the probability of increasingrecovered material use in these applied materials is significantly outweighedby the probability that complex minimum content standards would discouragecompliance with the guideline. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Postconsumer Recovered Paper </ITAG>EPA has included insulation made with postconsumer recovered paper in thescope of this guideline, as well as stressed its use in building insulationproducts. Section 501 of HSWA amended RCRA section 6002(c)(1) to stressthe maximum practicable use, in the case of paper, of postconsumer recoveredmaterials. These postconsumer paper materials are defined in RCRA section6002(h) as:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Paper, paperboard, and fibrous wastes from retail stores, officebuildings, homes, and so forth, after they have passed through their end-usageas a consumer item, including: used corrugated boxes, old newspapers, oldmagazines, mixed waste paper, tabulating cards, and used cordage, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) All paper, paperboard, and fibrous wastes that enter and are collectedfrom municipal solid waste.</ITAG>EPA believes that increasing the use of postconsumer recovered paper isa key goal of RCRA section 6002. Therefore, EPA is recommending minimumpostconsumer recovered paper content standards for those insulation productswhich are capable of being made with paper fibers. (As previously discussed,EPA is not including fiberboard in the final guideline issued today althoughsome manufacturers use postconsumer recovered paper to produce fiberboards.Instead, EPA will continue to consider various issues pertaining to fiberboards,including whether a minimum content standard for postconsumer recoveredpaper for fiberboard would have a positive net impact on solid waste volumes.)<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Other Types of Insulating Products </ITAG>There are other types of insulating products, such as air handling, acoustic,pipe, and cold storage insulation. Building insulation was designated becauseit is by far the largest volume of insulation manufactured, is least likelyto require virgin specialty materials for specialty purposes, and is dominatedby the types of insulation products that for physical or chemical reasonscan contain recovered materials. Government purchases of insulation productswould also tend to have the greatest impact on this category. These other types of insulation products must meet different and frequentlymore stringent specifications and are believed to be less easily adaptedto manufacture with recovered materials. EPA requested comments on theuse of recovered materials in non-building types of insulation and whetherthey should be included in this guideline. Several commenters recommendedthat EPA investigate the feasibility of including these products withinthe scope of the guideline but offered no details. Another stated thatthese products should not be included because they do not meet the definitionof ``building insulation.'' Another commenter stated they should not beincluded because they must meet unique specifications, they are often usedin applications where they are required to give structural support, resistanceto flaking or fiber erosion, and acoustical insulation. EPA acknowledgesthat these products deserve further study and therefore is not includingthem within the scope of the guideline issued today. C. Applicability Many of the requirements of section 6002 apply to ``procuring agencies,''which is defined in RCRA section 1004(17) as ``any Federal agency, or anyState agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is usingappropriated Federal funds for such procurement, or any person contractingwith any such agency with respect to work performed under such contract.''Under section 6002(a), the procurement requirements apply to any purchaseby a procuring agency of an item costing more than $10,000 or when theprocuring agency purchased $10,000 worth of the item or of functionallyequivalent items during the preceding fiscal year. Both direct and indirectpurchases are covered.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Procuring Agencies </ITAG>In its other procurement guidelines, EPA discussed the applicability ofsection 6002 to procuring agencies. Because this discussion is germaneto this guideline as well, EPA is including it in the final guideline today.The statutory definition of procuring agency identifies three types ofagencies: (1) Federal agencies, (2) State or local agencies using appropriatedFederal funds, and (3) contractors. Federal agencies should note that underthis definition, the requirements of section 6002 apply to them whetheror not <T3>appropriated </T3>Federal funds are used for procurement of items designatedby EPA. Section 248.3(a)(2) has been added to the final guideline to clarifythis point. In addition, the requirements of section 6002 apply to each Federal agencyas a whole. This point is particularly important in determining whetherthe $10,000 threshold has been reached. For example, the Department ofHousing and Urban Development (HUD) as a whole, purchases, or causes thepurchase of, more than $10,000 worth of building insulation products duringeach fiscal year. Therefore, the requirements of section 6002 will applyto all procurements of building insulation products by HUD, its regions,and subagencies. One commenter stated that EPA should make it clear that section 6002 requirementsapply to private contractors as well as to government purchasing agencies.EPA agrees. The statutory definition of procuring agencies includes anyperson contracting with the defined Federal, state, or local agencies.Clearly, contractors must comply with the guideline when installing insulationon projects for Federal agencies or for state and local agencies whereappropriated Federal funds are used. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Direct Purchases </ITAG>For the purposes of this guideline, purchases made as a result of a solicitationby a procuring agency for its own general use or that of other agencies(for example, GSA purchases) are considered ``direct.'' Building insulationpurchased as part of a construction contract is also considered a ``directpurchase.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Indirect Purchases </ITAG>The definition of ``procuring agency'' in RCRA section 1004(17) makes itclear that the requirements of section 6002 apply to ``indirect purchases,''i.e., purchases by a State or local agency using appropriated Federal fundsor, in some instances, its contractors. Thus, the guideline may apply tobuilding insulation purchases meeting the $10,000 threshold made by States,political subdivisions of states, or their contractors. In the proposed guideline, EPA stated that the guideline does not applyto such purchases if they are unrelated to or incidental to the Federalfunding, i.e., not the direct result of the grant, loan, or funds disbursement.Several commenters disagreed with EPA's interpretation, noting that RCRAsection 6002(a) states simply that section 6002 applies to ``<T3>any </T3>purchase or acquisition of a procurement item'' (emphasisadded) when the $10,000 threshold is reached. These commenters raise anissue of general applicability to all the procurement guidelines. The Agencyplans further review and consideration of this issue and will publish detailedguidance on this subject within the near term. However, at this time, EPAis retaining the proposed language, which provided that the guideline doesnot apply to purchases that are not the direct result of a funds disbursementto a procuring agency. EPA requested comments on whether this guideline should exempt block grantsfrom the section 6002 procurement requirements or exempt block grants onlywhen it is not possible to account separately for such funds. Commentersstated that there should not be an exemption, which would circumvent theintent of section 6002. EPA agrees and therefore, there is no exemptionfor block grants in the final guideline. EPA believes that the guidelineshould apply whenever Federal monies, including block grants, are used,whether or not they are commingled with non-Federal funds. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. The $10,000 Threshold </ITAG>RCRA section 6002(a) provides that the requirements of section 6002 apply:(1) When the purchase price of an item exceeds $10,000 or (2) when thequantity of such items or of functionally equivalent items purchased duringthe preceding fiscal year was $10,000 or more. Thus, section 6002 clearlysets out a two-step procedure for determining whether the $10,000 thresholdhas been reached. First, a procuring agency must determine whether it purchased$10,000 worth of building insulation products during the preceding fiscalyear. If so, the requirements of section 6002 apply to all building insulationpurchases occurring in the current fiscal year. Second, if a procuringagency did not procure $10,000 worth of building insulation products duringthe preceding fiscal year, it is not subject to section 6002 unless itmakes a purchase of building insulation products, during the current fiscalyear, exceeding $10,000. The requirements of section 6002 then apply tothe $10,000 purchase of building insulation products; to all subsequentpurchases of building insulation products made during the current fiscalyear, regardless of size; and to all procurements of building insulationproducts made in the following fiscal year. Section 6002(a) does not provide that the procurement requirements aretriggered when the quantity of items purchased during the <T3>current </T3>fiscal year is $10,000 or more. EPA does not believe thatCongress intended to require procuring agencies to keep a running tallyof procurements of items designated by EPA. Maintaining such a runningtally would be very burdensome. Rather, procuring agencies only need tocompute their total procurements of building insulation products once atthe end of the fiscal year and only if they intend to claim an exemptionfrom the requirements of section 6002 in the following fiscal year. Note that the text of andSection; 248.3(a)(1) in the final guideline differsslightly from the proposed text. The proposed text did not reflect thestatutory provision that section 6002 applies when an agency makes a purchaseexceeding $10,000 in the current year. The text in the final guidelinehas been corrected accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Functionally Equivalent Items </ITAG>In common usage, the term ``insulation'' covers many items manufacturedto meet different uses and performance standards. EPA believes that restrictingthe applicability of section 6002 based on a very narrow, technical definitionof functional equivalency would limit the effectiveness of the guidelinein meeting the objectives of RCRA, because an agency may purchase lessthan $10,000 of each type of building insulation product. EPA has concluded that, in the case of building insulation, ``functionallyequivalent'' items should be defined as a category of items having substantiallythe same or similar end use. This category, ``building insulation,'' willassure broad applicability of this guideline. Further, building insulationtypes defined by design (such as loose-fill, blanket, board, and spray-in-place)and building insulation products defined by material content (such as fiberglass,cellulose, rock wool, plastic rigid foams, composites, and specialty materials)can be used almost interchangeably in ceilings, floors, foundations andwalls. The choice of building insulation type and material content is basedon technical considerations that are site specific. Government procuring agencies rarely track building insulation purchasesas a line item and certainly do not distinguish between material typesor design types of building insulation products. EPA believes that theguideline will be more easily implemented by procuring agencies if alltypes of insulation used to resist heat flow within a building are includedwithin the single category of building insulation. Under andSection; 248.3(a)(1) of the guideline, all of the following typesof insulation are encompassed by the term ``building insulation'' and thereforeare ``functionally equivalent'' for purposes of the $10,000 threshold:andbullet; Loose-fill insulation, including but not limited to cellulosefiber, fiberglass, rock wool, vermiculite, and perlite; andbullet; Blanket and batt insulation, including but not limited to fiberglassand rock wool; andbullet; Board (sheathing, roof decking, wall panel) insulation, includingbut not limited to cellulose fiber fiberboard, perlite composite board,glass fiberboard, foam glass, perlite, polyurethane, polyisocyanurate,polystyrene, phenolics, and composites; and andbullet; Spray-in-place insulation, including but not limited to polyurethane,polyisocyanurate and spray-on cellulose.  <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Miscellaneous Comments </ITAG>A commenter strongly supported EPA's position that the $10,000 thresholdapplies to each Federal agency as a whole (andSection; 248.3(a)(3)) and toall types of building insulation as ``functionally equivalent items'' (andSection;248.2(a)(2)). D. Definitions Most of the definitions used in the final guideline are used in RCRA andtherefore need no further explanation. Others are standard industry orpurchasing definitions. A few are discussed in more detail in this sectionof the preamble to clarify the information that follows. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Practicable </ITAG>Section 6002 requires procuring agencies to procure items composed of thehighest percentage of recovered materials <T3>practicable </T3>and to develop programs to assure that recovered materialsare purchased to the maximum extent <T3>practicable </T3>(emphasis added). EPA defined the term ``practicable''in the final paper guideline, 52 FR 37297 (October 6, 1987) and is includingthe definition in the final guideline issued today. EPA's definition of ``practicable'' combines the dictionary definitionwith certain statutory criteria for determining practicability. The dictionarydefinition of practicable is ``capable of being used,'' and EPA believesthat Congress intended the term to be defined in this way. Congress alsoprovided four criteria for determining the maximum amount practicable:(1) Performance in accordance with applicable specifications; (2) availabilityat a reasonable price; (3) availability within a reasonable period of time;and (4) maintenance of a satisfactory level of competition. EPA's definitionof ``practicable'' incorporates these criteria.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Building Insulation</ITAG>``Building insulation'' is defined as a material, primarily designed toresist heat flow, which is installed between the conditioned (heated and/ormechanically cooled) volume of a building and adjacent, unconditioned volumesor the outside. This term includes but is not limited to insulation productssuch as blanket, board, spray-in-place, and loose-fill. ``Building insulation''is intended to cover all thermal insulation products used in all typesof structures with the exception of cold storage and pipe insulation. Thephrase ``including but not limited to'' in the insulation definitions isintended to insure that new types of products will be included within thescope of the guideline as they are developed. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Procurement Terms </ITAG>To simplify the Federal purchasing process, ``commercial item descriptions''(CIDs), which reference industry standards, have generally replaced themultitude of individual insulation specifications previously used by Federalprocuring agencies. In issuing procurement solicitations, procuring agenciescan stipulate special terms and conditions (such as minimum content standardsfor recovered material content), in the ``invitation to bid'' or ``requestfor proposal'' documents. These phrases have been defined by the NationalInstitute of Governmental Purchasing as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>``Commercial Item Descriptions'' </T3>are series of simplified itemdescriptions under the Federal specifications-and-standards program usedin the acquisition of commercial off-the-shelf and commercial type products.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>``Invitation For Bids (IFB)'' </T3>is the solicitation for prospectivesuppliers by a purchaser requesting their competitive price quotations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>``Request for Proposal (RFP)'' </T3>is a request for an offer by oneparty to another of terms and conditions with references to some work orundertaking; the initial overture or preliminary statement for considerationby the other party to a proposed agreement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">4. Insulation Terms </ITAG>Definitions for terms relating to insulation are directly quoted or havebeen adapted from the Association of Testing and Materials (ASTM), theDepartment of Energy's Residential Conservation Service definitions, andFederal specifications, as they were available. When necessary, EPA hasdeveloped terms and definitions for purposes of this guideline. EPA requested comments on the term and definition ``cellulose fiberboard,''and whether the industry term ``cellulosic fiberboard'' referred to fiberboardscontaining postconsumer recovered paper. Responses were inconclusive. EPAhas determined that fiberboards made with postconsumer recovered newspaperare covered by the term cellulosic fiberboard but related products madewith laminations derived from pre- and postconsumer corrugated are not.EPA will re-examine the term and definition. E. Requirements vs. Recommendations RCRA section 6002 requires procuring agencies and contracting officersto perform certain activities, such as revising specifications for procurementitems. It also requires EPA to prepare ``guidelines for the use of procuringagencies in complying with'' section 6002. EPA has incorporated the section6002 requirements into the final guideline for the benefit of procuringagencies. As a result, the guideline contains two types of provisions:requirements (mandated by Congress in section 6002) and recommendations(EPA's guidance for complying with the requirements of section 6002). Asused in this guideline, the verbs ``shall'' and ``must'' indicate section6002 requirements, while verbs such as ``recommend,'' ``should,'' and ``suggest''indicate recommendations for complying with those requirements. Procuring agencies must comply with the requirements of section 6002, whereasEPA's recommendations are only advisory in nature. Procuring agencies maychoose to use other approaches which satisfy the section 6002 requirements.However, EPA believes that if a procuring agency chooses to follow EPA'srecommendations, that agency will be in compliance with the section 6002requirements. F. Specifications Subpart B of the guideline, Specifications, contains two sections, Revisionsand Recommendations. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Revisions </ITAG>a. <T3>Federal agencies. </T3>RCRA section 6002(d) contains two requirementsfor revising specifications for procurement items. First, Federal agenciesthat have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications forprocurement items procured by Federal agencies were required to revisetheir specifications, by May 8, 1986, to eliminate exclusions of recoveredmaterials and requirements that items be manufactured from virgin materials(section 6002(d)(1)). Second, within one year after the date of publication of a guideline asa final rule, Federal agencies must assure that their specifications fordesignated items require the use of recovered materials to the maximumextent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item (section6002(d)(2)). EPA believes that this second requirement is more extensivethan the first requirement. Simply eliminating discriminatory provisions,as required by section 6002(d)(1), is not sufficient to meet all the obligationsof section 6002(d). EPA believes, however, that compliance with the affirmativeprocurement requirements of section 6002(i) fulfills the section 6002(d)(2)requirements because an affirmative procurement program should result inprocurement of building insulation products containing recovered materialsto the maximum extent practicable. b. <T3>Procuring agencies. </T3>Non-Federal procuring agencies will also berequired to revise their specifications for building insulation products.These agencies are required, by section 6002(c)(1) of the Act, to procurebuilding insulation products composed of the highest percentage of recoveredmaterials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory levelof competition. Section 6002(c)(1) requires that any decision not to purchasebuilding insulation products composed of the highest percentage of recoveredmaterials practicable be based on a determination that such products (1)are not available within a reasonable period of time, (2) are not availableat a reasonable price, or (3) fail to meet reasonable performance standardsset forth in the applicable specifications. Under section 6002(c)(1), a procuring agency cannot choose to purchasebuilding insulation products produced with virgin material simply becausethe agency's existing specifications for building insulation products requirethe use of virgin materials or prohibit the use of recovered materials.To be consistent with the requirements of the Act, any such discriminationin an agency's specifications must relate directly to an inability of thebuilding insulation to satisfy reasonable, established performance requirements.Consequently, any procuring agency that now uses a specification that precludesthe use of recovered materials in building insulation products must reviseits building insulation specifications to eliminate that discriminatoryprovision. In previously issued guidelines, EPA addressed the obligation of non-Federalprocuring agencies to revise their specifications as a requirement of section6002(d)(2). That section, by its terms, applies only to Federal agencies.EPA believes, however, that the requirements imposed upon non-Federal procuringagencies by section 6002(c)(1) of the Act are co-extensive with the requirementsplaced upon Federal procuring agencies by section 6002(d)(2). Accordingly,in previous guidelines, EPA drew no distinction between Federal and non-Federalagencies as concerns the statutory sources of the requirement that discriminatoryspecifications be revised. The distinction is drawn at this time not toindicate a change in the EPA's position, but to answer concerns that theAgency's prior discussion of section 6002(d)(2) may be construed as anunjustifiable expansion of the applicability of that section. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Recommendations </ITAG>In the early 1980s, the Federal government began to use CIDs for insulationpurchases, as they are available, rather than specifications written byeach individual agency. CIDs are functional in nature and as generic aspossible to permit the maximum number of suppliers to bid for contracts.In general, ASTM and ASHRAE specifications are referenced. EPA has reviewed the materials requirements of the ASTM specificationsand finds that they neither allow nor disallow recovered material content.ASHRAE specifications tend to be test and performance standards and thusdo not refer to specific material content. EPA has also reviewed specificationsused by Federal agencies. HUD programs list certain Federal specificationsand reference minimum property standards, which currently refer to localbuilding codes. Local building codes reference the ASTM and ASHRAE specifications.DOE weatherization program specifications that deal with material contentrequire conformance with equivalent ASTM specifications. GSA referencedASTM and DOD military specifications and commercial item descriptions in1986 procurements. The military specifications address the issue of recycled content in oneof two ways, depending on the specification. Either recycled content wasneither allowed nor disallowed in the material description or there wasa special clause requiring that recovered materials be used to the maximumextent practicable. Recovered materials was defined to mean ``materialswhich have been collected or recovered from solid waste and reprocessedto become a source of raw materials as opposed to virgin raw materials.None of the above shall be interpreted to mean that the use of used orrebuilt products is allowed.''As previously discussed, all procuring agencies must assure that theirspecifications for items designated by EPA are revised, as necessary, toallow the use of recovered materials to the maximum extent practicable.If the use of CIDs and standard specifications over which procuring agencieshave no direct control continues, another method to assure maximum useof recovered material content in building insulation products must be employed.a. <T3>Use of commercial item descriptions. </T3>EPA believes that the useof industry standards and CIDs is an efficient procurement practice andtherefore recommends in andSection; 248.11(a) of the final guideline thatCommercial Item Descriptions and equivalent standards continue to be usedwhenever possible. However, the use of CIDs and industry standards doesnot absolve procuring agencies of the requirement to review specificationsto assure that recovered materials are used to the maximum extent possiblewithout jeopardizing the end use of the item. As CIDs or industry standardsare adopted, procuring agencies must review them thoroughly to be certainthat no discrimination against recovered materials exists. b. <T3>Use of invitations for bids and requests for proposals. </T3>Contractorsbuy a large portion of the insulation purchased with appropriated Federaldollars as part of their work to build or renovate structures. Therefore,to fulfill their obligations regarding procurement of building insulationproducts containing recovered materials to the maximum extent practicable,EPA recommends in andSection; 248.11(b) of the guideline that procuring agenciesinsert minimum content standards or equivalent preferences for recoveredmaterials content in building insulation in their contract solicitations.A commenter questioned EPA's recommendation to use CIDs whenever possibleand stated that RCRA requires procuring agencies to use specificationsthat affirmatively require the use of recovered materials ``to the maximumextent practicable.'' EPA believes that returning to the use of separatespecifications for government procurements would be burdensome, expensive,and time consuming for procuring agencies and their contractors. Further,EPA believes that inserting minimum content standards in IFBs and RFPsis the most efficient way to assure use of recovered materials to the maximumextent practicable. However, EPA is aware that architects, designers, engineers, and buildingcontractors refer to commercial item descriptions, national standards,and local building codes when preparing their solicitation documents. Therefore,EPA recommends that the entities responsible for drafting such codes andstandards consider incorporating the recommended minimum content standards.Another commenter agreed that minimum content standards should be insertedin IFBs and RFPs but stated more was needed. The commenter recommendedthat procuring agencies include such information in pre-bid conferencesand notices about bids; the commenter further recommended that EPA sponsorseminars for Federal and state agencies and their contractors to explainhow the section 6002 requirements are to be incorporated into bids andbid solicitations. EPA notes that the first suggestion is already coveredunder the promotion program requirements discussed below. With respectto the second suggestion, regional seminars regarding section 6002 requirementsare currently being planned. c. <T3>Exclusion of products that do not meet performance standards. </T3>Certainbuilding insulation products cannot be made with recovered materials contentwithout jeopardizing performance standards. In general, this situationapplies to specialty materials and insulation items that must meet verystringent performance requirements. In most cases, EPA does not believethat such items will be offered to procuring agencies with recovered materialscontent. If such items are offered and found to fail performance tests,andSection; 248.11(c) recommends that an agency document any finding that,for a particular end-use, an item containing recovered materials contentwill not meet reasonable performance standards. The documentation shouldreference the particular tests used to judge performance. Procuring agenciesshould also reference such documentation in subsequent solicitations forthe specific item to avoid repetition of previously documented findings.d. <T3>New and adapted products. </T3>EPA believes that as new building insulationproducts enter the marketplace and as recycling technologies advance forfeedstocks used in insulation manufacture, additional types of buildinginsulation with recovered content will become available. EPA recommendsin andSection; 248.11(d) of the guideline that procuring agencies assurethat language in new specifications for new building insulation productsallows recovered materials content. EPA further recommends that as newbuilding insulation products containing recovered materials are identified,the same approaches to procurement recommended in this guideline for existingproducts be inserted in invitations for bids and requests for proposalswhenever the new products could be offered. The annual review procedure detailed in andSection; 248.24 of this guideline,the certification and estimation process detailed in andSection; 248.23,and the case-by-case procurement approach detailed in andSection; 248.21provide methods to monitor the introduction of recovered materials contentin building insulation products where such use may be developing. G. Affirmative Procurement Program RCRA section 6002(i) requires procuring agencies to adopt an affirmativeprocurement program to ensure that building insulation products containingrecovered materials are purchased to the maximum extent practicable. Theprogram must contain four elements: (1) A recovered materials preferenceprogram; (2) a promotion program; (3) procedures for estimation, certification,and verification of recovered materials content; and (4) procedures forannual review and monitoring of the program's effectiveness. The programmust be established within one year of the date of publication of thisguideline as a final rule.The following sections explain EPA's recommendations for each element ofthe affirmative procurement program. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Recovered Materials Preference Program </ITAG>Under section 6002(i), procuring agencies have three options for implementingthe preference program. They can employ a case-by-case approach, adoptminimum content standards, or choose an approach that is ``substantiallyequivalent'' to the preceding approaches. The guideline recommends thatprocuring agencies adopt minimum content standards for those building insulationproducts commercially available with recovered materials content. A listof products and recommended minimum content standards is provided. Theguideline further recommends a procedure for implementing the minimum contentstandards approach when contracting for building design, construction,alteration, or repair. For individual procurements of a type of insulationfor which the procuring agency has not established a minimum content standard,EPA recommends that the procuring agency use the case-by-case approachand recommends methods for implementing this approach when using sealedbidding or competitive negotiation. EPA notes that these approaches are <T3>recommended, </T3>not required. Procuring agencies may adopt ``substantiallyequivalent'' alternatives. However, EPA believes that if a procuring agencyfollows the recommendations, it will meet the requirements of RCRA. Procuringagencies that adopt other approaches must ensure that their preferenceprograms achieve the procurement of building insulation products ``withthe maximum percentage of recovered materials practicable.'' The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the basis for therecommended minimum content standards, including legal and technical considerations;the recommended procedure for implementing the minimum content standardsapproach when using contractors; and the recommended case-by-case approach.a. <T3>Background. </T3>Considering the range of building insulation productscommercially available with recovered materials content, EPA believes thatthe use of minimum content standards is the most practical approach forprocuring agencies to use. The minimum content standards approach wouldalso be the most effective way to insure that building insulation productsare purchased with the maximum percentage of recovered materials practicable,as required by RCRA sections 6002 (c) and (i). EPA today recommends minimum content standards for most types of buildinginsulation products. EPA believes that these minimum content standardsare the highest that are currently practicable, and procuring agencieswould therefore meet the requirements of section 6002 if the minimum contentstandards are adopted. These standards are discussed further in sectionIV.G.1.d. of this preamble. b. <T3>Alternatives considered. </T3>In addition to minimum content standardsand case-by-case procurement, EPA considered two other approaches for apreference program: price preferences and set-asides. As discussed in the final paper guideline, 53 FR 23553 (June 22, 1988),section 6002(i) requires that any affirmative procurement program be consistentwith applicable provisions of Federal procurement law. From time to time,Congress has established preferential procurement programs in order toattain socioeconomic goals. Among those are the Small Business, Labor SurplusArea, and Minority Business procurement programs. EPA considered applyingeither or both of the mechanisms used in those programs_price preferencesand set-asides_to this guideline. A price preference allows the procuringagency to pay a higher price, if necessary, for a specified product frompreferred vendors. A set-aside requires the procuring agency to award acertain percentage of its contracts to preferred vendors of a product regardlessof price. Price preferences and set-asides are currently being used insome state programs for the procurement of paper and paper products containingrecovered materials. As of October 1988, eight states and two cities useprice preference programs in which products containing recovered materialsmay cost from 5 to 10 percent more than products made with virgin materials.Three states have set-aside programs, two for paper and paper products,the other for all types of products. Several of these states report thatthey successfully procure products containing recovered materials. EPA has considered recommending these programs at the Federal level. Inthe case of existing Federal preferential procurement programs that allowa price preference or set-aside, the Agency found that each had been establishedunder explicit statutory authority or a specific Executive Order. Neitherthe statutory language nor the legislative history of section 6002 seems,however, to contemplate the adoption of either price preferences or set-asides,and doing so would conflict with existing Federal procurement regulations.Therefore, rather than recommending price preferences or set-asides, EPAis recommending that procuring agencies use the procurement mechanismsprovided in RCRA section 6002(i)(3). c. <T3>Legal considerations. </T3>RCRA section 6002(i)(1) requires that affirmativeprocurement programs be ``consistent with applicable Federal procurementlaw.'' EPA was concerned that minimum content standards might violate theCompetition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA) (10 U.S.C. Chapter 137) andthe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Ch. 1). Both provide thatspecifications restricting what can be offered are legally permissibleonly to the extent that they reflect the Government's minimum needs orare authorized by law. (CICA 2711(a)(2), 48 CFR 10.002(a)(3)(ii).) EPApreviously has concluded that RCRA section 6002 provides the necessaryauthorization. See 52 FR 38844 (October 19, 1987). Section 6002(i)(3)(B)expressly permits agencies to establish specifications which restrict offersto those which meet a minimum content standard. Therefore, minimum contentstandards are not in violation of general Federal procurement law. CICA requires agencies to use full and open competitive procedures whenprocuring property and services. The term ``full and open competition''means that all responsible sources must be permitted to submit an offer.In the case of a procurement against a restrictive specification, suchas a minimum content standard, ``full and open competition'' means thatall responsible sources who can meet the specification can submit an offer.The preference program recommendation in the guideline is consistent withthis requirement, since any person can submit an offer as long as the buildinginsulation products offered contain the minimum recovered content. d. <T3>The minimum content recommendations. </T3>RCRA provides four criteriafor establishing a minimum content standard. Section 6002(i)(3)(B) providesthat the minimum content required by a specification must be the maximumavailable without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item or violatingthe limitations of section 6002(c)(1)(A) through (C). Thus, the four criteriaare (1) the intended end use of the item, (2) availability, (3) technicalperformance, and (4) price. For the items designated by this guideline, the criteria are satisfiedby setting the minimum content standards at levels which do not interferewith the technical performance of the items and therefore the intendedend uses. In general, the use of recovered materials content within thetechnical limitations is cost-effective in insulation production, regardlessof the type. The second criterion, availability, will be the determiningfactor. There is a possibility, though not a probability, that industriesother than insulation may eventually absorb most of the available suppliesof recovered materials suitable for certain types of building insulation(e.g., slag used in rock wool production). Should that occur, the case-by-caseapproach described below can be used until it is certain that market stimulationfor the recovered material is no longer needed. EPA believes that minimum content standards can be set most efficientlyby the percentage by weight in relation to other ingredients for each typeof building insulation product. While there are variations in the technicallyacceptable levels of recovered materials content among the myriad typesof building insulation products within most material types, they are notwide enough to warrant a separate minimum content standard for each buildinginsulation item. EPA recommends in andSection; 248.21(a)(4) of the guideline that procuringagencies adopt the minimum content standards listed in Table 6 for alltypes of building insulation products made with the respective types ofmaterial. The standards are based on the core insulation material, disregardingthe facings, bindings, or any materials surrounding or attached to theinsulation core as discussed above in section IV.B., Scope. The minimumcontent standards would also apply to the portion(s) of the respectiveinsulation material(s) that is used in composite products.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 6._<T4>Minimum Content Standards for Recovered Materials in Building InsulationProducts</T4><H1>Material type </H1><H1>Percent by weight</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on <D>75% postconsumer recovered paper.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perlite composite board<D>23% postconsumer recovered paper.</D></ITAG>Plastic rigid foams:<ITAG tagnum="12">Polyisocyanurate/polyurethane:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Rigid foam </ITAG><D>9% recovered material.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Foam-in-place </ITAG><D>5% recovered material.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Glass fiber reinforced </ITAG><D>6% recovered material.</D><ITAG tagnum="2">Phenolic rigid foam <D>5% recovered material.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rock wool <D>50% recovered material.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> The minimum content standards are based on the weight ofmaterial (not volume) in the insulating core only.</ITAG>Each of the minimum content standards has been set based on technical constraintsin the manufacturing processes used in 1988. EPA requested comments onthe appropriateness of these standards and requested specific alternatives.One commenter questioned ``why EPA invariably recommended a minimum contentstandard at the low end * * * when the purpose of section 6002 is to encourageadditional purchases of products containing recovered material by the government.''The commenter wanted more research by EPA on average percentages of recoveredmaterials used and the average percentage of manufacturers that regularlymeet or exceed the average so EPA could substantiate that its recommendedminimum content standards are the highest practicable. EPA reviewed theminimum content standards with the respective industries, revised themupwards when possible, and clarified the limitations as needed. EPA confirmedthat recovered materials are usually preferred by insulation manufacturersfor economic reasons and that higher percentages would be used if performancestandards could still be met. Building insulation products are made inseveral variations for many material types (e.g., perlite composite boards).In such cases, minimum content standards have been set at the low end ofa range to accommodate all variations of a particular product type.There are cases where percentages of recovered materials vary among manufacturersof the same product (e.g., cellulose loose-fill, where the range is 75-80percent). EPA notes that technical performance of a given building insulationproduct is critical to its selection by contractors and architects. Productsthat do not perform well will not be ordered again. Every building insulationproduct for which a minimum content standard is recommended holds a comparativelysmall share of the market. EPA believes that increasing market share forproducts made with recovered materials will have a much greater impacton consumption of recovered materials than raising individual minimum contentstandards by a few percentage points. EPA further believes that pushingmanufacturers to their technical limitations and therefore risking productfailure could easily prove counter-productive to ``encouraging additionalpurchases of products containing recovered material.''EPA notes that a commenter speaking for the plastics industry supportedthe guideline as proposed in principle, stating that the minimum contentstandards for the plastic foam insulation products ``are all indicativeof the technology which is being practiced in the industry today.''The following subsections discuss the minimum content standards and includethe comments for each product type.i. <T3>Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on insulation.</T3> The principal feedstockfor cellulose loose-fill and spray-on insulation is waste paper. In thecase of spray-on insulation, the minimum content standard is applied tothe insulating feedstock prior to the addition of adhesives.Section 6002(i)(2) states that ``in the case of paper, the recovered materialspreference program required * * * shall provide for the maximum use ofthe postconsumer recovered materials * * *.'' Postconsumer waste paper,primarily old newspaper, is not only technically acceptable in celluloseinsulation, it is most frequently used.A variety of chemical additives are also combined with the fibers to retardflammability and to deter pests. The chemical additives are required tomeet the performance standards that have been established for this industry.The range of fiber is 75-80 percent, while the range of chemicals is 20-25percent. The highest percentage of waste paper fiber could jeopardize theperformance of the end use product for many manufacturers. For these reasons,EPA recommends a 75 percent postconsumer recovered paper minimum contentstandard for cellulose insulation as the highest feasible. No commentswere received on this minimum content standard.ii. <T3>Fiberboard. </T3>The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)defines fiberboards in its specification C208 ``Insulating Board (CellulosicFiber), Structural and Decorative'' as follows: fibrous-felted homogeneouspanel made from ligno-cellulosic fibers (usually wood or cane) and havinga density less than 31 lb/ft3 (497 kg/m3) but more than 10 lb/ft3 (160kg/m3). It is characterized by an integral bond which is produced by interfeltingthe fibers, but which has not been consolidated under heat and pressureas a separate stage of manufacture. Other materials may be added duringmanufacture to improve certain properties.In the proposed guideline, EPA inquired whether or not ASTM specificationC208 includes the fiberboards made with paper. A commenter informed EPAthat ``laminated paperboard'' and ``homogeneous board from repulped paper''were not covered by C208. However, the commenter continued, a fiberboardmade with approximately 20% postconsumer recovered paper and approximately80% bagasse (waste sugar cane fiber) is covered by ASTM C208. Only onecompany makes this product; the majority of the fiberboards are made withwood fibers only.EPA has subsequently learned more about all products from commenters. Accordingto their manufacturers, ``homogeneous board from repulped paper'' doesmeet ASTM C208, while the laminated paperboards do not meet the densityrequirements. At least one company uses nearly 100 percent postconsumerrecovered paper material in its homogeneous board from repulped paper.This was not true for the laminated paperboard companies. One company usesa range of 50 percent to 80 percent postconsumer corrugated boxes; othercompanies primarily use kraft linerboard trimmings which are manufacturingand converting wastes. The companies using only wood fiber state that theirfeedstocks meet the RCRA definition of recovered materials. The wood fibersconsist of scrap from plywood plants, lumberyard wastes, trim, waste fiberfrom hardwood operations and small chip fines which are not of sufficientquality for paper pulp.In evaluating information submitted by commenters, EPA has concluded thatmany issues remain unanswered, and information from commenters is contradictory.Therefore, EPA is not able to define this product nor to recommend minimumcontent standards at this time. EPA will gather further information andwill consider recommending minimum content standards for this product ata later date. In the interim, fiberboards made with cellulose that arepurchased for insulation use continue to fall within the scope of thisguideline, and EPA recommends that procuring agencies use the case-by-caseapproach, as set out in andSection; 248.21(b), when purchasing this item.This approach is described below in section IV.G.1.f.Among the issues being examined by EPA are:1. How should this product be defined? Two options are being considered:andbullet; Option 1_Use the term, <T3>Recycled Fiber Insulating Board, </T3>defined as fibrous-felted, homogenouspulp, or laminated paperboard fiberboard, with or without facings, primarilycomposed of recovered material(s) (such as paper, cane or wood fibers)which provides thermal resistance and perhaps other properties. andbullet; Option 2_Use the term, <T3>Cellulosic Fiberboard, </T3>and definition used in ASTM specificationC208. 2. What should the minimum content standard be? Should it be for postconsumerrecovered paper or for the more broadly defined recovered materials whichwould include waste wood? ln either case, what is the highest practicablepercentage of recycled content? 3. Some fiberboards contain postconsumer newspaper, which clearly is asolid waste management problem. Other fiberboards are made with manufacturingwood wastes, which meet the RCRA definition ``recovered materials.'' Aremanufacturing wood wastes currently a solid waste management problem? IfEPA were to limit the scope of the guideline to fiberboards made from postconsumerrecovered paper, would manufacturers switch from wood fibers to postconsumerpaper fibers? Would such a switch simply result in a change in the compositionof the waste stream without a net reduction in volume? Or, will wood wastesbe diverted to another use, such as fuel? 4. Should EPA limit the designated item to fiberboard products that meetthe ASTM C208 specification, thus eliminating the laminated paperboards?5. Should fiberboard be excluded from the guideline because it is technicallya structural product, rather then an insulation product? iii. <T3>Perlite composite board. </T3>The range of products in this type ofinsulation is made with various formulations of expanded perlite aggregate,selected binders, and old newspaper. The newspaper component is 23 percentto 30 percent, depending on the thickness and strength requirements ofthe finished product. For example, as the perlite fraction increases, R-valueincreases and strength decreases. According to the industry, although anincrease in the newspaper component would be economically advantageousto the manufacturer, it would interfere with performance requirements inindividual products. EPA recommends a minimum content standard of 23 percentpostconsumer recovered paper to assure that all variations of perlite compositeboard are covered by the guideline, and to assure that performance is notjeopardized. iv. <T3>Polyisocyanurate/polyurethane (PIR/PU) rigid foam board insulation.</T3>The minimum recovered materials content standard for the PIR/PU rigidfoams applies to the total feedstocks in the core materials. However, onlythe polyol fraction contains recovered materials; recovered materials arenot available for the other components. Therefore, the minimum contentstandard cannot be very high. Further, a range of formulations, as shownin Table 7, is used within the industry to achieve special characteristicsfor different end use products. <ITAG tagnum="74">Table 7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Components of Polyisocyanurate and Polyurethane Rigid Foam </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">53-57% isocyanate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">20-30% aromatic polyester polyol </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">15-20% blowing agent </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25"> 2- 3% surfactants and catalysts</ITAG>As discussed above, there are also two types of recovered materials usedin entirely different processes to make polyol, chemical bottoms (DMT andpossibly phthalic anhydride) and PET plastic scrap. EPA solicited but receivedno comments on its conclusion that DMT and phthalic anhydride waste bottomsqualify as recovered materials under the RCRA definition. The constraints to increasing the minimum content standard are common toboth types of recovered materials. The industry asserts that polyols withhigher percentages of recovered materials have characteristics that inhibitthe flow of the liquid foaming mass prior to the hardening of the massinto rigid cells. This would have adverse effects on the performance characteristicsof the finished products. Further, the PIR/PU rigid foam industry, includingall the feedstock suppliers, is currently experimenting with blowing agentsother than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These substitute blowing agentsare not as efficient as CFCs. Larger quantities by weight may be necessaryin the product mixes and would therefore change the relative percentageof polyol. EPA has taken the second constraint into consideration in settingthe minimum recovered materials content standard at 9 percent, the highestpercentage possible for the lowest percentage of PET-based polyol in therange of product formulations. To avoid confusion in terms and the applicationof minimum content standards to individual products, one minimum contentstandard, 9 percent, is to be used for all PIR/PU board products. The tradeassociation for the industry has informed EPA that this level is consistentwith current technology. EPA believes that this percentage will providethe maximum amount practicable. A commenter opposed this standard because it excluded a certain formulation,and provided information about a particular product. EPA concluded thatthere was sufficient reason to consider the product separately rather thandrop the standard for all other related products. This additional productis discussed in the following section. v. <T3>Glass fiber reinforced PIR/PU foam. </T3>As introduced above, the commenteropposing the 9 percent minimum content standard for PIR/PU rigid foam boardinsulation stated that its fiberglass reinforced PIR board is producedwith a lower proportion of polyol and consequently a lower percentage ofrecovered materials. The proportions are: 67 percent isocyanate; 15 percentaromatic polyester polyol; and 18 percent catalysts, surfactants, blowingagents, and glass fibers. The proportion of recovered materials (40 percent) in the polyol fractionis the same as other PIR/PU boards. This results in 6 percent recoveredmaterials in the total formulation. The commenter believed the fiberglasswas made with recovered materials. However, EPA has learned that the fiberglassreinforcement may be made with ``re-feed,'' but it is not currently madewith a recovered material meeting the RCRA definition. EPA has determined that this product has different characteristics thanthe other PIR/PU foam boards (according to Federal specification HH-I-1972/1)and that dropping the minimum content standard for all related productswould not meet the objectives of Section 6002. EPA has further determinedthat this is a separate type of PIR/PU board and should therefore havea separate minimum content standard. EPA has established that the minimumcontent standard for this product is 6 percent based <T3>only</T3> on the recovered material proportion of the polyol. The tableof minimum content standards and the preamble have been revised accordingly.vi. <T3>PIR/PU foam-in-place insulation. </T3>The minimum content standardfor PIR/PU foam-in-place insulation applies to the total feedstocks. However,only the polyester polyol fraction contains recovered materials. The percentagesof ingredients is shown in Table 8. The other ingredients also vary comparedwith PIR/PU board. <ITAG tagnum="74">Table 8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Components of PIR/PU Foam-in-Place </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">40% isocyanate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">40% polyol </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">aromatic polyester, 30% </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">polyether, 70% </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">20% blowing agent</ITAG>As with aromatic polyester polyols for PIR/PU board products, the recoveredDMT or PET is reacted with glycol in similar ratios. The same constraintsregarding the eventual change from CFC to another blowing agent also applyto the PIR/PU foam-in-place products. EPA therefore recommends a minimumcontent standard of 5 percent for PIR/PU foam-in-place rigid foam. No commentersopposed this standard. vii. <T3>Phenolic rigid foam insulation. </T3>The only component of phenolicrigid foam insulation that can contain recovered materials is the aromaticpolyester polyol which is used in small quantities as a plasticizer. Theproduct formulations vary according to specific product and are expressedin ranges to protect competitive information. The polyol fraction, accordingto industry spokesmen, was said to be 3 percent to 10 percent of the total.The mixture of glycol to DMT or PET differs from the PIR/PU foams whenit is used in phenolics as a plasticizer. The ratio is 10 parts glycolto 90 parts other ingredients. Industry sources have asserted that there are two technical constraintsto setting a higher minimum content standard based on the use of polyol.First, larger percentages of polyol used as a plasticizer produce an endproduct that is too soft for commercial application with mechanized roofingequipment. Second, manufacturers need leeway in product formulations fordifferent product types and to accommodate potential changes in blowingagents. A commenter stated that the recommended minimum content standard of 4 percentwas acceptable as a minimum but it was probably on the low side. EPA haslearned that the product mix for phenolic foam includes slightly more polyol(6 percent) which, according to the glycol/polyol ratio, results in productformulations with 5 percent recovered materials. Therefore, the recommendedminimum content standard has been raised to 5 percent recovered materials.viii. <T3>Rock wool insulation. </T3>The rock wool industry uses either metallurgicalslags or natural rock to make rock wool fiber. Although some manufacturersare entirely dependent on slag as feedstock, this is not true in certainparts of the country where good quality metallurgical slags are no longereasily available. EPA believes that the only constraint to setting a higherminimum content standard is the availability of the recovered materialfeedstock. As discussed earlier, a commenter recommended that mineral wool producedwith spent aluminum potliner be included within the scope of the guideline.EPA has learned that some manufacturers have begun to use spent aluminumpotliner in their process lines and that practice may become more commonin the future. However, this innovation was not widespread in late 1988and may be interrupted until hazardous waste issues are resolved. Therefore,EPA has not set a specific minimum content standard for spent aluminumpotliner, nor has EPA increased the recommended minimum content standardfor rock wool to include the use of potliner. Instead, EPA encourages rockwool manufacturers to include their use of spent aluminum potliner whenfiguring their recovered material content for purposes of estimation andcertification. EPA also considered geographic availability of rock wool insulation whensetting the recommended minimum recovered material content standard at50 percent. EPA believes that this percentage will provide the maximumamount practicable. No commenters either approved or contested this standard.ix. <T3>Fiberglass insulation. </T3>Several commenters questioned EPA's decisionnot to recommend a minimum content standard for fiberglass. One commenternoted ``given the mounds of garbage strangling our cities, this is indeeda bizarre position for EPA to take.'' It was suggested that EPA set a moderateminimum content standard to encourage fiberglass manufacturers to overcometechnical problems. While EPA appreciates this point of view, the mostimmediate technical problem, available supplies of postconsumer glass feedstocks,must still be resolved. Despite mounds of garbage, and a comment that EPAwork with public and private agencies to ensure an adequate supply of cullet,neither EPA nor the commenters themselves could discover any current orpotential supplies of uncontaminated postconsumer bottle cullet that wouldnot be eagerly absorbed by other industries. Several other commenters offered another approach to encourage the fiberglassindustry to consume additional recovered glass cullet. They suggested includingfiberglass in the table of recommended minimum content standards, but withan asterisk rather than a percentage value. The asterisk would note that``no value is established until such time as recovered materials are readilyavailable,'' or ``not practical to establish minimum percentage by weightat this time.'' Because the purpose of the guideline is to promote the procurement of productsmade with materials recovered from the solid waste stream and because fiberglassinsulation is not being made routinely with such materials, EPA sees nopoint in listing it in the table of recommended minimum content standards.EPA believes that use of the case-by-case approach, as recommended in andSection;248.21(b), is appropriate for fiberglass insulation and will be the mostefficient method to implement the preference for recovered materials. Another commenter suggested that EPA monitor agencies to assure that theyare procuring fiberglass with recovered material content and use informationfrom the agencies to revise the guideline. This comment applies equallyto all building insulation types. As part of a program to assist procuringagencies to implement the various procurement guidelines, EPA plans tomonitor procuring agencies' activities and to review the results of theirannual reviews of their programs. Another commenter stated that fiberglass companies could establish longterm contracts with communities that have aggressive curb-side collectionprograms. EPA considers this a good approach and encourages fiberglassmanufacturers to do so. x. <T3>Polystyrene rigid foam. </T3>In the proposed guideline, EPA statedthat polystyrene insulation containing recovered materials is technicallyfeasible but not yet commercially available. For this reason, EPA proposedto recommend that procuring agencies use the case-by-case approach whenprocuring this product. A company commented that it produced a polystyrene foam building insulationproduct that used ``a minimum of 25 percent polystyrene that was deemedunusable in food service products due to color or other specification deviations.''The commenter proposed a minimum content standard of 25 percent for polystyrenefoam \1/4\ inch and \3/8\ inch protection and underlayment boards. EPAlearned that in-plant scrap previously sold to outside scrap processorsis the only material in current use. Although purchased or postconsumerpolystyrene will probably be used if it can be obtained in the future,no materials representing a solid waste management problem are currentlybeing used. Further, the industry trade association has informed EPA thatpolystyrene products containing recovered materials are not commerciallyavailable. EPA therefore concludes that it is premature to set a minimumcontent standard for this product, or for any polystyrene foam buildinginsulation product, and is retaining in the final guideline the recommendationto use the case-by-case approach when procuring these products. e. <T3>Recommended procedures for implementing the minimum content standardsapproach. </T3>Building insulation products are procured directly by (1)government agencies and (2) agency contractors as part of contracts forbuilding construction, alteration, or repair. Selection of building insulationproducts thus can be made by agency personnel or by contractors. EPA believes that the selection of the appropriate building insulationproducts should be made by the procuring agency architect or contractorarchitect and should not be left to the supplier or to the constructioncontractor, who can be expected to select the least expensive product available.In that circumstance, the cheaper price will become the justification forthe purchase, because availability only at an unreasonable price is oneof the statutorily provided limitations on the requirement to procure buildinginsulation products containing recovered materials to the maximum extentpracticable. Therefore, new andSection; 248.21(a)(6) has been added to thefinal guideline. EPA recommends that procuring agencies which have establishedminimum content standards for building insulation implement those standardsboth in the design phase and in procurement of building insulation productsor building construction, alteration, and repair services.EPA is recommending that during the design phase of a building project(1) the designing architect, whether a procuring agency employee or a contractor,be given the responsibility for selecting building insulation products,(2) the designing architect incorporate the procuring agency's minimumcontent standards into their insulation selection criteria, (3) if morethan one type of insulation will satisfy the procuring agency's needs andmeet the procuring agency's minimum content standards, then the type withthe highest minimum content standard should be preferred, (4) the architectdetermine whether building insulation products containing the procuringagency's minimum recovered materials content are available, (5) the architectadvise the procuring agency in writing when such products are not availableand as to the recovered materials content that is available, (6) the architectjustify in writing selection of a building insulation product that eitherdoes not contain recovered materials or contains less than the procuringagency's minimum, and (7) the procuring agency review the justificationsto assure that they are consistent with RCRA section 6002(c)(1). When contractingfor building insulation or for construction, alteration, or repair services,EPA recommends that the procuring agency specify in solicitations boththe type(s) of building insulation products to be used and the recoveredmaterials content that the products must have. As explained above under the discussion of the minimum content standardrecommendations, it is not possible to set minimum content standards forsome types of insulation at this time because they are not commerciallyavailable containing recovered materials. For example, industry sourceshave suggested that polystyrene insulation containing recovered materialsis technically feasible, and research and development efforts are underway.Similarly, while fiberglass insulation containing recovered materials istechnically feasible, American manufacturers do not routinely produce it.In addition, new types of insulation or insulation products may be introduced,which might or might not contain recovered materials. Thus, there willbe instances when the designing architect selects a type of insulationfor which the procuring agency has not yet established a minimum contentstandard. Assuming that the selection otherwise satisfies the requirementsof RCRA section 6002, EPA recommends that procuring agencies use the case-by-caseapproach when procuring these types of insulation. f. <T3>Case-by-case procurement. </T3>The case-by-case approach means thatoffers are solicited for the selected type of building insulation withan unspecified percentage of recovered materials content. In other words,offerors may offer building insulation products containing recovered materialsranging from 1 percent to 100 percent of the total product or made entirelywith virgin materials. When using sealed bidding, EPA recommends that,in the case of otherwise identical low bids, the procuring agency awardthe contract to the bidder offering the building insulation product(s)containing the highest percentage of recovered materials.\2\<NOTE/> In the case of negotiated procurements, EPA recommends thatprocuring agencies add to their evaluation criteria a criterion which rewardsthe offeror for the quantity of recovered materials in the building insulationproducts offered. In other words, if offeror A offers a building insulationproduct containing 45 percent recovered materials and offeror B offersa building insulation product containing 50 percent recovered materials,both offerors will receive credit for offering products containing recoveredmaterials, but Offeror B will receive more credit than Offeror A.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ EPA believes that the recovered materials preference authorizedby section 6002 should be incorporated into the equal low bids provisionof the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Therefore, EPA recommendsthat Federal entities responsible for periodic revision of the FAR considermodifying 48 CFR 14.407-6 to incorporate a preference for vendors offeringto provide procurement items which have been designated by EPA under RCRAsection 6002(e).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The case-by-case approach differs from the minimum contentstandards approach in this respect; under the latter approach, offerorsmust meet the minimum standard but are not rewarded for offering productscontaining higher percentages of recovered materials. One commenter stated that it was unclear whether the case-by-case approachis to be used only within product types of the same material or if it appliesacross product types (e.g., polyisocyanurate and polystyrene rigid foamboards). It is EPA's intent that the case-by-case approach only be usedwithin a product type of the same material (e.g., two separate bids forfiberglass batt). g. <T3>Limitations set by RCRA. </T3>As mentioned above, the minimum contentstandard would be subject to the four limitations provided in RCRA section6002, namely, not jeopardizing the intended end use of the product, reasonableavailability, reasonable price, and ability to meet the performance standardsin the specifications. Procuring agencies must also be able to maintaina reasonable level of competition. For example, if a procuring agency determinesthat it cannot obtain a type of building insulation containing the minimumamount of recovered materials or that it cannot obtain the insulation ata reasonable price, or that an insufficient number of offers can be obtainedto meet competition requirements, the procuring agency can re-evaluatethe minimum content standard. Lower minimum content standards can be testedfor the particular type of insulation product. Section 248.21(c) of theguideline provides that the recommended procurement approaches, or anyother approach used by a procuring agency, are subject to the RCRA limitations.h. <T3>Procurement procedures. </T3>Procuring agencies must examine theirprocurement policies and procedures and eliminate those which discriminateagainst recovered materials content in building insulation products. Notethat the phrase ``procurement policies and procedures'' does not includepublished regulations. Instead, EPA is referring to internal policies and/orprocedures which would unjustifiably inhibit or preclude procurement ofbuilding insulation products containing recovered materials. In the proposed guideline, EPA <T3>recommended </T3>that agencies review their procurement practices.A commenter stated that procuring agencies <T3>must </T3>eliminate discrimination in purchasing practices to conformwith statutory requirements. EPA agrees. All procuring agencies, Federaland non-Federal alike, are required by RCRA sections (c)(1) and (i) toprocure items designated by EPA composed of the highest percentage of recoveredmaterials practicable. Even if a procuring agency has nondiscriminatoryspecifications, if a procurement practice undercuts procurement of productscontaining recovered materials, the procuring agency has failed to meetthe statutory requirements. As discussed above, under RCRA section 6002(c)(1),there are only four reasons for failing to procure items containing recoveredmaterials: the level of competition is unsatisfactory; the items are notreasonably available within a reasonable period of time; the items failto meet the performance standards set forth in the applicable specifications;or the items are only available at an unreasonable price. Unless the procurementpractice that precludes purchase of EPA-designated items containing recoveredmaterials is justified on one of these grounds, it is contrary to section6002. Therefore, it is implicit in RCRA sections 6002(c)(1) and (i) thatprocuring agencies must review and revise their practices. EPA has amendedandSection; 248.21(d) in the final rule to state that agencies must, ratherthan should, do so. EPA notes that in the lubricating oil and retread tires procurement guidelines,it was stated that RCRA section 6002(d) required procuring agencies toreview and revise their procurement practices. In those guidelines, EPAconcluded that the term ``specifications,'' as used in section 6002(d),should not be viewed in the narrow technical sense of an item specificationand that Congress intended to refer to all procurement practices relatedto specifying what a procuring agency intends to purchase. (See 53 FR 247l0,June 30, 1988, and 53 FR 46567, November 17, 1988.) EPA has reconsideredits prior conclusion regarding the meaning of ``specifications'' in section6002(d). EPA has now concluded that the bases for the requirement to reviewand revise procurement practices are section 6002(c)(1) and (i).A commenter urged that performance characteristics be the primary criterionfor choosing a building insuIation product to avoid discrimination againstproducts without recovered material content. If all performance characteristicsare weighed and several products competing for the same application appearto be equal, the commenter supported procurement based on minimum contentstandards. Other commenters were concerned that the guideline did not mandatethe selection of the product with the highest recovered material contentwhenever the option to choose between products arises. Similarly, commentersstated that, in situations where two or more products meet a specific need,a product containing recovered materials must be used. EPA believes that these commenters overstate the intended application ofthe Act. First, it is clear that Congress understood and intended thatsection 6002 would discriminate against items produced with virgin materials.This is evidenced in the requirement to develop a preference program foritems produced with recovered materials. Moreover, the Act mandates thatprocuring agencies consider the use of minimum content standards as anapproach to implementing this preference. Thus, Congress rejected the notionthat performance characteristics of designated procurement items shouldbe the primary criterion for selection as between items produced usingrecovered materials and those produced with virgin materials. Conversely, Congress did not require the selection of a particular productsimply because that product contains a higher recovered material contentthan other products of the same type offered in response to a procurementsolicitation. The Act specifically limits the preference for recoveredmaterials so as not to subordinate certain other policies pursued throughthe procurement process. Thus, for example, the policy preferring the procurementof items produced using recovered materials is explicitly subordinatedto the policy that a satisfactory level of competition be maintained. Additionallimitations are set forth in section 6002(c)(1) (A) through (C). Theselimitations are carried forward in section 6002(i)(3)(B) and delimit thepreference program recommended in the final guideline. Thus, the recommendedminimum content standards set forth in andSection; 248.21 describe EPA'sjudgment as to the current level of recovered materials content that canbe required in agency specifications without violating the limitationsof section 6002(c)(1) (A) through (C). Accordingly, no additional preferenceis given to offerors who propose to supply items containing a percentageof recovered materials content higher than the recommended minimum. Todo so would render the procurement process unworkable, and would elevatethe policy for procurement of recovered materials over the limitationson that policy prescribed by the Congress. As between two equally suitable <T3>types </T3>of building insulation products for which minimum contentstandards have been established, however, there is a preference for theuse of the <T3>type </T3>of product (e.g., cellulose loose-fill versus perlite compositeboard) having the higher established minimum content standard. Becausethe recommended minimum content standards account for the limitations ofsection 6002(c)(1) (A) through (C), the preference for the type of producthaving the higher minimum content standard is consistent with the Act.Moreover, since the selection of the type of insulation to be procuredwill be made prior to issuance of the procurement solicitation, this preferencewill not complicate the procurement process. It is the responsibility ofthe procuring agency, rather than EPA, to determine whether more than onetype of building insulation is suitable for its needs. The selection ofa particular type of building insulation may be governed by architecturalconsiderations, applicable building codes, desired performance characteristics,and other factors. However, in those cases where more than one type ofproduct meets the agency's needs, the product having the highest establishedminimum content standard should be specified. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Promotion Program </ITAG>The second requirement of the affirmative procurement program is a promotionaleffort by procuring agencies. Section 248.22 of the guideline recommendsseveral methods for procuring agencies to use for disseminating informationabout their preference programs, such as placing statements in solicitations,discussing the program at bidders' conferences, informing industry tradeassociations about the program, providing information about building insulationmade with recovered materials in the product information programs sponsoredby the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and issuing press releasesdiscussing the affirmative procurement program. In andSection; 248.22(f)of the proposed guideline, EPA recommended press releases to the recyclingindustry. In response to comments requesting broader promotion of the affirmativeprocurement program, EPA has included architectural and building tradepublications in the final recommendation regarding press releases. Thisrecommendation also will serve to inform contractors of their responsibilityto comply with the guideline when specifying or supplying building insulationproducts. Under section 521 of the National Housing Act, HUD is required to provideproduct-related services and publications. These should be used as avenuesto publicize recovered materials content in insulation. HUD publicationsinclude: andbullet; National Building Codes, andbullet; Bulletins, andbullet; Materials releases, andbullet; Engineering bulletins, andbullet; Use of materials information. EPA recommends that procuring agencies use all such avenues to publicizetheir requirements for recovered material content in building insulationproducts. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Estimation, Certification, and Verification </ITAG>The third requirement of the affirmative procurement program set forthin section 6002(i) covers estimation, certification, and verification ofrecovered material content in procurements. Estimates and certificationsof content in an item are most easily expressed as a percentage of totalcontent by weight and can range from 0 percent to 100 percent, dependingon the type of product or the feedstocks used in manufacturing the item.Many issues have been raised by commenters on previous guidelines aboutthese requirements, such as when the information should be provided, whois to provide it, and how it is to be obtained. To clarify this subject,it is necessary to review the requirements of the statute. a. <T3>Estimation. </T3>RCRA section 6002(c)(3)(B) and section 6002(i)(2)(C)require that, after the effective date of a guideline, contracting officersmust require vendors to provide an <T3>estimate </T3>of the total percentage of recovered materials utilizedin the performance of contracts to supply building insulation products.EPA believes that this requirement is for the purpose of gathering statisticalinformation on price, quantity, availability, and performance of productsmade from recovered materials. EPA further believes that this requirementapplies regardless of the approach used to acquire building insulationproducts (i.e., minimum content standards, case-by-case procurement, oran equivalent alternative). Estimates may differ from percentages of minimumrecovered content specified in certifications and will provide up-to-dateinformation for the annual review which is required of procuring agencies.Section 248.23(a) requires that contracting officers require vendors toprovide estimates of the total percentage of recovered content in buildinginsulation products supplied under their contracts. Note that the percentageof recovered content refers to the total content of the insulation <T3>core </T3>rather than the entire insulation product, which includesother items such as facings or bindings. EPA recommends that procuringagencies retain these data for three years by type of product, quantitypurchased, and price paid. b. <T3>Certification. </T3>The use of certifications is common in governmentprocurement. It is written assurance that goods or services delivered willconform to the contract specifications. Failure to meet the conditionswhich have been certified can result in penalties to a vendor. RCRA section6002(c)(3)(A) requires that after the effective date of this guideline,vendors must ``certify that the percentage of recovered materials to beused in the performance of the contract will be at least the amount requiredby applicable specifications or other contractual requirements.'' RCRA6002(i)(2)(C) requires ``certification of minimum recovered material contentactually utilized * * *.''Together, these sections could be interpreted to mean that multiple certificationswill be required: one when offers are submitted, and another with eachshipment. This issue was addressed in the paper guideline issued June 22,1988 (53 FR 23546). EPA concluded that one certification would fulfillboth statutory requirements and, by requiring the certification no matterwhich approach is used, procuring agencies could adapt their purchasingprograms most easily. For the same reasons enunciated in the paper guideline,EPA recommends in andSection; 248.23(b) that procuring agencies meet thecertification requirement in RCRA sections 6002(c)(3)(A) and 6002(i)(2)(C)by using a single certification prior to delivery or installation. The final guideline does not require that the contractor certify the actualrecovered materials content of the products supplied, but rather that therecovered materials content actually used meets or exceeds the contractminimum. When minimum content standards are used, the contract minimumis the standard specified in the solicitation; see andSection; 248.23(b)(1).When case-by-case procurement is used, the contract minimum is the minimumas specified in the offer provided in response to the solicitation; seeandSection; 248.23(b)(2). Accordingly, EPA recommends that procuring agencies require certificationwhen offers are submitted and, in the case of a contract for construction,alteration, or repair, prior to installation by a contractor, regardlessof whether the case-by-case, minimum content standard, or a substantiallyequivalent approach is used. Also, as previously stated, the successfulvendor must estimate the actual recovered content in building insulationproducts that are supplied. The estimate may or may not be different thanthe minimum percentage that is certified. EPA understands that for both estimation and certification, the vendormight not have direct knowledge of recovered materials content. Only themanufacturer that produces the insulation product will have that information.However, there is no direct authority in RCRA section 6002 for the FederalGovernment to require this information from anyone but the vendor. Therefore,vendors or contractors must make their own arrangements for obtaining thisinformation from manufacturers. c. <T3>Verification. </T3>Procuring agencies also are required to establish``reasonable verification procedures for estimates and certifications.''See RCRA section 6002(i)(2)(C). If these verification procedures includeaccess to manufacturers' records, then the procuring agency must use someauthority other than RCRA to inspect these records or must require vendorsor contractors to have an agreement with the manufacturer to supply suchinformation or access to the procuring agency. In general, insulation manufacturers maintain records of the feedstocksused in each ``batch'' for their own internal quality and specificationcontrols. The optimum mix of recovered and virgin materials often remainsthe same for each type of insulation though variations may occur in individualbatches. In most cases, manufacturers will be able to provide a certification tovendors or contractors as to the specific feedstock content of the productshipped to a customer. It is not intended that the guideline require anyadditional records to be kept by the manufacturers; records normally keptshould be complete enough to estimate or certify to recovered materialscontent accurately. However, to simplify the verification procedure andaccommodate variations dictated by quality control and supply, the averageof recovered materials used in each specific product over a one-month periodmay be used, if necessary, to meet the verification of estimates requirement.EPA recommends in andSection; 248.23(c)(2) that one-month figures be usedfor estimates of feedstock percentages. If it is necessary to verify theexact content of a specific batch of insulation, the manufacturers' recordsfor that batch can then be consulted. However, if the vendor knows that the recovered materials content of aninsulation product supplied to procuring agencies differs from the monthlyaverage, then the average cannot be used. For example, if the monthly averageis 30 percent recovered materials content but the insulation product suppliedcontains no recovered materials or conversely contains 60 percent recoveredcontent, then the vendor cannot use the monthly average. Use of the averagein such instances will be viewed as an attempt to circumvent the requirementsof RCRA in supplying insulation products to the procuring agency. Monthly <T3>averages </T3>cannot be used for certification. Every shipment maynot contain recovered materials content equal to or greater than the average.However, the <T3>minimum </T3>percentage of recovered materials used in insulation productsby the manufacturer can be determined from monthly records for certificationpurposes. It has been suggested that the various insulation industries are very competitiveand that the ``recipes'' for various insulation products are carefullyguarded trade secrets. However, the special ingredients that distinguishone manufacturer's product from another's are used in very small quantities.The volumes of virgin and recovered material feedstocks in question arefar larger and are the only feedstocks for which verification procedureswould be necessary. EPA recommends in andSection; 248.23(c)(1) that, shouldit be necessary to consult manufacturers' records for verification, recordsof other inqredients should not be reviewed in order to protect trade secrets.A commenter stated that verification of certifications would appear torequire special record keeping by manufacturers. Difficulties would beexperienced by multi-plant operations because recovered materials are notavailable in equal quantities to each plant. Products are sold to distributorsor wholesalers who then sell to procurement agencies. Certifications arerequested after the fact, so it would be difficult to track down recoveredmaterials in such cases. EPA again acknowledges that the Federal government does not have authorityunder section 6002 of RCRA to require information from manufacturers. However,there is a relatively simple voluntary method to overcome this difficulty.As products are commonly tracked by batch numbers, manufacturers can routinelyprovide their distributors with the percentage of recovered materials foreach batch. Not only would vendors and contractors have information onhand when preparing their offers, the verification process would becomestraightforward. When necessary, manufacturers could simply pull theirexisting records for the batch in question. Therefore, EPA has includedthis method as a recommendation to procuring agencies in andSection; 248.23(c)(3)of the final guideline. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Annual Review and Monitoring </ITAG>The fourth requirement of the affirmative procurement program is an annualreview and monitoring of the effectiveness of the program. EPA recommends that the review include an estimate of the quantity of buildinginsulation products purchased during the year, an assessment of the effectivenessof the agency promotion program, and an assessment of any remaining barriersto procurement of building insulation containing recovered materials. Inassessing barriers to procurement, procuring agencies should determinewhether they are internal or external. Internal barriers, such as resistanceto use of building insulation products containing recovered materials byagency personnel, without cause, can be corrected by the procuring agencies.External barriers, such as unavailability of building insulation productscontaining recovered materials, may well be beyond the agencies' control.EPA also believes that procuring agencies should review the range of estimatesand certifications of recovered materials content provided by vendors orcontractors during the year. Significant and repeated variations betweenthe procuring agency's standards and vendor's certifications and estimateswould signal whether changes in approach (e.g., from case-by-case to minimumcontent standards) or different minimum content standards are warranted.EPA further believes that information provided by the estimation requirementwill be particularly helpful to procuring agencies when they review theircompliance with the requirement to purchase building insulation productswith the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable. EPA has determined that one intent of the requirement that vendors or contractorsestimate the total percentage of recovered materials content is to provideinformation to procuring agencies that can be used in future procurements.Further, procuring agencies need to keep up-to-date on changes in recyclingpractices and availability of products containing recovered materials content.For these reasons, EPA believes that agencies should keep statistical recordsof building insulation product procurements to implement properly the intentof Congress in requiring an affirmative procurement program. A summaryof these records should be included in the annual review and monitoringof the effectiveness of the program. A program for gathering statistics need not be elaborate to be effective.However, agencies should monitor their procurements to provide data onthe following: (a) The percentages of recovered materials content in the products procuredor offered;(b) Comparative price information on competitive procurements; (c) The quantity of each item procured over a fiscal year; (d) The availability of the insulation products to procuring agencies;(e) Type of performance tests conducted, together with the categories ofbuilding insulation products containing recovered materials content thatfailed the tests, the percentage of total virgin products and productscontaining recovered materials content supplied that failed each test,and the nature of the failure; (f) Agency experience with the performance of the procured products. Rather than keep records of each test performed, procuring agencies shouldidentify the performance tests used and maintain records, by test, on thepercentage of failures by building insulation products containing recoveredmaterials content and on the nature of these failures. EPA recommends that each procuring agency prepare a report on its annualreview and monitoring of the effectiveness of its procurement program.If the agency is using the case-by-case approach, the report should discusshow that approach is maximizing the use of recovered materials contentas required by RCRA section 6002. If the minimum content standard approachis used, the agency should discuss whether the standard should be raised,lowered, or remain constant for each item. The discussion should be basedon reasonable determinations of price, quality, and availability as wellas a comparison of estimates and certifications provided by the vendorsor contractors. Agencies should also document their review of specificationsand list those which are revised each year. EPA notes that this guideline will apply to state and local procuring agencies,as explained above under ``Applicability.'' Information drawn from theexperience of Federal procuring agencies about purchases of building insulationproducts containing recovered materials would therefore be useful to stateand local purchasing officials. Accordingly, EPA encourages Federal procuringagencies to make their reports available to the public. Several commenters stressed the need for Federal procurement guidelinesto provide direction to state and local agencies which are waiting forleadership. Another commenter wondered why EPA encourages procuring agenciesto make their reports available to the public when they can already beobtained through the Freedom of Information Act. EPA recognizes that thereports would be available through such means but voluntary distributionby procuring agencies might speed the transfer of information. A commenter agreed with the proposed annual review and monitoring recommendationsand further suggested that procuring agencies provide their reports tothe Office of Federal Procurement Policy and to EPA to permit EPA to monitorthe program and consider revisions to the guideline. Valuable as thesesuggestions are, EPA has previously considered both options and concludedthat it has no authority under section 6002 to require or recommend thatprocuring agencies submit their reports to OFPP or to EPA. (EPA does planto monitor procuring agencies' implementation of the procurement guidelines.)Finally, EPA notes that while the annual review and monitoring requirementsof RCRA section 6002 apply to State and local procuring agencies and tocontractors, EPA's recommendation for recordkeeping and reporting is lesspertinent for these persons than for Federal agencies. Most EPA recommendationsare germane to implementing section 6002. In the case of the recordkeepingand reporting recommendations, however, the recommendations are more germaneto the Federal agencies, which are required to report to the Office ofFederal Procurement Policy regarding implementation of section 6002. Inaddition, reports generated by the Federal agencies are available to thepublic through Freedom of Information Act requests, and the experienceof Federal agencies will serve as an important teaching tool for non-Federalagencies trying to implement affirmative procurement programs. In the case of non-Federal procuring agencies and contractors, there isno reporting requirement in section 6002, and the Freedom of InformationAct does not extend to their documents (although there might be a similarstate provision). EPA believes that reporting is less relevant when thereport is unavailable unless the agency or contractor chooses to make itavailable. Therefore, EPA continues to recommend recordkeeping and reportingbut acknowledges that these recommendations do not apply equally to non-Federalagencies and contractors.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Price, Competition, Availability, and Performance</ITAG>As described above, section 6002(c)(1) of RCRA provides that a procuringagency may decide not to purchase an item designated by EPA if it determinesthat the item is available only at an unreasonable price, a satisfactorylevel of competition cannot be maintained, the item is not reasonably availablewithin a reasonable period of time, or the item fails to meet the agency'sreasonable performance standards. EPA has considered the effect of theselimitations on procurement of building insulation products containing recoveredmaterials.Commenters asked EPA to compile information on availability, relative price,and performance of building insulation products, including lists of manufacturers,price comparisons by products and regions, and performance tests; to distributethis information to state and local governments; and to sponsor seminarsto share this information with interested persons. EPA agrees that furtherguidance will need to be provided to procuring agencies and vendors regardingthe implementation of this as well as the other procurement guidelines.Therefore, the Agency will be developing a plan for educating the variousprocuring agencies and vendors. EPA also plans to establish informal, highlyavailable mechanisms to disseminate information, such as a telephone hotline.A. PriceSeveral factors will affect the market price, or bid price, of the designatedbuilding insulation products, including the availability and cost of recoveredmaterial feedstocks, transportation costs, and so on. Because these factorscan be site specific and are variable, EPA believes the best method ofdetermining the price is through the marketplace. Further, fluctuationin the overall economy affects the prices of individual building insulationproducts.In many cases, more that one type of insulation could be selected for aparticular installation. The different types of insulation do not competeon pricing alone; otherwise the least expensive insulation product wouldbe used in all instances. There is no purchasing history based on relativeprices of building insulation products made with virgin versus recoveredmaterial content. The only price comparison EPA could make is by type ofinsulation made with virgin materials or with recovered materials contentat a particular point in time. The price differences may be the resultof factors other than recovered material content, such as special additivesor features in one product as compared with another.Further, manufacturers have suggested that the use of recovered materialsrather than virgin materials rarely results in price differences. Celluloseand rock wool insulation are rarely available with primarily virgin content.Cellulose fiberboard and the polyisocyanurate/polyurethane rigid foamsare commonly, though not always, made with recovered materials. Price differencesbetween similar products are usually the result of factors unrelated tothe choice of virgin or recycled feedstocks. Commenters on several of EPA's procurement guidelines, including the proposedbuilding insulation products guideline, stated that the term ``reasonableprice'' as used in RCRA section 6002 refers to price preferences. EPA disagrees.As previously stated in the paper guideline, 53 FR 23559 (June 22, 1988),RCRA section 6002 does not provide explicit authority to EPA either toauthorize or to recommend payment of a price preference or use of set-asides.Therefore, unless an agency has an independent authority to provide a pricepreference or to create a set-aside, EPA believes that a price is ``unreasonable''if it is greater than the price of a competing product made of virgin material.However, it should be borne in mind that, when product specifications requirea recovered material content, there is no way to guarantee that every itemprocured under those specifications was procured at a price no greaterthan the price that would have been paid in the absence of those specifications.On the contrary, EPA expects that there will be fluctuations in price inboth directions. Therefore, EPA interprets the reasonable price provisionof RCRA section 6002(c)(1)(C) for those specifications to mean that thereis no projected or observed long-term or average increase over the priceof comparable virgin items.A commenter stated that when minimum content standards are used, the productspecified by the procuring agency is a different product from one madeentirely from virgin materials and that, therefore, any price comparisonbetween the two is irrelevant. EPA does not agree that the price of a virginproduct is irrelevant. Since price is one of the factors used in settingminimum content standards, procuring agencies should monitor prices todetermine whether the standards should be revised. A long-term (e.g., oneyear) increase over the price of a comparable virgin product might be anindication that the minimum content standard is inappropriate.Finally, a commenter disagreed with EPA's interpretation of ``unreasonable''and noted that the legislative materials upon which EPA relies for thisinterpretation post-date by several years the original enactment of RCRA,do not indicate any intention on the part of Congress that section 6002only apply in the rare situation of a tie bid, and only refer to recycledpaper. This commenter raised the same concern in commenting on the proposedretread tires guideline; EPA responded to it in the final retread tiresguideline as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">While the commenter has correctly characterized the legislative materials,EPA disagrees that one should thus conclude that Congress intended forprocuring agencies to pay a premium price for products procured pursuantto section 6002. EPA believes that if Congress had meant to authorize pricepremiums, then Congress would have explicitly said so in section 6002 and/orthe legislative history. In the absence of this explicit authority, EPAcan neither require nor recommend that procuring agencies pay a premiumprice. 53 FR 46569 (November 17, 1988).</ITAG>EPA continues to believe that section 6002 does not authorize price premiums.B. Competition EPA recommends that determinations of ``satisfactory'' competition be madein accordance with Federal procurement law. For example, 48 CFR Part l4,Sealed Bidding, allows for award of bids even when a small number of bidshave been received; see 48 CFR 14.407-1. ln the case of negotiated contracts,48 CFR 15.804-3(b) provides that, for purposes of waiving the requirementfor cost and pricing data, competition exists if offers are solicited;two or more responsible offerors that can satisfy the Government's requirementssubmit price offers responsive to the solicitations's expressed requirements;and these offerors compete independently for a contract to be awarded tothe responsible offeror submitting the lowest evaluated price. EPA believes that, in most cases, the number of manufacturers for the designatedtypes of building insulation products is sufficient to assure competitivebidding. Further, many vendors are able to offer products from a singlemanufacturer. In those cases where a building insulation product is madeby only one company, there still should be sufficient competition amongvendors. EPA does not foresee insufficient competition for building insulationproducts made with recovered materials content. If a lack of competitionresults because of the recommended minimum content standards, EPA recommendsthat procuring agencies re-evaluate the minimum content standards. C. Availability EPA believes that the building insulation products designated in the guidelinepromulgated today are currently available with recovered materials contentin each of the following insulation categories: cellulose loose-fill, perlitecomposite board, rock wool, polyurethane/polyisocyanurate rigid foam-in-placeand board, glass fiber reinforced polyisocyanurate/polyurethane rigid foam,and phenolic rigid foam. Although statistics on recovered material feedstockuse have not been gathered for any type of building insulation product,both manufacturers and suppliers of recyclable feedstocks have indicatedthe flow of recovered materials into the insulation industries. Fiberglassinsulation made with recovered cullet is not consistently available, andpolystyrene insulation made with recovered materials is only in the developmentalstages. If building insulation products containing recovered materials are notavailable, then procuring agencies are not required to buy them <T3>at that time. </T3>Procuring agencies are required to continue to promotetheir affirmative procurement programs, however, in order to encourageavailability. In addition, as discussed previously, procuring agenciesare required to review procurement practices and revise such practicesif they discourage the availability of building insulation products containingrecovered materials. Commenters requested that EPA list manufacturers of building insulationmade with recovered materials in the guideline. EPA believes that it isinappropriate to do so. Because the list would require constant updating,EPA believes that other, less formal, highly available mechanisms for providingthis information should be used. As noted above, EPA plans to establishsuch mechanisms for disseminating this and other information, includinga telephone hotline. In addition, EPA has placed in the docket for thisguideline a document entitled <T3>Insulating Material Types and Manufacturers, </T3>which contains listsof manufacturers of building insulation products. This document has beenamended to include additional manufacturers that were suggested by commenters.EPA has been informed that a national directory of recycled products willbe published shortly which is being designed to keep such lists up-to-dateand make them widely available. Several commenters stated that, if procurement officers conclude that fiberglassinsulation products are not included in the guideline, serious materialshortages and scheduling delays would result. These commenters appear torefer to supplies of the other competing building insulation products.None of the commenters offered facts to support this position. EPA notes,however, that procuring agencies must base their decision not to procurean item made with recovered materials on the statutory criteria, whichinclude unavailability within a reasonable period of time. New types of insulation products may become available with recovered materialscontent. Procuring agencies can identify such new products and adaptationsto existing products as they monitor new developments. These additionalproducts must be included in the preference program as they become available.D. Performance In general, performance standards for building insulation products havebeen established without regard to the kind of feedstocks used. Manufacturershave indicated that the use of recovered materials rather than virgin feedstocksdoes not affect the performance of the insulation product in question.Performance is determined by other factors. Standard industry specificationsfor all but cellulose loose-fill insulation neither allow nor disallowrecovered material content; cellulose loose-fill insulation specificallymentions that the basic material is to be recycled. In many other typesof insulation products, recovered material is commonly used. Therefore,EPA does not believe that product performance should be an issue of concernto procuring agencies. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Implementation </ITAG>Different parts of section 6002 refer to different dates by which procuringagencies must have completed or initiated a required activity: (1) May8, 1986 (i.e., 18 months after enactment of HSWA), (2) one year after thedate of publication of an EPA guideline, and (3) the date specified inan EPA guideline. As a result, there is some confusion with respect towhich activities must be completed or initiated by each date. This sectionof the preamble explains these requirements. First, under section 6002(d)(1), Federal agencies that have the responsibilityfor drafting or reviewing specifications for procurement items were toeliminate from such specifications any exclusion of recovered materialsand any requirements that items be manufactured from virgin materials.This activity was to be completed by May 8, 1986. Second, Federal agencies must assure that their specifications for procurementitems designated by EPA require the use of recovered materials to the maximumextent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item (section6002(d)(2)). In addition, procuring agencies must develop an affirmativeprocurement program for purchasing designated items, in this instance,building insulation products (section 6002(i)(1)). Both of these activitiesmust be completed within one year after the date of publication of thisguideline as a final rule. Third, procuring agencies which procure items designated by EPA must procuresuch items containing the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable(section 6002(c)(1)). They also must revise their specifications for buildinginsulation products to assure that they can procure such items containingthe highest percentage of recovered materials practicable (section 6002(c)(1)).In addition, contracting officers must require vendors or contractors tosubmit estimates and certifications of recovered materials content (section6002(c)(3)). These activities must begin after the date specified by EPAin the applicable guideline. EPA believes that procuring agencies shouldbegin to procure the designated products as soon as the affirmative procurementprograms have been developed. Because the programs must be completed withinone year after publication of this guideline as a final rule, affirmativeprocurement should begin no later than one year from publication as well.Section 248.26 specifies this implementation date. EPA expects cooperation from affected procuring agencies in implementingthis guideline. Under section 6002(g) of RCRA, the Office of Federal ProcurementPolicy (OFPP), in cooperation with EPA, is responsible for overseeing implementationof the requirements of section 6002 and for coordinating it with otherFederal procurement policies. OFPP is required to report to Congress onactions taken by Federal agencies to implement section 6002.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Summary of Supporting Analyses </ITAG>A. General Four background documents were prepared for EPA and have been placed inthe docket: for the proposed guideline: <T3>Feasibility of a Federal Procurement Guideline for Recovered Materialsin Insulation Products </T3>(E.H. Pechan andamp; Associates, Inc., February1988), <T3>Insulating Material Types and Manufacturers </T3>(E.H. Pechan andamp;Associates, Inc., June 1988), <T3>Energy and Economic Impacts of the Proposed Guideline for Procurementof Building Insulation Products Containing Recovered Materials </T3>(E.H.Pechan andamp; Associates, Inc., June 1988), and <T3>Industry and Regulatory Information, Background Document for FinalInsulation Procurement Guideline, </T3>(E.H. Pechan andamp; Associates, Inc.,February 1989). B. Environmental Impacts The principal environmental impacts concern chlorofluorocarbons in plasticrigid foams and the possible risk of durable fibers. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Chlorofluorocarbons </ITAG>Recently, questions have been raised regarding the environmental consequencesof use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the manufacture of various items.One of the types of insulation covered by the proposed guideline, rigidplastic foams, contain CFCs. Ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere has created environmental concerns.Fully halogenated CFCs are the primary suspects for causing substantialozone depletion. EPA published a final rule on Protection of StratosphericOzone (40 CFR Part 82) on August 12, 1988 (53 FR 30566). The regulations(1) will reduce consumption of CFCs and halons, (2) are intended to reducethe release of CFCs and halons to the atmosphere, and (3) will implementthe Montreal protocols. As of July l, 1989, manufacture of CFCs are frozenat 1986 production levels. CFCs are now a key ingredient of PIR/PU, extruded PS, and phenolic rigidfoam insulations. PIR/PU rigid foam insulation uses CFC-11 (fluorotrichloromethane).Extruded PS foam insulation is manufactured with CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane).CFCs are used as a supplementary blowing agent and are retained withinthe closed insulation cells. CFCs have good thermal insulation propertiesand contribute significantly to the high R-values of the rigid foam insulations.Use of CFCs in closed cell foams has changed the emissions scenario fromone of quick release (such as aerosol propellants) to a steady, very longterm release. Industry sources have informally suggested that the halflives of CFCs in one-inch thick un-clad polyisocyanurate foam boards range75 to 150 years. Expandable foam polystyrene (EPS) is not made with CFCs. Instead, hydrocarbonssuch as pentane are used as blowing agents. R-values for equivalent thicknessesof EPS when compared with extruded polystyrene are said to be lower. Insulation, by nature, is installed in the broadest range of building applicationsand geographies. Therefore, release of CFCs cannot be effectively controlled.Continued, and increasing use of CFCs in PIR/PU and extruded PS insulationas market share grows would effectively create a bank of CFCs slowly beingreleased throughout the environment. In 1988, a substitute for CFC-11 and CFC-12 was announced, with commercialavailability expected in 1991. One commenter stated that the compatibilityof new blowing agents with the polyols in current use has not yet beencompletely evaluated and may have an effect on the aims of the guideline.However, EPA has received no information that a problem will, in fact,arise. As there are already provisions in the guideline that allow procuringagencies to respond when building insulation products become unavailablewith recovered material content, EPA believes it is premature to changethe minimum content standards at this time. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Possible Risk of Durable Fibers </ITAG>One commenter expressed concern about possible health: effects of man mademineral fibers. The EPA Office of Toxic Substances is examining the hazardsand exposures associated with durable fibers in detail. Therefore, as theissues are being addressed elsewhere and do not apply uniquely to productswith recovered material content, EPA does not believe that it is necessaryto address the possible risk of durable fibers in this guideline. C. Energy Impacts The primary energy impact of insulation is energy conservation as morebuildings are insulated more efficiently. The use of recovered materialsin the insulation products would not affect insulation or R-values. The use of glass cullet rather than virgin materials in fiberglass insulationhas been said to reduce energy consumption in fiberglass manufacture. DMTwaste bottoms have been said to be burned to recover energy value if theyare not recovered to produce products like insulation polyols. Data regardingquantities and potential energy impacts were not available. EPA receivedcomments on the energy savings in theoretical batches of fiberglass insulationwhich contributed to changes in earlier sections of the guideline. However,no comments were received regarding industry-wide impacts. No commentswere received regarding DMT waste bottoms used in polyols. EPA believesthat energy consumption will not increase due to this guideline; ratherit will decrease though not by significant amounts. D. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation ismajor or nonmajor. The proposed guideline is not a major rule because itis unlikely to result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA does not believe that this guideline will result in higher prices northat adverse effects throughout the economy will result. In fact, the guidelinemay stimulate employment, competition, investment, productivity, innovationand United States enterprises may be able to compete more effectively withforeign based counterparts that are importing recovered materials. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewas required by Executive Order 12291. E. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., wheneveran agency publishes a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed orfinal rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatoryflexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities(i.e., small businesses, small organizations, small governmental jurisdictions),unless the Administrator certifies that the rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As described in the environmental, energy, and economic impact document,the economic impact on both small businesses and small governmental jurisdictionsis expected to be in some cases, negligible and in other instances, beneficial.An extremely limited number of business and governmental entities are affectedat all by the guideline. For the above reasons, EPA certifies that the final rule is not expectedto have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. As a result, the guideline does not require a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 248 </ITAG>Commercial item descriptions, Government procurement, Insulation, MilitarySpecifications, Postconsumer materials, Recovered materials, Recycling,Resource recovery.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jack Moore,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Administrator.</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 40 of the Code of FederalRegulations is amended by adding a new Part 248 reading as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 248_GUIDELINE FOR FEDERAL PROCUREMENT OF BUILDING INSULATIONPRODUCTS CONTAINING RECOVERED MATERIALS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.2 Designation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.3 Applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.4 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Specifications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.10 Revisions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.11 Recommendations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Affirmative Procurement Program </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.20 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.21 Preference program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.22 Promotion program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.23 Estimates, certification, and verification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.24 Annual review and monitoring. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">248.25 Implementation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 6912(a) and 6962. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose. </ITAG>(a) The purpose of this guideline is to assist procuring agencies in complyingwith the requirements of section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act,as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or the Act),as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6962, as that section applies to procurement of buildinginsulation products designated in andSection; 248.2 of this part.

The term includes spray-applied and injected applications.(mm) ``Wall insulation'' means a material, primarily designed to resistheat flow, which is installed within or on the walls between conditionedareas of a building and unconditioned areas of a building or the outside,as well as common wall assemblies between separately conditioned unitsin multiple unit structures. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Specifications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Revisions. </ITAG>(a) Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewingspecifications for procurement items procured by Federal agencies wererequired to revise their specifications, by May 8, 1986, to eliminate anyexclusion of recovered materials and any requirement that items be manufacturedfrom virgin materials. (b) Within one year after the effective date of this guideline, each procuringagency must assure that its specifications for building insulation productsrequire the use of recovered materials to the maximum extent possible withoutjeopardizing the intended end use of these items. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.11 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Recommendations. </ITAG>(a) Procuring agencies should continue to reference Commercial Item Descriptionsor appropriate standards when purchasing building insulation products,after such Commercial Item Descriptions and industry standards (and specificationswhich are referenced) have been reviewed to be certain that the use ofrecovered materials is allowed. (b) Procuring agencies should include minimum content standards or substantiallyequivalent methods to prefer recovered materials content in their invitationsfor bids and requests for proposals when purchasing building insulationproducts or causing the purchase of building insulation products in anycontract. (c) If a procuring agency determines that a building insulation productcontaining recovered materials cannot meet reasonable performance standards,then the agency can exclude the product on a case-by-case basis. Procuringagencies should document such determinations, and the documentation shouldreference the particular tests used to judge performance. Procuring agenciesshould also reference such documentation in subsequent solicitations forthe specific item to avoid repetition of previously documented findings.(d)(1) Procuring agencies should assure that language in new specificationsfor new building insulation products, and for existing products which areintroduced with recovered materials content, allow recovered materialscontent. Methods to monitor the introduction of new or adapted productsare detailed in andSection;andSection; 248.21 and 248.24 of this part. (2) As new building insulation products containing or capable of containingrecovered materials are identified, minimum content standards or equivalentpreferences for recovered material content should be inserted in invitationsfor bids and requests for proposals whenever such products could be offered.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Affirmative Procurement Program </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.20 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General. </ITAG>Within one year after the date of publication of this guideline as a finalrule, each procuring agency which procures building insulation productsmust establish an affirmative program for procuring such items containingrecovered materials to the maximum extent practicable. The program mustmeet the requirements of section 6002(i) of RCRA, including the establishmentof a preference program; a promotion program; procedures for obtainingestimates and certification of recovered materials content and for verifyingthe estimates and certifications; and an annual review and monitoring program.This subpart provides recommendations for implementing section 6002(i).Note that a procuring agency's responsibility to procure building insulationproducts containing recovered materials to the maximum extent practicableis not negated when the agency contracts with another person to specifyor to supply the products. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Preference program. </ITAG>(a)(1) EPA recommends that procuring agencies establish minimum recoveredmaterial content standards for building insulation products commerciallyavailable with recovered materials content, subject to the limitationsdescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c) of this section, so as to achieveprocurement of building insulation products containing recovered materialsto the maximum extent practicable. (2) In accordance with RCRA section 6002(i), EPA recommends the establishmentof minimum postconsumer recovered paper content standards for buildinginsulation products made with cellulose fiber.(3) EPA recommends that minimum content standards: (i) Be based on insulation material type, (ii) Be based on the weight of component parts, (iii) Refer only to the core insulation material and exclude from considerationany facing, binding, or other materials surrounding or attached to thecore, and (iv) Include any insulation material that is used in composite products.(4) EPA recommends that the following minimum content standards be used:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s100,r25 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Recommended Minimum Content Standards for Insulation </T4><H1>Material type </H1><H1>Percent by weight</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cellulose loose-fill and spray-on <D>75 percent postconsumer recovered paper </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perlite composite board <D>23 percent postconsumer recovered paper </D></ITAG>Plastic rigid foam, polyisocyanurate/polyurethane: <ITAG tagnum="3">Rigid foam </ITAG><D>9 percent recovered material </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Foam-in-place </ITAG><D>5 percent recovered material </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Glass fiber reinforced </ITAG><D>6 percent recovered material </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenolic rigid foam <D>5 percent recovered material </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rock wool <D>50 percent recovered material</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="20"/><T4>Note._</T4>The minimum content standards are based on the weight ofmaterial (not volume) in the insulating core only.(5) EPA recommends that procuring agencies revise their minimum contentstandards as necessary to reflect current market availability of buildinginsulation containing recovered materials. (6) EPA recommends that procuring agencies which have established minimumcontent standards in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section usethe following approach in the design phase when it is contemplated thatthe agency will contract for construction, alteration, or repair of buildings,where the contractor will be required to supply building insulation products:(i) Place an affirmative responsibility upon the ``designing architect''(i.e., the architect or engineer, whether an employee or contractor, whois responsible for project design) to include as a design considerationthe public policy preference for the use of building insulation productscontaining recovered materials. (ii) Require that the designing architect select the type of building insulationto be procured. If more than one type of insulation which meets the agency'sminimum content standards is suitable, the type with the highest minimumcontent standard should be preferred. (iii) Require that the designing architect justify in writing the architect'sselection of building insulation types not on the procuring agency's minimumcontent standards list and review these justifications to assure that theyare consistent with RCRA section 6002. When the designing architect choosesa type of building insulation for which the procurinq agency has not establisheda minimum content standard, the procuring agency should use the proceduresdescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. (iv) Require that the designing architect determine whether the selectedtypes of building insulation are practicably available in products thatmeet the procuring agency's minimum content standards and further requirethat, if the designing architect determines that the selected buildinginsulation products are not practicably available in products that meetthe procuring agency's minimum content standards, the architect must advisethe procuring agency in writing as to the recovered materials content thatis practicably available. (v) If the selected type of building insulation is available in productsthat meet the procuring agency's minimum content standards, specify inits solicitation the type(s) of building insulation required and the minimumrecovered materials content established by the procuring agency in accordancewith paragraph (a)(1) of this section for that type of insulation. (vi) If the type of building insulation selected is not practicably availablein products that meet the procuring agency's minimum content standards,specify in its solicitation the type(s) of insulation required and a minimumrecovered materials content for that insulation equal to the percentageof recovered materials content that is practicably available. (b) EPA recommends that procuring agencies use the case-by-case approachfor individual procurements of insulation when the procuring agency hasnot established a minimum content standard for the type of insulation tobe procured. Further, EPA recommends that procuring agencies document anydecisions to procure such products to assure that the decision is consistentwith RCRA section 6002. (1) In the case of invitations for bid (IFBs), EPA recommends that procuringagencies give preference to bidders offering to supply building insulationproducts containing recovered materials; and that all other things beingequal, the bidder offering the highest percentage of recovered materialbe awarded the contract. (2) In the case of requests for proposal (RFPs), EPA recommends that procuringagencies include as an evaluation factor for award, a criterion which rewardsthe offeror for the quantity of recovered material in building insulationproducts offered. (c) The recommendations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as wellas any other substantially equivalent preference program that an agencymay adopt, are subject to the following limitations listed in section 6002(c)(1)of RCRA: (1) Unsatisfactory level of competition; (2) Unavailability within a reasonable period of time; (3) Inability to meet the performance standards in the applicable specifications;(4) Unavailability at a reasonable price. (d) Procuring agencies must examine their procurement policies and procedures(exclusive of published regulations) and eliminate those which would inhibitor preclude the purchase of building insulation products containing recoveredmaterials.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Promotion program. </ITAG>EPA recommends that procuring agencies use the following methods, at aminimum, to promote their preference programs: (a) Place a statement in procurement solicitations, in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily, </T3>or in similar publications describingthe preference program. (b) Describe the preference program in solicitations for or which includebuilding insulation. (c) Discuss the preference program at bidders' conferences. (d) Inform industry trade associations about the preference program. (e) Publicize preferences for building insulation products made with recoveredmaterials in all product-related information services and publications(e.g., Department of Housing and Urban Development publications and product-relatedservices developed in compliance with section 521 of the National HousingAct, such as: National Building Codes, Bulletins, Materials Releases, EngineeringBulletins, and Use of Materials Information). (f) Issue press releases describing the affirmative procurement programto recycling industry, architectural, and building trade publications.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.23 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Estimates, certification, and verification. </ITAG>Each procuring agency must develop estimation, certification and verificationprocedures: (a) When a vendor supplies a building insulation product, the contractingofficer must require the vendor to estimate the total percentage of recoveredmaterial contained in that insulation product. EPA recommends that procuringagencies maintain records of these estimates for three years by type ofproduct, quantity purchased, and price paid. (b)(1) When a procurement solicitation requires a minimum recovered materialscontent, contracting officers must require that contractors certify, priorto delivery or installation, that the building insulation products suppliedunder the contract meet or exceed the minimum content standard set forthin the solicitation. (2) When using the case-by-case approach, contracting officers must requirecontractors to certify, prior to delivery or installation, that the buildinginsulation products supplied meet or exceed the minimum percentage of recoveredmaterials offered by the contractor in response to the solicitation. (c)(1) EPA recommends that procuring agencies develop verification proceduresfor certifications and estimates of recovered materials content in buildinginsulation products that require access only to manufacturers' recordsof recovered materials and comparable virgin materials used in each batch.Verification need not include review of records of other ingredients, whichcould include confidential business information. (2) EPA recommends that the average of recovered materials used in a specificinsulation product over a one-month period be used, if necessary, for verificationof estimates of recovered materials content actually utilized in insulationproducts supplied to a procuring agency. (3) EPA recommends that procuring agencies encourage their contractorsto obtain the percentage of recovered material content, by batch number,from the manufacturer on a routine basis. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.24 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Annual review and monitoring. </ITAG>(a) Each procuring agency must conduct an annual review and monitoringof the effectiveness of its affirmative procurement program. (b) EPA recommends that the annual review include the following items:(1) An estimate of the quantity of building insulation with recovered materialcontent purchased and the total quantity of building insulation productspurchased. (2) An assessment of the effectiveness of the promotion program. (3) An assessment of any remaining barriers to purchase of insulation withrecovered content to determine whether they are internal (e.g., resistanceto use) or external (e.g., unavailability). (4) A review of the range of estimates and certifications of recoveredmaterials content in building insulation products provided by vendors duringthe year to determine whether minimum content standards should be raisedor lowered, or whether a change from the case-by-case approach to the minimumcontent standard approach is necessary. (5) A program to gather statistics. Procuring agencies should monitor theirprocurements to provide data on the following: (i) The percentages of recovered materials content in the products procuredor offered; (ii) Comparative price information on competitive procurements; (iii) The quantity of each item procured over a fiscal year; (iv) The availability of the insulation products to procuring agencies;(v) Type of performance tests conducted, together with the type of buildinginsulation product containing recovered materials content that failed thetests, the percentages of total virgin products and products containingrecovered materials content supplied that failed each test, and the natureof the failure; (vi) Agency experience with the performance of the procured products. (c) Procuring agencies should prepare a report on their annual review andmonitoring of the effectiveness of their procurement programs and makethese reports available to the public. The reports should contain the followinginformation: (1) If the case-by-case approach or a substantially equivalent alternativeis being used, a discussion of how the procuring agency's approach procuresbuilding insulation products containing recovered materials to the maximumextent practicable. The basis for this discussion should be a review ofthe data compiled on recovered materials content, price, availability,and performance, as well as a comparison of estimates and certificationsprovided by the vendors. (2) If the minimum content standards approach is being used, a discussionof whether the minimum content standards in use should be raised, lowered,or remain constant for each item. The basis for this discussion shouldbe a review of the data compiled on recovered materials content, price,availability, and performance, as well as a comparison of estimates andcertifications provided by the vendors. (3) Documentation of specification revisions made during the year. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 248.25 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Implementation. </ITAG>(a) Federal agencies were required to review and revise their specificationsfor procurement items by May 8, 1986.
