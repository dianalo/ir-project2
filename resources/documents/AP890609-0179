Leaders of the two sides said the accord would take effect whenPresident Ramsewak Shankar signs it. The president's office had noimmediate comment.   Negotiators said agreement was reached Thursday after two days oftalks in neighboring French Guiana between delegations from theNational Assembly and the Jungle Commando, the main rebel group.   They said among the conditions for a permanent trace are theabolishment of a state of emergency in effect since Dec. 1, 1986, ineastern and southern Suriname, where the guerrilla war isconcentrated, and measures guaranteeing administrativerepresentation to the region's Bush Negroes.   Most rebels are Bush Negroes, an ethnic minority of about 50,000people in this former Dutch colony with a population of 400,000 onthe northeastern shoulder of South America.   Rebels led by former army sergeant Ronnie Brunswijk have beenfighting to overthrow Suriname's military-backed government since1986. They initially demanded the removal of former junta leader andarmy commander Desi Bouterse but continued the insurgency afterBouterse stepped down to allow elections in November 1987.   Bouterse retained his army command after the election and isregarded as a behind-the-scenes power broker.   The National Assembly took the initiative for negotiations withthe Jungle Commando after several attempts by the government failed.   National Assembly Chairman Jaggernath Lachmon told reporters inParamaribo that during the talks Brunswijk welcomed an amnestygranted to the rebels by the assembly a week ago.   Last week government troops attacked about 40 rebels who seized ahydroelectric plant 125 miles south of the capital and threatened toblow it up. Four soldiers and several rebels were wounded before theguerrillas withdrew.   Lachmon reported Brunswijk said he had not ordered the takeoverof the plant and he told the rebels to withdraw to improve thechances for successful peace negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
