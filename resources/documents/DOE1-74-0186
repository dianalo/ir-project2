Both the communal carotid arteries andthe carotid bifurcations were sufficiently assessable in the B-imagein 95%. Safe image diagnosis of the internal carotid arteries was possiblein 82% only. Proximal formation of steps (40%) and stenoses of the externalcarotid artery (43%) were found most frequently. Only 4 cases revealeddiscrepancies to DSA findings. Duplex scanning should not be performeduntil a fortnight after operation due to soft tissue swellings. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
