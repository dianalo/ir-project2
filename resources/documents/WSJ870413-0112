William Proxmire (D., Wis.) has become the chief knight-errant of the Business Roundtable. His damsels are yesteryear's fat cats endangered by today's corporate reformers.    This alliance of liberal pols and big business against corporate raiders is pushing several bills to stymie takeovers. Proposals are wending through Congress, but Sen. Proxmire has already shown his hand.    In February and March, he asked Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad to get him some bizarre information from investment banks and arbitrage firms. He asked for their gross revenue and net profits from arbitrage activity for the past three years, arbitrage's portion of total revenues and income, the &quot;total compensation for the five highest paid&quot; arbs and &quot;the total compensation of the highest paid individual.&quot;    Asking banks for revenues and profits is like seeking Coca-Cola's secret formula. Bankers would love to know how their competitors are doing, but not at the cost of releasing their own proprietary trading. Some houses, such as Goldman, Sachs, remain private partnerships. Even the publicly owned firms have no obligation to disclose such information. The demand for the income of specific individuals takes some gall.    The bankers hoped Mr. Shad would call off Sen. Proxmire's fishing expedition. Instead Mr. Shad had an SEC staffer write the New York Stock Exchange, which sent the demands to the banks. Several banks threatened to defy the regulators, but no one wanted to risk the ire of the SEC (which must approve underwritings) or Sen. Proxmire.    So a group of investment bankers spent last week brokering a deal. They met with staffers on Sen. Proxmire's Banking Committee. They agreed that the NYSE would collect the information from the banks, then &quot;sanitize&quot; it by adding up the profits and salaries and lumping them all together to protect anonymity.    This exercise has caused a lot of grief on Wall Street, and will prove nothing. Sen. Proxmire will offer up headlines along the lines of &quot;Arbitragers Make Billions in 'Illicit' Profits.&quot; But in fact, as a study by the SEC's economist showed, stock trading before announced tender offers depends on newspaper rumors, whether the deal was friendly or not, and the foothold position of the acquirer.    What's especially ironic is that the biggest boost ever to the arbs occurred the last time politicians set out to protect target managers. The Williams Act of 1976 forced acquirers to stop buying stock on the open market once they had 5%. Since they can no longer acquire control by themselves, they must rely on arbs to get big blocks of stock. This increases the opportunities for the Ivan Boeskys to get news of impending takeovers worth stealing. Now Sen. Proxmire wants to make acquirers disclose their plans even sooner, at 3%.    Sen. Proxmire has a choice. He can chill takeovers by attacking the raiders, but this will mean more business for his dreaded arbs. Or he can help revoke the Williams Act, which will lower a defense shield for target managers and halt big opportunities for insider trading. Knight William should reconsider who are the damsels, and who are the dragons. </TEXT></DOC>
