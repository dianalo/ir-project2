Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN GOVMT SB FBC MER </CO><IN> BNK </IN><TEXT>   Federal regulators are expected to issue a statement as early as this week intended to reassure nervous Wall Street firms who have lent more than $10 billion to the thrift unit of deeply troubled Financial Corp. of America, Wall Street executives said.    The exact wording of the statement remains uncertain because the three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board haven't met to discuss it. However, based on discussions with Bank Board staff members and a draft circulated last week, officials of several Wall Street firms said the statement is likely to be much narrower than the letters of support former Bank Board chairman Edwin J. Gray issued to Financial Corp. in 1986 and 1987.    Mr. Gray's promise to take no action against Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. or its American Savings andamp; Loan Association unit because of American's failure to meet capital requirements expires March 31.    The Wall Street firms want some indication from the Bank Board that it endorses the firms' lending and won't stop them from liquidating the securities they hold as collateral if American Savings defaults on any of its obligations under the loans. The loans, known as reverse repurchase agreements, are secured by mortgage-backed securities whose value is about 5% more than the loan amount and usually have maturities of less than 30 days.    A Bank Board spokesman said the board might make a statement on the issue next week, but he declined to discuss its contents.    In the past two weeks, Bank Board staff members have met in New York with officials from Wall Street firms that are lenders to American Savings. At the most recent meeting last Thursday, the Bank Board staff members presented a draft statement that specifically addressed the issue of reverse repurchase lending to American Savings, Wall Street officials said.    If the Bank Board issues a statement limited to the issue of reverse repurchase agreements, it will have much more freedom to take actions against Financial Corp. that could dilute or eliminate the ownership of Financial Corp. shareholders, Wall Street officials said. Many thrift-industry executives believe that Mr. Gray limited his flexibility in dealing with Financial Corp.'s problems by issuing letters of broad support for the company.    Some Wall Street officials believe that the Bank Board will issue a statement covering reverse repurchase agreements to all thrifts, rather than just American Savings. However, several Wall Street officials who attended last Thursday's meeting said the Bank Board staff members seemed inclined to limit the statement to American Savings.    Among other things, the Bank Board doesn't want to tie its hands in dealing with dozens of troubled thrifts in Texas and other Southwestern states, Wall Street officials said. The Bank Board may simply leave in place a 1984 statement in which it said that if regulators take over a failed thrift they won't stop a reverse repurchase lender from liquidating its collateral except in cases of &quot;fraud or other similarly extraordinary circumstances.&quot;    Officials of some Wall Street firms had worried that, in a crisis, the Bank Board might decide to invoke the &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; exception for loans to American Savings because the thrift is so large. With more than $30 billion in assets, American Savings was until recently the nation's largest thrift. It is now second in size to the Home Savings unit of Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., which has about $36.5 billion in assets.    Wall Street sources said that to put pressure on the Bank Board to act, some firms last month began cutting back on the size of their loans to American Savings. The sources wouldn't identify the firms that took such actions.    William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp. and American Savings, declined to comment on whether any Wall Street dealers reduced their lending last month. However, he said, &quot;The dealers wanted the matter resolved and they applied pressure to get it resolved, and I don't care to discuss how that manifested itself.&quot;    Major Wall Street lenders to American Savings, as identified in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, include units of Salomon Inc.; First Boston Corp.; Goldman, Sachs and Co.; and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. The firms declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
