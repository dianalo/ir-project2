The list includes broad areas of materials processing,manufacturing, computers, biotechnology, aeronautics andenergy technology that have been the subject of previousgovernment and industry reports. But what sets this reportapart, technology experts say, is the imprimatur of the WhiteHouse, which in the past has blocked federal endeavors toadvance commercial technology because it considers that anintrusion in the marketplace.</LP><TEXT>   The report was prepared by the White House's office ofscience and technology policy in response to a provision inthe defense authorization act pushed by Sen. Jeff Bingaman(D., N.M.). For years, congressional Democrats have beenpushing the Reagan and Bush administrations without muchsuccess to increase funding for commercial technologies. Butin the past year, that resistance has started to crumble asthe administration has backed a $150 million plan for thenext fiscal year to boost supercomputers.   Partly, the change reflects the growing concern in theadministration that the U.S. is slipping in its competitionwith Japan and Europe. But the move also reflects a belief inthe administration that it is ideologically acceptable toinvest in technologies deemed &quot;pre-competitive&quot; -- even ifthose investments benefit specific industries.   The ideological change, though, is often more style thansubstance. The White House report singles out&quot;high-definition imaging and displays&quot; as critical, forinstance, because that is an important feature in a host ofelectronics. Early in the Bush administration, though, theWhite House bitterly fought any funding for &quot;high-definitiontelevision&quot; because it was seen as a handout to the dyingU.S. television industry.   &quot;We've gotten around the arguments about industrialpolicy,&quot; said Robert Stern, a Washington technologyconsultant. &quot;This shows a serious White House involvement intrying to make us competitive in technologies.&quot;   A group representing large businesses and researchuniversities, the Council on Competitiveness, has been urgingthe federal government to increase funding for commercialtechnologies in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 1992. TheWhite House report will undoubtedly boost those efforts, butgiven the continuing budget pressures, it's unclear whetherthe administration will support big increases. The Council onCompetitiveness said the administration could find the extrafunds by redirecting research funds from the military and bigscience projects.   The White House report selected the following technologiesas critical: materials processing; electronic and photonicmaterials; ceramics; composites; high-performance metals andalloys; computer-integrated manufacturing; intelligentprocessing equipment; micro-fabrication; systems managementtechniques; software; microelectronics and optoelectronics;high-performance computing and networking; high-definitiondisplays; sensors and signal processing; data storage;computer simulation; applied molecular biology; medicaltechnology; aeronautics; surface transportation; energy; andpollution remediation.   Many of the technologies have already been highlighted bythe Council of Competitiveness and similar reports by theCommerce and Defense departments. But the White House reportemphasizes technologies dealing with surface transportation,energy and environment more than the other governmentreports.   Separately, a federal semiconductor committee also plansto announce a joint effort with the White House science andtechnology policy office to prepare a plan to acceleratedevelopment of memory chips used in high-performancecomputers.</TEXT></DOC>
