Israeli warplanes raided Palestinian guerrilla bases in themountains south of Beirut, and newspapers said Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz may return to the Middle East early next month topromote the U.S. peace plan. The raid came a day after rocketslanded in northern Israel, causing light damage.   Authorities increased restrictions in the occupied territories,which already include travel bans and a cut-off of telephoneservice to the outside. A military official said must get approvalto bring $1,000 or more from neighboring Jordan, where most holdcitizenship and have family.   The rules are intended to hamper the Palestine LiberationOrganization in organizing and financing the protests.   Trials beginning Thursday involved the burial alive of fourArabs by an army bulldozer Feb. 5 in Kfar Salem, a West Bankvillage, and the beating Feb. 24 of two Palestinians near Nablus,which was photographed by a CBS News crew.   Neighbors soon rescued the buried Palestinians. The beating wastelevised around the world and aroused international protest.   Several weeks after trouble began in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip, the army introduced a policy of beating rioters as analternative to firing live ammunition. At least 100 Palestinianshave been killed in more than three months of violence, andhundreds wounded.   Yair Nissimi and Dror Segen-Cohen, both army privates, pleadedguilty in the burial case to reduced charges of shameful behavior.The plea bargain would give Nissimi 2{ months in jail andSegen-Cohel two months, and both would be placed on probation.   A three-judge panel is to rule March 29 on whether to accept thearrangement.   Sgt. Maj. Charlie Danino pleaded innocent to assault andunbecoming conduct, and is expected to argue that he was not at thescene.   Mustafa Hamdan, one of those buried, said of the plea bargain:``They buried four people alive. If an Arab did that they wouldhave given him 200 years.''   Defense lawyer Josef Danai said in court the burial was ``aninstance of letting off steam, revenge and deterrence'' by soldiersin difficult circumstances.   ``We have to view this in its proper proportion,'' he said.``After all, what did they do? They spilled a little earth on them.The tractor driver said an ant could have gotten out of it.''   Danai said the army was sending to the occupied territories``young boys inexperienced in life who ... are unable to handlethis difficult mission.'' Sgt. Amichai Vaturi, who was at the scenebut is not charged, testified that the Arabs were covered withabout two feet of wet earth but their heads and shoulders wereexposed.   Hamdan said the heads of three men were covered.   In the beating case, Sagi Harpaz and Yehuda Angel, armyprivates, pleaded innocent to assault and the case was recessed.   Angel's lawyer, David Ofek, called the defendants scapegoats.``The orders to soldiers were to break arms and legs of Arabinciters they capture,'' he said.   Two other soldiers were sentenced Tuesday to 10 and 21 days injail for minor roles in the beating.   In the Gaza Strip, Arabs armed with a pistol and an assaultrifle shot 44-year-old Israeli contractor Adi Tzabaria severaltimes in the legs near the Jabaliya refugee camp, said Ilana Ziv,spokesman for Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon.   The army confirmed the shooting. It was the first time anIsraeli, civilian or soldier, has been reported hit by Arab gunfiresince the beginning of what Palestinians now call ``the uprising.''   An Arab truck driver in the same area tried to run down anIsraeli soldier earlier Thursday but he escaped without injury, thearmy said.   Arab reports from Jabaliya said the army fired tear gas andrubber bullets at 800 schoolgirls who stoned soldiers, raisedPalestinian flags and burned tires.   Officials of a U.N. clinic said 25 girls were treated for minorinjuries. The camp was placed under curfew.   Palestine Press Service, an Arab-run news agency, said soldiersin the West Bank arrested 150 Palestinians overnight in Nablus,Jenin, Qabitiyeh, Ramallah and Hebron. The army said it wasinvestigating the report.   Arab reporters said the army blocked dairy and producedeliveries to Nablus, Tulkarm and Jericho. An army spokesmen saidthe reports were being checked.</TEXT></DOC>
