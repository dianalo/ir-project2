(Field-programmable gatearray)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Baker, Stan.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Xilinx Inc, the originator of programmable gate arrays, hasdeveloped a 20,000-gate field-programmable gate array (FPGA).andO;Built using a new complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)process, the device will have higher circuit speeds and increaseddensity over other programmable gate arrays.andP;  The market for CMOSprogrammable logic devices is growing fast, and sales of FPGAs areexpected to top $500 million by 1994.andP;  Xilinx will ship 500,000FPGAs per quarter during 1989, and year-end sales will exceed $45million.andP;  The CMOS FPGAs will use a new cell design and newrouting resources, incorporate SRAM cells of up to 24K-bits, haveup to 240 I/Os and four global clocks.andP;  Xilinx is also developingcomputer-aided engineering tools for the implementation of theFPGA designs.andP;  Partner Advanced Micro Devices Inc will alsointroduce a new generation of FPGAs in 1990.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Xilinx Inc.
