The loss compared with year-earlier profit of 708 millionkronor. Revenue climbed 2% to 7.98 billion kronor.</LP><TEXT>   Nordbanken, 71% state-controlled, blamed the red ink on adeepening nosedive by Swedish property markets that hasclobbered real estate and finance companies who are bigborrowers. But Chief Executive Hans Dalborg also tracedNordbanken's present straits to excessive lending riskscondoned by previous management in a pursuit of growth tocatch up with Sweden's two leading banks, SkandinaviskaEnskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken. Combined withinadequate credit controls and a string of failedacquisitions, he said, &quot;the losses are a consequence of thespeculative credit balloon, blown up during the carnivalyears of 1987-1989, which now has burst.&quot;   The loss exceeded the most pessimistic estimates ofanalysts.   Mr. Dalborg insisted that despite the losses, &quot;Nordbankenremains a sound bank able to absorb even losses of thismagnitude.&quot; The bank's proposed 5.2 billion kronor offeringof new shares -- guaranteed by the Swedish government -- willboost its decimated capital ratio to about 8.5% from acurrent 5.8% adjusted for the losses so far this year.   Moody's Investors Service Inc. quickly placed its ratingof Nordbanken debt under review for possible downgrade. TheU.S. rating agency said the action was taken in light of theloss reported yesterday and the potential impact of acontinued weak Swedish economy on Nordbanken's future assetquality.</TEXT></DOC>
