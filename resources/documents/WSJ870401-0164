Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota (&quot;Notable and Quotable,&quot; editorial page, March 18) suggests in his memoirs that the U.S. should tax imports from countries that benefit from the U.S. military umbrella in order to defray American defense costs.    Mr. McCarthy illustrates the Pavlovian extreme to which public discussion of international economics has degenerated. Name a political or economic problem and one quickly finds politicians salivating over import restrictions as the solution.    Mr. McCarthy correctly recognizes that U.S. allies are taking a free ride on American taxpayers. However, if we want our allies to pay more for the U.S. defense umbrella, then they must send more of their output to the U.S., not less as Mr. McCarthy suggests.    The situation is analogous to a country-store owner who trades rifles for a farmer's grain crop. If the store owner wants to receive more for his rifles, he doesn't tell the farmer to give him less grain.    What is true for an individual supplier of rifles must also be true for a nation that supplies military services. Instead of defraying defense costs, Mr. McCarthy's suggestion is tantamount to the U.S. shooting itself in the foot.    Could it be that his proposal merely camouflages an agenda to weaken the U.S. defense posture?    Matthias Mitman   Asst.
