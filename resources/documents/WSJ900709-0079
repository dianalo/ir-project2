Thrift regulators and Justice Department officials saidlast week that newly formed investigative teams drawn fromseveral federal agencies would review fraud allegationsinvolving these 100 Sandamp;Ls. The officials declined to identifythe targeted institutions. Eventually, enforcers intend todraw up a list of 300 to 400 major thrift-fraud cases toinvestigate, a total far smaller than previous estimates andone sure to draw criticism from Democratic lawmakers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The numbers haven't been perfected yet,&quot; said actingDeputy Attorney General William Barr. &quot;But it's a universe ofhundreds&quot; of potential major cases. Allegations ofsubstantial fraud in commercial banks could add another&quot;couple hundred&quot; cases to the government's list of targets,he said. Thousands of allegations of fraud involving $25,000or less are likely to remain unaddressed, officialsacknowledged.   The criteria used for selecting the top 100 cases includedthe amount of losses attributed to illegal actions, theegregiousness of allegedly fraudulent behavior by thriftexecutives and borrowers, and the size of the institutionsinvolved. No additional resources, beyond those alreadyannounced, will be deployed to address the worst cases,officials said. Instead, prosecutors and investigators willbe reassigned to problem areas, such as Kansas and Florida,Mr. Barr said.   The purposeful disclosure of the list of high-prioritycases is one of a series of actions by the administration todemonstrate its seriousness in addressing the Sandamp;L mess.Attorney General Richard Thornburgh previously announced theformation of a variety of regional task forces and theappointment of special officials to coordinate prosecution ofthrift fraud. President Bush himself attended a recentcampaign-style rally at the Justice Department, where heexhorted federal prosecutors flown in from all over thecountry to &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot; when investigating Sandamp;Limproprieties.   Many of these same prosecutors, as well as seniorofficials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, say,however, that the Reagan and Bush administrations, as well asCongress, haven't provided sufficient resources to battle awave of potential criminal cases that began to overwhelmenforcers as early as the mid-eighties.   Separately, a Senate subcommittee chaired by Sen. HowardMetzenbaum (D., Ohio) plans a hearing today on the FederalHome Loan Bank Board's December 1988 sale of 15 Texas Sandamp;Ls toan Arizona insurance businessman who had been charged withsecurities fraud in 1976.   Mr. Metzenbaum plans to question former Bank Boardofficials and state insurance regulators about thetransaction in which James Fail bought the insolvent thriftsusing $1,000 of his own, $70 million in borrowings, andanother $50 million he pledged to invest over the next twoyears. The government put up $1.85 billion of assistance inthe deal.   Mr. Fail was charged with securities fraud in Alabama, butthe charges were dropped and Mr. Fail agreed not to sellinsurance in the state. However, one of Mr. Fail's companiespleaded guilty to securities fraud in Alabama, investigatorsfor Mr. Metzenbaum have learned.   Mr. Metzenbaum also intends to investigate the role playedby an ex-aide to President Bush, Robert Thompson, who wroteletters to Bank Board officials to help Mr. Fail bid for theTexas thrifts, according to Mr. Metzenbaum's investigation.Mr. Thompson had previously handled congressional contactsfor Mr. Bush when Mr. Bush was vice president.   Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson couldn't be reached for comment.A press spokesman for Sen. Metzenbaum said Mr. Fail, Mr.Thompson, and Danny Wall, who was chairman of the Bank Boardwhen the thrifts were sold, declined invitations to testifytoday.   ---   Paul Duke Jr. contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
