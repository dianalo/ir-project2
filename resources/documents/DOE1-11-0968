The development startedin 1980, and ended in 1982 when the system was installed. The activitiesperformed for research and development include testing of the high-temperaturesolar collector for its heat collecting efficiency and durability, thedevelopment of a popular type high-temperature solar collector, and thedevelopment of technology for optimal operation control. The test-elaboratedsolar collector is based on an existing general vacuum-tube type, butincorporates a reflecting mirror for light collection. Software was developedfor optimal operation control. This paper also discusses the monitorrun in 1983, an outline of the operation instructions, and the processesfor installing the equipment. (7 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
