Someone had the bright idea of a debate between two academic eminences, and happened to mention it to the then undersecretary of the treasury. A puckish Paul Volcker replied that if you balance the world's greatest proponent of fixed rates and the world's greatest proponent of floating rates, you still won't know what to think.    The debate never took place, the proposed contestants being equally skeptical. As events unfolded, the late Prof. Harry Johnson, the floater, derided our views, while Prof. Robert Mundell, the fixer, became one of our favorite gurus. But both influenced our exchange-rate commentary, for at the University of Chicago in the 1960s, they were pioneers in what academic jargon calls &quot;the monetary approach to the balance of payments.&quot;    With the dollar becoming the big topic of the new year, sensitive readers may notice that our editorials on exchange rates employ a rather distinct vocabulary. While nearly everyone else is talking about the trade deficit, our comments focus instead on the supply and demand for dollars. This is because, educated by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Mundell, we think of exchange rates as a monetary phenomenon.    The conventional approach is to think of the exchange rate as a reaction to the real economy. Thus, American consumers want to buy too much from foreigners; the dollar has to fall to make imports more expensive and exports cheaper; but while waiting for the &quot;elasticity effect&quot; and the &quot;J-curve,&quot; you need to attract foreign loans to finance imports, and thus need to raise interest rates. So &quot;defending the dollar&quot; is likely to cause a recession.    If you see exchange rates as a monetary phenomenon, you see a different world. Trade, for example, is something that happens in the real sector. Growing economies consume imports, but also attract investment to finance them.    In the monetary approach a falling dollar means simply that the supply of dollars exceeds the demand. If the Fed wants to defend the dollar, it need only contract the supply, selling some of its assets-government bonds, foreign currencies or gold. As private purchasers pay for these assets, the supply of dollars shrinks and the price of the dollar rises. Technically this is always possible, though of course the practical issue is what effect it would have on interest rates and the real economy.    While the monetary approach provides a clear framework in which to think about these crucial questions, it does not dictate the answers. As its Chicago roots suggest, the monetary approach is in many respects an outgrowth of monetarist economics, with its emphasis on the importance of the &quot;money supply.&quot; Changes in the value of two currencies depend on the &quot;money supply&quot; of each. But as the Johnson-Mundell differences suggest, the monetary approach has two branches.    The economists usually thought of as monetarists are staunch floaters. The whole notion was that Harry Johnson's floating rates would isolate the U.S. from bothersome foreign influences, so that Milton Friedman's M1 could grow at its steady 3% a year. If the supply of another currency grew at another pace, the exchange rate would adjust a bit and everyone could live happily ever after. Monetarists, including Beryl Sprinkel at the White House and Lief Olsen as an apparent candidate for the Federal Reserve Board, still cling to this dream today.    Yet floating rates swing more widely than this benign view ever suggested, causing pain that other economists, businessmen and politicians find intolerable. Economies must adjust back and forth between export and domestic markets, with layoffs and capital reallocations that seem capricious. Exchange rates are volatile, we now see, because the price of a currency is determined not only by supply but also demand. Contrary to the assumptions underlying both international and domestic monetarism, demand for a currency is anything but stable.    In particular, holders of dollar assets are hypersensitive to an oversupply of dollars. If the Fed supplies a few too many dollars and the exchange rate starts to fall a little, asset holders cut back their demand for dollars and the exchange rate falls a lot. As asset holders reduce their dollar deposits, statistical measures of the &quot;money supply&quot; will fall. Monetarists following these figures will start charging that the Fed has been creating too few dollars and should print more. In this kind of spiral, which is more or less where we found ourselves at year end, exchange rates &quot;overshoot.&quot;    The first days of the new year, of course, have seen a massive effort by the Fed and other central banks to bolster the dollar by selling other currencies and buying dollars. The ultimate success of this effort will depend on whether these interventions are &quot;sterilized.&quot; That is, whether while the Fed is selling Deutsche marks it is buying other assets such as Treasury bills, leaving bank reserves and the money stock unchanged. But if the interventions look serious, the demand for dollars may start to increase and the spiral could unwind with surprising speed.    Would this &quot;raise interest rates&quot; and cause a recession? Other things being equal, smaller bank reserves are likely to mean banks will need to bid more vigorously for short-term deposits, leading to higher short-term rates. But slower reserve growth would also mean less likelihood of inflation at home and a lower dollar abroad, so both domestic and foreign purchasers would find long-term debt more attractive. Long-term rates might actually fall, as indeed bonds have tended to rally with talk of defending the dollar.    In the new year, markets will make the test, not only of the value of the dollar but of the usefulness of different views of the world economy. Perhaps they will decide that debate we never managed to hold.    ---   Mr. Bartley is editor of the Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
