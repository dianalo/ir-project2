In this paper, some guidelinesare proposed for partial or full protection in order to prevent possibledamage to the pipeline. The techniques of determining the magnitudesand locations of the maximum tensile and compressive stresses on thepipeline are developed. They are based on the assumptions that the pipelinesare thin and that the ground subsidence can be predicted by the probabilityfunction integration method fairly well. Two computer programs whichhave been developed to assist in the determination of the optimal controlparameters of a subsidence profile and to evaluate the stresses on thepipeline are described. 4 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
