The eight major automakers said they sold vehicles at an averagedaily rate of 34,994 during the June 1-10 period this year comparedwith 34,621 during the same time last year. Car sales were up 1.3percent and truck sales rose 0.7 percent.   Analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New Yorksaid the sales pace was higher than he expected. But he saidnonetheless that incentives are having a less pronounced effect onsales.   ``The surge that you got this time got sales up temporarily,''Healy said. ``You used to get a spike when these things came out andnow it's a yawn.''   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. had newincentive programs in effect in early June, replacing those thatbegan in April. But they apparently failed to attract a significantnumber of buyers over last year, when sales ran a little below whatproved to be the annual trend.   Ford's early-June car sales rose, while sales at GM and Chryslerfell. Conversely, light truck sales rose at GM and Chrysler and fellat Ford.   So far this year, car and truck sales by the eight domesticmakers were running 3.3 percent behind the pace of last year, thesecond-best sales year on record.

GM's car sales through June 10 this year were 8.5 percent behindlast year and truck sales were off 1.3 percent.
